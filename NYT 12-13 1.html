The Fires were introduced two years ago, and this is their second update in a tablet environment that is brutally competitive.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/technology/for-2nd-generation-of-surface-tweaks-from-microsoft.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Microsoft, for instance, </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/technology/for-2nd-generation-of-surface-tweaks-from-microsoft.html" class="a" target="_blank">announced</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24203271" class="s1" target="_blank">the new generation of its struggling Surface tablets earlier this week. And the devices are getting more proprietary. Tesco, a supermarket chain in Britain, </a><u>introduced </u><span style=" color: #000;">a tablet this week for its customers.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon said the Kindle Fire HDX, at 8.9 inches, would be 34 percent lighter than the previous model. It would have a faster memory and a faster processor, and 11 hours of battery time for mixed use. If you did nothing but read, it would be 17 hours.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In its announcement<span class="p">, Amazon trumpeted the Fire’s new “Mayday” button, which it will be promoted in television commercials. Tap the button and you will be connected to an Amazon expert “24×7, 365 days a year.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Which brings up the question: Why is this feature needed? Were the previous Fires so complicated that they confused customers?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Amazon public relations team was not as voluble as the Mayday squad, and no answer was forthcoming Tuesday night.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(An Amazon spokeswoman later said that earlier Fires did not confuse customers.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The cheapest Fire will sell for $139, a substantial discount from the previous version. But it is hard to tell how the Fire is doing because Amazon does not release sales figures. This is clear: It is very far behind the iPad. Apple sold about $33 billion worth of iPads in the last year. Amazon’s total revenue in 2012 was less than twice that, and Amazon sells many, many other things besides Kindles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“The challenge for Amazon is expanding its appeal beyond Amazon’s super fans,” said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forester analyst. “They’re not the market leader, or anywhere near it. The risk is they fall by the wayside like Barnes &amp; Noble — max out their base and then have nowhere to go.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Next up, according to the rumors: Kindle TV, a set-top device that will feed Amazon’s growing selection of video content directly into living rooms.

She was 50.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The police said that a minivan apparently making deliveries for OnTrac, a shipping service used by Amazon and other online retailers, was turning onto a side road when the accident occurred along Skyline Boulevard. Ms.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Covey was pronounced dead at the scene. The van driver was not charged.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">As Amazon’s first chief financial officer, Ms. Covey helped take the company public and was an</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">independent-minded advocate for Amazon’s plans to ignore Wall Street and invest for the future. That notion, radical in its day, was the foundation for Amazon’s growth into a $61 billion retailing and entertainment behemoth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In its early days, Amazon prided itself on its unconventional hires, telling staffing agencies to “send us your freaks.” Ms. Covey did not have a traditional background. She dropped out of high school at 15 and worked as a grocery clerk. She attended Cal State Fresno and later Harvard Law School, where, she said, she did not fit in.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/2002/summer/closing_main.html" class="s1" target="_blank">“We’d go to lunch and people would talk about their favorite 17th-century poets, and I’d be thinking, ‘Could I even name five poets? </a><a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/2002/summer/closing_main.html" target="_blank">From any century?’ “</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But after joining Amazon in late 1996, when its annual revenue was less than $20 million, she thrived. She sold Wall Street the debt that the company needed to expand. The company went public on May 14, 1997, with an initial offering price of $18. Shares this week were selling for more than $312. Her own wealth is estimated at more than $200 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Joy Dianne Covey was born on April 25, 1963, in Boston, to Maurice C. Covey, a physician, and the former Joan De Vries, a nurse. She grew up in San Mateo and lived in Woodside, Calif.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As the senior woman in a red-hot Internet company, Ms. Covey drew a great deal of attention, including a profile in Forbes magazine headlined “A Real Amazon.”</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She left Amazon in 2000, as the dot-com boom was ending. Survivors include a young son, Tyler.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/google-and-former-genentech-chief-announce-new-biotech-company/">Tech Titans Form Biotechnology Company</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/the-cloud-era-begins-for-enterprise-tech/" class="a" target="_blank">The Cloud Era Begins for Enterprise </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/the-cloud-era-begins-for-enterprise-tech/" target="_blank">Tech</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/amazon-couples-print-digital-books-with-new-program/">Amazon Pairs Print and Digital Books With New Program</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/disruptions-a-blogger-mocks-the-denizens-of-silicon-valley/">Disruptions: A Blogger Mocks the Denizens of Silicon Valley</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/daily-report-pentagon-becomes-source-of-support-for-silicon-valley/">Daily Report: Pentagon Becomes Source of Support for Silicon Valley</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Joy Covey was Amazon.com’s first chief financial officer. | Joy Covey was Amazon.com’s first chief financial officer.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020130919e99j003e9</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_005.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4">BITS</a><a name="bookmark5">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon to Pair Print and E-Books</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By NICK WINGFIELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">699 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">9 September 2013 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 5</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">For most readers, print and electronic books are an either-or proposition. There just isn&#39;t a compelling reason to buy both editions of one book, at least not at full price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon is about to test how much appetite there is for combined print-and-digital book purchases if it cuts the price of Kindle books to less than that of a Starbucks latte.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On Tuesday, the company plans to announce a new program, Kindle MatchBook, that lets its customers buy the electronic versions of books they have already purchased in print form for either $2.99, $1.99, $0.99 or free.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s far less than the $11 or more that Amazon typically charges for standalone purchases of the latest Kindle titles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One benefit of MatchBook is that Amazon will let its customers buy Kindle editions of books that they purchased in print as far back as 1995, the year Amazon opened for business. The discounted Kindle edition prices apply to book purchases made in the future on Amazon too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In an interview, Russ Grandinetti, vice president of Kindle Content, said one of the most common requests Amazon receives from its Kindle customers is a way to build parallel print and digital book libraries, which hasn&#39;t been practical at full retail prices. He said many print lovers will enjoy Kindle features like text searching of books, especially reference books. Kindle fans, meanwhile, still want print editions of books as souvenirs and art objects.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;A lot of people are really attached to the idea of sticking books on a shelf,&#39;&#39; Mr. Grandinetti said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">There&#39;s little doubt some book fans exist who are as enthusiastic about the benefits of e-books as they are wistful for the sight of colorful book spines on their walls. The question is how many of them there are.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The success of the program will be determined partly by whether book publishers embrace it. So far, Amazon has agreements from only a couple of major publishers -- HarperCollins was the only one Mr. Grandinetti was willing to name -- to offer their titles through MatchBook.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">He said Amazon hadn&#39;t told most publishers about MatchBook yet and hoped to sign more up to join the program, which will begin in October. He predicted there will be more than 10,000 books available for purchase through MatchBook, including &#39;&#39;A Prayer for Owen Meany&#39;&#39; by John Irving, &#39;&#39;I Know This Much is True&#39;&#39; by Wally Lamb and &#39;&#39;The Thorn Birds&#39;&#39; by Colleen McCullough.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Although publishers have shown discomfort with Amazon&#39;s outsize clout in book retailing, Mr. Grandinetti said he doesn&#39;t expect a lot of resistance, because MatchBook represents an &#39;&#39;incremental revenue stream for publishers and authors.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Even if Amazon gets widespread buy-in from publishers, it isn&#39;t clear whether a discounted combined price will be compelling. In some cases, the price for Kindle editions of older books is already very low (the Kindle version of &#39;&#39;A Prayer for Owen Meany&#39;&#39; is $2.99, for example). MatchBook will make little difference to a print buyer of that book unless Amazon drops the Kindle price to almost nothing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">For the latest bestsellers like Sheryl Sandberg&#39;s &#39;&#39;Lean In,&#39;&#39; the value could look better. Amazon currently sells the print and Kindle editions for standalone prices of $12.81 and $10.99, respectively. Assuming that Ms. Sandberg&#39;s</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">book becomes available through MatchBook and that Amazon doesn&#39;t jack up the print price of the book, an e-book and print package for &#39;&#39;Lean In&#39;&#39; would cost $15.80 or less.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Does the nostalgia for print run deep enough among Kindle users to justify the extra price, though, and is there really much hunger for digital editions of long-ago print purchases?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon&#39;s chief executive, is fiendishly good at selling people things they didn&#39;t necessarily know they needed. If he can&#39;t sell two books for the price of a bit-more-than-one, then it&#39;s unlikely anyone can.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

What you should look for is how the old guard adapts to the cloud, and how the new guys aim to consolidate disparate offerings and win trust.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The world now passing away consisted of business systems dominated by computer servers and personal computers. The new one subsumes these into cloud computing and devices like smartphones and tablets. The inability of companies like Microsoft and Dell to cope quickly enough with this change led to their current problems. The steady, thorough way that companies like Amazon and Salesforce have used the new technology to go after their elders’ business is what makes them contenders.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Other challengers include Google, Workday and NetSuite. There are many more, but these companies in particular have both the assets and the money to build comprehensive offerings in software and services, and also to afford something like service guarantees in what many see as a still-unstable and security-challenged world.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://login.salesforce.com/help/doc/en/collab_files_overview.htm" class="s1" target="_blank">One way to do that is to become the unifying agent for all the data that companies are spreading across their servers and cloud services. On Friday, Salesforce announced </a>Salesforce Files<span class="p">, which searches through things companies have stored in Sharepoint, Dropbox, Google Drive and other storage and collaboration services.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">“The way to remove friction among all these repositories is to virtualize everything into a common repository,” said Nasi Jazayeri, general manager of Salesforce Chatter, the company’s corporate collaboration product. He added, “We’re not trying to compete with the other repositories – we’re trying to make it easier for people to find things.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Salesforce wasn’t trying to compete with the repositories because Chatterbox, its effort to do so, was a dud. But if Salesforce becomes a central hub for sorting diverse information, that loss can be a win.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Workday, which has announced that it is putting data-analysis services in its cloud-based human resources and financial software, may be making a similar move to consolidate information for customers. “Big data analytics is unifying,” said Dan Beck, Workday’s vice president of financials and analytics, since it may draw from information in, say, a Workday database and an SAP or Twitter database. “We’re broadening out our applications footprint. Customers expect that.”</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/" class="s1" target="_blank">In the past several months, Amazon has introduced a “</a>trusted advisor<a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2013/09/amazon-elasticache-redis.html" class="s1" target="_blank">” program that inspects a company’s use of Amazon Web Services, its cloud service, and suggests ways it can be better used. It has had a global series of “summits” aimed at ordinary business people along with skilled technologists, and </a><a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2013/09/amazon-elasticache-redis.html" class="a" target="_blank">built out</a><span class="s4"> </span><span class="p">a lot of big data offerings.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/google-let-a-billion-supercomputers-bloom/" class="s1" target="_blank">Google has also expanded its corporate cloud strategy, </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/google-let-a-billion-supercomputers-bloom/" class="a" target="_blank">enlisting</a> <span style=" color: #000;">more developers and guaranteeing higher performance for its cloud. It is also selling new and different ways people can use Google for big data analysis.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Big data is being sold as a way to build efficiency and gain insights. But for many of these companies, offering big data services is also a way to consolidate data for customers. If you control information, you are almost by default the trusted partner, or what is known in the business as “the single throat to choke if something goes wrong.” Jobs like that pay a premium.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Some of these older enterprise tech companies, which also include Cisco and Oracle, will make the transition, just as incumbents like I.B.M. made it from mainframe computers to servers and PC’s. Oracle’s approach is to offer a complete system, making it a single throat to choke. I.B.M. already seems to be working both camps in the new world, offering its own systems and consulting with the new players. But just as surely as all of them, in their time, supplanted big incumbents, there will be other companies coming along to topple them.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/oracle-and-salesforce-a-data-sharing-deal/" class="a" target="_blank">Oracle and Salesforce: a Data-Sharing </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/oracle-and-salesforce-a-data-sharing-deal/" target="_blank">Deal</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/28/the-cloud-company-people-or-money/" class="a" target="_blank">The Cloud Company: People or </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/28/the-cloud-company-people-or-money/" target="_blank">Money?</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/idc-predicts-an-apple-ipad-and-battles-in-the-cloud/" class="a" target="_blank">For 2010, IDC Predicts an Apple iPad and Battles in the </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/idc-predicts-an-apple-ipad-and-battles-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank">Cloud</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/google-introduces-new-desktop-apps/">Google Introduces New Desktop Apps</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/vmware-killed-the-past-can-it-claim-the-future/">VMware Killed the Past.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon.com’s founder and the prospective new owner of The Washington Post, has assured newsroom employees that he is committed to preserving quality journalism, investing in news and making sure The Post adheres to his underlying philosophy about content: ‘‘Don’t be boring.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Over the course of the day on Wednesday, he gave some indication of the kind of journalism that interested him, answered questions about The Post’s coverage of Amazon and did not disguise his interest at the intersection of his businesses, telling an afternoon meeting that ‘‘it should be as easy to get a subscription to The Post as it is to buy diapers on Amazon,’’ according to one employee who attended the meeting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The two-day visit was Mr. Bezos’ first trip to The Post since he agreed to buy the paper in early August for $250 million. With the deal set to close in October, Mr. Bezos made the visit to chat with employees from both the business and editorial sides about his plans for the company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">By the end of his visit late Wednesday, Mr. Bezos seemed to have won over employees, who posted photographs of him, speculated on how many electronic devices he had in his pockets, liberally quoted his thoughts on the news business on social media and gave him the hashtag #bezospalooza.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘He charmed the room of 20 hard-bitten journalists,’’ said Jeff Leen, The Post’s investigations editor, who attended a lunch meeting with Mr. Bezos. ‘‘He was a big supporter of investigative reporting, which warmed my heart. He already has a very good grasp of our business. It was, all in all, a very impressive performance.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos started Wednesday with an hourlong breakfast with Bob Woodward. Mr. Woodward, the longtime Post writer who gained prominence through his reporting with Carl Bernstein on the Watergate scandal in the Nixon administration, said in an e-mail after the meeting that through the breakfast, ‘‘Jeff Bezos explained the thinking behind his reasoned and careful step-by-step process in deciding to buy The Post.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Woodward added: ‘‘I was struck by how wide-ranging and methodical he is. He voiced strong, even intense, optimism about the future of The Post, and I suspect he will be calling on everyone here to pitch in with extra amounts of energy, focus and creativity.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos then met for a little more than an hour for coffee with about 20 reporters and talked about how he defined success.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘What’s been happening over the last several years can’t continue to happen,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos told reporters that the paper should focus on delivering important, compelling stories to its readers. If it does that, advertisers will come, he said. Several reporters said that message had left them feeling upbeat, convinced that Mr. Bezos was committed to high-quality journalism.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘You got the feeling that he is not here to just take the Washington Post brand name and turn it into something else,’’ said one reporter who attended and who spoke anonymously. ‘‘This is not somebody who is in a panic trying to make a profit for next year. He wants to solve it in a way that will endure for decades.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">For lunch, Mr. Bezos met with senior editors. He mentioned that some of The Post’s recent coverage that he had found especially intriguing included ‘‘9 Questions about Syria you were too embarrassed to ask’’ and the obituary of a bouncer at the 9:30 Club, a well-known Washington nightspot.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the late afternoon, Mr. Bezos met with the entire newsroom for a question-and-answer session that lasted more than an hour. That was the most widely chronicled event, with employees posting Twitter messages and comments — or what they called ‘‘Bezosisms’’ — every few minutes. Mr. Bezos answered questions about why he had decided to buy The Post and why he would be interested in buying a newspaper when Amazon had a reputation for being slow to answer reporters’ questions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Erik Wemple, The Post’s media reporter, quoted Mr. Bezos on Twitter as saying, ‘‘I’ve always felt that the most powerful minds in the world can hold powerful inconsistencies.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Toward the end of the session, Mr. Bezos addressed more difficult questions, like the possible conflict of interest between Amazon’s contract for computer work with the C.I.A. and The Post’s coverage of the agency. One employee, who attended the session but did not feel comfortable speaking on the record about the paper’s future owner, said that while Mr. Bezos ‘‘danced around’’ his answer, he added that he expected The Post to cover the relationship aggressively.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos may have offered his most reassuring comments when asked about his thoughts on journalism’s future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In a post, Cara Ann Kelly, The Post’s Style Web producer, quoted him as saying, ‘‘If it’s hopeless — I would feel sorry for you guys — but I wouldn’t want to join you.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130905e9960003b</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_009.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark12">Fashion &amp; Style</a><a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Julie Gilhart: Bouncing Back With a Digital Twist</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By BEE SHAPIRO</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">1,499 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">5 September 2013 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I’m in a completely virtual space,” Julie Gilhart said recently.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On the eve of her umpteenth Fashion Week, the former fashion director of Barneys, now a fashion consultant whose biggest client is Amazon, was reflecting on how much the pace of shopping has accelerated since her 18 years at the department store. &quot;It’s ’global’ at your fingertips, 24-7,” she said. “It puts tremendous pressure on everyone from retailers to designers and everyone in between.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ms. Gilhart is 55, but she has plunged into the churning waters of e-commerce with a millennial’s enthusiasm, bringing her famous eye for brands to the Amazon platforms Shopbop, MyHabit and Amazon Fashion and advising the company on the 40,000-square-foot photography studio it opened in Williamsburg last month. (She has leased a personal office in NeueHouse, the Gramercy private work-space collective.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“Obviously I didn’t plan this, but with the Internet it’s like I leapfrogged,” Ms. Gilhart said, praising the transparency of the online environment in the way it allows retailers to track customer preferences, among other data.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But, she said, “fashion can’t be just a technology equation, It is filled with instinct, emotion and an eye into the future.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ms. Gilhart herself has run the full gamut of emotions during her time in the industry, including shock when she was fired by Barneys’ current chief executive, Mark Lee, as part of a management shake-up in 2010. “I was like, What? Come again?” Ms. Gilhart recalled of getting the news in his office. “I remember, in slow motion, putting my coat back on. After that, it was just sort of a haze.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Sporting a deep tan from a Costa Rica surfing trip, the tall Ms. Gilhart, a Texan, seems to have found clarity in a flexible role that allows her to devote more time to pet causes like ecologically conscious clothes. (Eventually, she said, customers “will not just be seduced by the ‘fashion’ but also by how the fashion is made.”)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But it was difficult going for a while. Ms. Gilhart’s dog died and then she injured a disk in her back. Her longtime Barneys crew, which was “like family,” she said, had splintered (Judy Collinson, the executive vice president and a close friend, was also let go). And without the powerful establishment behind her, she said, “every relationship in my life changed.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One that got better was with Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor. Ms. Gilhart said Ms. Wintour had never been “particularly close” before the bad news but was the first to call after she was let go.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“She said, ‘It’s going to be fine, these things happen,’ ” said Ms. Gilhart, who would go on to broker Amazon’s sponsorship of the Costume Institute gala in 2012. “She had me immediately talking to people. She was like my fashion fairy godmother.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In an e-mail message, Ms. Wintour wrote of Ms. Gilhart: “She has always been a fearless yet kind advocate for young designers in this country and beyond.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Indeed, at the CFDA Awards in June, there was Ms. Gilhart, with her characteristic prescience, wearing a cutout frock by Suno, which that night won the Swarovksi Award for women’s wear. “She’s awesome — this cool, creative spirit in how she sees things,” said the line’s designer, Erin Beatty, before collecting the trophy.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Ms. Gilhart started in the business in 1979, with a summer job after her junior year at the University of Texas, in the epicure department of the then-new Neiman Marcus in Dallas. “That was when Cuisinart first came out,” Ms. Gilhart said. “I cleaned up that summer.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As a top saleswoman at the store, she was soon promoted to designer clothing. “I was so over college,” she said. She never graduated, getting an unofficial degree in 1980s fashion. (“Perry Ellis, Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren,” she said reverently).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">When a position as assistant to the well-respected buyer Benita Downing opened up, she pounced. “She had traveled with Stanley Marcus,” Ms. Gilhart said. “She discovered the Missonis, discovered Ungaro. Karl Lagerfeld would write her birthday cards.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ms. Downing took Ms. Gilhart to Europe for the collections and refined her eye. “Looking back, I think she’s the one who taught me how to nurture talent,” Ms. Gilhart said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">After two years, she was promoted to buyer in European knitwear, which included then up-and-comers like Azzedine Alaïa and Issey Miyake. “I was so unprepared,” she said. “I was saved in some way because business was booming.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The late ’80s and early ’90s were all about runway extravaganzas, she said: ”Scene-y in a different way. You would be at a Gaultier show, and you weren’t quite sure if you were going to get into the show or not. Today the scene is a lot more sedate. There are a lot of cameras now, a lot of people posing. There was none of that then. You were there for the show. It wasn’t about getting your picture taken.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ms. Gilhart arrived at Barneys in 1992, when it was in the midst of a national expansion. She recalled Gene Pressman, whose grandfather Barney Pressman started the business in 1923, as “a totally intimidating experience. I went into his office, and he was tossing this football. He said, ‘I only hire really good-looking people.’ I was like, ‘Uh, O.K.’ ”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">She was hired as a divisional merchandise manager, overseeing a team of buyers. Mr. Pressman became a mentor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“He was never afraid of things like Comme des Garçons,” she said. “Here’s the big difference: nowadays a lot of people look at a designer and think, ‘Can we sell that?’ And the training here was, ‘Look at a designer — your only hurdle was whether it’s good or not — and we’re going to figure out how to sell that.’ ”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One memorable appointment in Paris was with a 20-year-old Belgian, Olivier Theyskens, showing for the first time.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">“This was not a junior collection,” Ms. Gilhart recalled, animated even years later. “It was already</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">super-sophisticated.” And Mr. Pressman didn’t need convincing, she said. He operated on instinct. “You have to feel it,” she said, alluding to some private equity firms that assess fashion companies based on their spreadsheets. “There is no formula.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">While Mr. Theyskens’s initial designs were not manufactured, Barneys scooped up his second season. “They did the best buy,” said Mr. Theyskens, now 36 and the creative director of Theory.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">When the Pressmans were forced out in 1999, Ms. Gilhart took over fashion direction, and despite Barneys’ financial problems, continued to take risks. For the fall 2003 season, the store bought the entire thesis collection by two Parsons School of Design students, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez. Ms. Gilhart’s confidence in them “kick-started Proenza Schouler,” Mr. Hernandez said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She “was there through our ups and downs,” Mr. McCollough said, adding that the duo still values her advice.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ms. Gilhart also continued to endorse Mr. Theyskens. When the designer took the reins at Rochas in 2002, she arranged private runway shows where he could meet with select top shoppers. “I have a very strong memory of that,” said Mr. Theyskens. “It was one of the first times I had a real, engaging talk with specific customers. At the end of the day, our work, that’s what it’s about: to get presented and to have the customer have a relationship with the clothes.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Now that Mr. Theyskens is based in New York, the two might grab coffee and walk through the company’s meatpacking district flagship store, as they did one summer morning. Ms. Gilhart fingered a few knits and lingered over a supple leather cropped jacket. The cut was easy, a marked departure from Mr. Theyskens’s earlier work for Rochas and later Nina Ricci, which drew some criticism for their impossibly skinny fits.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ms. Gilhart, though, is adamant that buyers not intervene too much with the visionary process. “You can say things to the designer, like ‘We want more dresses,’ but you’re just following this person, lucky to engage with this talent,” she said. “And if you have a hiccup in the business, it’s like ‘How can we work this out?’ ”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It’s unclear what kind of traction Amazon will get in the world of New York fashion, but Ms. Collinson, now at Dior, seemed confident that her former colleague would survive regardless.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">“Julie is like a dog with a bone; she is constantly searching,” Ms. Collinson said. “She was, is, tenacious.” Julie Gilhart has reinvented herself as a fashion consultant focusing on Web commerce. | Casey Kelbaugh for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The New York Times | Ms. Gilhart with Stella McCartney in 2012. | Photo-Jonathon Ziegler/PatrickMcMullan.com | Attending the Suno show during New York Fashion Week in February. | Chelsea Lauren/Getty Images</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020130904e995001e9</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_010.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark14">Taking Note Opinion</a><a name="bookmark15">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Buy a Book, Get an E-Book, Too</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By VIKAS BAJAJ</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">407 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">4 September 2013 NYT Blogs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

But strangely bundling has never really taken off, despite Barnes &amp; Noble</a><a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/42319-barnes-amp-noble-to-test-bundling-e-books-p-books.html" class="a" target="_blank">experimenting with the concept</a> <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/amazon-couples-print-digital-books-with-new-program/" class="s1" target="_blank">a few years ago. And it’s unclear how many books Amazon’s new service will include when it starts in October. The company has only announced the name of one major publisher, HarperCollins, who has agreed to participate in MatchBook, </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/amazon-couples-print-digital-books-with-new-program/" class="a" target="_blank">according to</a> <span style=" color: #000;">my colleague Nick Wingfield.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/50509-is-the-time-right-for-bundling.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Some in the publishing and retailing industries </a><a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/50509-is-the-time-right-for-bundling.html" class="a" target="_blank">have argued</a> <span style=" color: #000;">that the technical issues associated with bundling are simply too complicated. Others seem opposed on the grounds that bundling would deprive authors of the full royalties they receive on the sale of each book – print or digital.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">But from the consumer perspective, bundling print and electronic books makes perfect sense. Few readers would be willing to pay full retail price for two versions of the same book but many would be willing to pay an extra $2.99 or $1.99 to have the electronic versions of the hardback and paperback they already own.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Speaking for myself, I prefer print books when I am home or in the office because nothing beats the resolution of ink on paper, not even the Kindle’s sharp display. But when I travel, I leave my physical books behind and carry a Kindle or an iPad, so I can easily carry multiple tiles. In some cases, having an electronic copy of a print book is also useful because it is easier to search the digital version by key words and phrases. And some readers who prefer reading on an electronic device still like to own print books as ornaments that can be displayed on bookshelves, coffee tables and night stands.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Publishers and booksellers still reluctant to try bundling should look to companies in the newspaper and music businesses for inspiration. While those companies have also struggled financially like the book business, at least they are now letting their customers use their products seamlessly in the physical and digital realms.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document NYTB000020130904e9940012x</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_011.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark16">Business Day; Media &amp; Advertising</a><a name="bookmark17">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Bezos Makes First Visit to Washington Post as Owner</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">343 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">4 September 2013 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013.

Bezos, the new owner of The Washington Post, kicked off a packed, two-day visit to the paper on Tuesday, his first since purchasing the newspaper for $250 million on Aug. 5. Mr. Bezos was meeting with managers on the editorial and business sides, according to people with knowledge of his schedule, at times chaperoned by Katharine Weymouth, the publisher and a member of the Graham family from whom Mr. Bezos bought the paper.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On Wednesday, he is expected to meet with reporters, hold a noon lunch with editors, tour the Post’s printing plant in Springfield, Va., and answer questions during a meeting with the newsroom staff at 3:30 p.m.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">While Mr. Bezos can often be reticent with the press, he gave an interview to The Post that ran on Monday’s front page and said he was ready for The Post to start a new “golden era” under his ownership. Mr. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com who now serves as the company’s chairman and chief executive, bought The Post as a separate investment from Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But he told The Post that he planned to bring to the newspaper some of the same approaches that had been successful for Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“We’ve had three big ideas at Amazon that we’ve stuck with for 18 years, and they’re the reason we’re successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient,” he said. “If you replace ‘customer’ with ‘reader,’ that approach, that point of view, can be successful at The Post, too.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos said he did not expect to be involved with the daily operations of The Post.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">When Rakuten, Japan’s leading e-commerce company, introduced its Kobo e-reader in Japan in July 2012, the company’s chief executive, Hiroshi Mikitani, presented a gift to Yoshinobu Noma, the president of Kodansha, Japan’s largest publisher.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It was a T-shirt emblazoned with ‘‘Beat Amazon.’’ Mr. Mikitani wanted to signal that the two companies had no intention of slugging it out in a print-versus-digital fight in Japan.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The alliance did little to help them defend against Amazon.com. Four months later, Amazon brought its Kindle</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">e-reader to Japan. It quickly became Japan’s top-selling e-reader, gaining 38.3 percent of the market, according to the MM Research Institute, a data firm in Tokyo. Even though Kobo had beaten Kindle to market by nearly five months, it grabbed only 33 percent of Japan’s e-reader sales during the same 12-month period. Sony, which had stated its goal of selling half of all e-readers by 2012, managed to hold only 25.5 percent with its devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon sells its Kindle in 14 countries, Japan being the very latest. Misao Konishi, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to talk about the company’s goals for the Japanese market, but she did offer some insight into Amazon’s ambitions. ‘‘Every book ever printed, in every language, available to buy in 60 seconds,’’ Ms. Konishi said. ‘‘There are many things to accomplish in order to achieve that vision in Japan.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Kindle’s quick success is a stark contrast to the Japanese companies’ efforts. Until Amazon showed up, e-readers failed to live up to expectations. Sony brought out the first reader using E Ink technology in Japan in 2004, the Librie.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Buyers of the Librie, which like early Kindles showed black text on a white background, suffered from a convoluted marketplace that allowed them only to rent e-books, not buy them. Amazon, which developed its Kindle with digital books people could buy from — where else? — Amazon.com, found instant success after its introduction in the United States in 2007.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Sony stopped selling its device that year. The company’s subsequent e-readers, even after Sony developed a library of books to buy, have met with limited success.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Japan is not a big contributor to global e-reader sales, estimated at around 19.9 million units by IDC, a market research firm. MM Research said that a total of 470,000 devices had been sold there last year, and that it expected sales to climb about 10 percent, to 520,000 units, in 2014.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon’s victory over Sony and Rakuten, which got into the e-reader business when it bought the Toronto-based Kobo in November 2011, began with aggressive pricing. Amazon sold the Kindle Paperwhite for ¥7,980, or about</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">$80 at current exchange rates. Not only was its price about $40 less than it was in the United States, it also matched that of the Rakuten Kobo and the Sony PRS-T2.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">In a bid to gain market share, Rakuten dropped the price of its e-reader in July to ¥5,480, and it will continue to focus on the basic model, even as the company introduces the new high-end Kobo Aura HD in Europe and the United States this month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But Amazon was not winning just because of price. It also gave consumers another reason to prefer the Kindle. ‘‘The reason for the Kindle’s success in Japan is the same as it was in America,’’ said Munechika Nishida, author</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">of ‘‘The Truth About the E-book Revolution’’ and a technology analyst. ‘‘The Amazon Web store is the easiest to use, the easiest to understand.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Sony and Rakuten’s e-readers are not technologically inferior to the Kindle, Mr. Nishida said, but buying e-books on the Kindle marketplace takes fewer steps. Rakuten and Sony’s devices make browsing and purchasing more difficult, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Japan Kindle store, which opened last October, offers more than 140,000 Japanese-language titles. It added 7,000 more titles in just the past 30 days. Kodansha now has 10,617 e-book titles available on the Kindle marketplace.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Kobo store advertises more than 130,000 e-books, but its limited search capabilities make browsing difficult. The Sony marketplace offers more than 108,000 Japanese-language titles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Rakuten’s latest bid to challenge the global dominance of companies like Amazon came Monday, with the announcement that it planned to purchase Viki, a Singapore-based video streaming platform similar to the U.S. site Hulu, but known for its focus on popular television dramas from South Korea and Taiwan and on anime. The details of the deal are not yet public, but the Japanese e-commerce giant will reportedly pay $200 million for the on-demand television and movie-streaming site, which was founded in 2007.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Before the Kindle’s arrival, Kobo and Sony’s marketplaces each offered fewer than 80,000 e-book titles. Without a popular marketplace, Rakuten and Sony failed to convince the top two Japanese publishers, Kodansha and Shogakukan, of the profit-generating potential in e-books. Digitalization of their titles proceeded slowly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon, however, had experience in the United States selling e-books and brought that experience to Japan. That made all the difference for fence-sitting publishers experiencing dwindling profits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Sales of books and magazines in Japan declined 3.6 percent in 2012, according to the Research Institute for Publications, the eighth consecutive year of declining sales. E-book and e-magazine sales, however, increased an estimated 18 percent, and the growth potential for e-publishing in Japan is expected to increase following proposed changes in copyright law announced last month by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. The changes, aimed at combating piracy and developing the e-book industry in Japan, are on the agenda for next year’s Parliament session.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Nao Takada, a 26-year-old employee of the Japan Automobile Federation, was visiting a Tokyo bookstore, but she, like readers in other parts of the world, may be buying less there. She said she had bought the Kindle Paperwhite because it was small and easy to carry, and she added that she liked the ease with which she could browse purchases.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘I still go to regular bookstores,’’ Ms. Takada said, ‘‘but a lot of times I just browse, find something to buy, then go home and download it on Amazon.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the Jimbocho neighborhood of Tokyo, famous for more than 100 years for its used and specialty bookshops, Hiroshi Kobayashi of Komiyama Books said people sometimes used their smartphones to snap photos of books they planned to download later. Still, he said that he did not consider the Kindle a threat to his livelihood — yet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Eventually, they’ll begin making electronic versions of these older, rare books,’’ Mr. Kobayashi said. ‘‘Then I’ll have something to worry about.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130902e9930003k</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_013.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark20">B</a><a name="bookmark21">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">JAPAN&#39;S E-READER INDUSTRY STRUGGLES TO KEEP UP AS AMAZON TAKES THE LEAD</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By JOSHUA HUNT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">58 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">2 September 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">7</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Often a corporation with a grand dream to reshape a city wants tax breaks in return. Not Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">When Amazon.com executives showed up last year for the first meetings about their proposal to build a new headquarters here — three towers that would draw thousands of workers downtown — city officials were taken aback. Not by the scope of the plan, but by the simplicity of the discussion. The executives said they were ready to break ground immediately on what would be one of the biggest development projects in city history.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">‘‘It was not a hard-boiled negotiation,’’ said Marshall Foster, the director of city planning. ‘‘They basically walked in and said, ‘We think this is the site.’’’ A shovel-ready company that is clear and confident and with the cash to back it up ‘‘doesn’t happen very often,’’ Mr. Foster added.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, has a reputation for the grand gesture, a knack for seizing an opportunity that can remake a landscape. His purchase of The Washington Post this month for $250 million cash, a bet that others might have shied away from, is a case in point.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Here, in his company’s hometown, Mr. Bezos has put his chips on the idea of Seattle and urban America itself. The first headquarters tower is already under construction, and the company occupies 14 smaller buildings nearby.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The result in South Lake Union, previously a low-rise, low-rent warehouse district with ties to Seattle’s gritty maritime past, is a flood of cash, construction detours and dust. Increases to the city’s tax base aside, some people are apprehensive about whether the growth could outstrip the city’s ability to keep up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">‘‘South Lake Union was a place that people drove through, not to,’’ John Schoettler, Amazon’s director of global real estate and facilities, said in an interview. ‘‘Once we started development there, everything started to spring up around us.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The once-empty streets are flooded at lunchtime with Amazon workers, easily identified by their blue employee badges. Fleets of food trucks have arrived, offering Thai, Mexican and other fare. On a nice day, workers take their lunches to a park next to the Museum of History and Industry, which was recently renovated with a $10 million contribution from Mr. Bezos.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The company already has about 15,000 employees in Seattle, mostly highly paid engineers, managers and programmers, out of a global work force of about 97,000, according to people familiar with its head count who were not authorized to discuss a figure that the company does not share publicly. The new towers have a capacity for 12,000, giving the company room for nearly 30,000 workers in Seattle, which has a population of 635,000.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Nobody else in the downtown area has ever had this kind of impact,’’ said Matt Griffin, a 35-year veteran of the Seattle economic scene and the managing partner at the Pine Street Group, a real estate marketing and development company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">But the Amazon effect only starts with its own big numbers. The thousands of new employees, recently hired or anticipated, have also caught the attention of apartment developers. Last year, Seattle issued more new</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">residential building permits than in any year since at least 1984, when the current system of record-keeping began.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Many of those new apartments are within walking or biking distance of Amazon. Service businesses and start-up technology companies, meanwhile, have sought nearby addresses. Northeastern University, based in Boston, set up a remote campus last year across the street from Amazon’s current buildings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘I think they’ve single-handedly defined a whole region,’’ said Bryan Trussel, the chief executive of Glympse, an Internet start-up with offices next to Amazon. ‘‘Now everyone wants to be there.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The setting is significant. In casting its lot in the center of a congested, bustling city, Amazon has rejected the old model of the suburban company campus that is typical of Silicon Valley and the technology ring road around Boston. The old way is perhaps most vividly exemplified by Microsoft. Its offices, and most of its 42,000 local employees, are in the suburb of Redmond.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But it was, perhaps paradoxically, Microsoft money that made Amazon’s torrid growth in the neighborhood possible. In the early 1990s, Paul Allen, Microsoft’s billionaire co-founder, agreed to help finance the creation of a public park starting in South Lake Union, a project that was eventually killed by voters. As a result, Mr. Allen’s investment firm, Vulcan, ended up being a big landowner in the area, eventually selling or leasing many of its buildings to Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Other technology companies are moving into urban spaces. Twitter and Dropbox, the social networking and online storage services, have made San Francisco home, while Tumblr and Etsy, blogging and shopping sites, are in New York. Google has huge urban spaces from Paris to Pittsburgh.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The appeal of cities to potential employees is part of the reason for the shift. An urban setting, with access to good restaurants, nightclubs and cultural attractions, has become as important a recruiting tool as salary or benefits for many companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But most of those urban pioneers are still small, at least in their real estate and staffing needs. Twitter, one of the largest, employs about 1,500 workers in San Francisco.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon, by contrast, is both local and global. By encouraging its employees to live within walking distance, it could help Seattle meet its goals for energy efficiency and conservation, city officials said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As part of its development agreement, Amazon also plans to buy a new streetcar for the light rail line that runs past its properties and pay for a stretch of dedicated bicycle lane.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Schoettler, Amazon’s real estate director, said environmental considerations were an important factor in the company’s decision to remain in Seattle, along with the type of employee that an urban location attracts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘The energy and excitement from employees being in an urban environment — I hear it daily,’’ said Mr. Schoettler, who walks to work. ‘‘A lot of people don’t even have a car. They want that urban experience right there.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">By contrast, Microsoft’s private bus line, called the Connector, is a common sight snaking through neighborhoods in Seattle and other local communities. Of the company’s 42,012 employees in the Seattle area, nearly half are registered to ride, a spokeswoman for the company said in an e-mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s transformative rush presents challenges for Seattle. Officials must manage the de facto</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">city-within-a-city that is emerging around the company, with a surge of new restaurants, apartment complexes and commercial buildings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The new headquarters has limited parking, putting pressure on mass transit, which was crimped this year by a financing stalemate in the State Legislature. The city wants low-cost housing in the Amazon zone, but soaring rents and real estate prices, city officials said, will make that goal difficult to achieve. The company’s business model, and tactics in avoiding state sales taxes in many states, also challenge retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">And the company’s mostly young work force may want to raise children here, requiring a new public school where none exists.

It&#39;s mildly irritating, but it has never occurred to me that those moments are worth freaking out over.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Such restraint was not universally exercised on Monday, when people ran to social media to voice outrage about a rare Amazon service hiccup.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">That followed a pattern that we have come to expect now, after a week in which several of the Internet&#39;s biggest companies went dark for a time. Google did not work for five minutes the other day, while parts of Microsoft&#39;s Outlook.com Web mail service were out of commission for several days last week. A problem during regular site maintenance knocked the Web site of The New York Times offline for a couple of hours last week, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Of course, the downtime presents some sort of financial consequences for these companies. BuzzFeed took out its calculator and decided that Amazon could lose $1,104 in sales for every second its American site was down.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re like me, you simply went back when the site resumed service and made your purchase then. Around the time Amazon went dark, I was about to buy an air mattress for some house guests coming to visit. Once the short shutdown was over, I made my order, and I have the utmost confidence my mattress is being stuffed into a corrugated cardboard box at an Amazon warehouse.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Some Web breakdowns are, of course, more serious. EBay had a well-known one that lasted nearly a full day back in 1999, when people were just beginning to realize how vexing it could be when always-on dot-com services vanished from their browsers. Investors crushed eBay&#39;s stock back then.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s stock closed up slightly on Monday.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Still, there is still impatience when the Web&#39;s favorite sites disappear, as Amazon did Monday. And people let it be known.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Someday, our televisions will be smart. With a flick of the wrist or a voice command, couch potatoes will be able to binge-view “Scandal” or children can watch an episode of the Disney series “Dog With a Blog.” Maybe just thinking about Walter White will bring up “Breaking Bad” on the big screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">But for now, most television sets are dumb. They do a good enough job handling the signals coming through an antenna or a set-top box, but to take advantage of the wealth of programming available through online services and apps, you generally need to attach a streaming device to the TV.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm" class="s1" target="_blank">These devices are like portals to a parallel universe of television programming. They provide access to all the episodes of the Emmy-nominated “House of Cards” and stockpiles of timeless black-and-white films, courtesy of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, as well as to the Web comedies and endless viral videos on YouTube. This year, Netflix cited the proliferation of these devices — “</a>inexpensive smart TV adapters<span class="p">,” it called them — when it predicted that on-demand and mobile TV would be the rule instead of the exception.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">To back up its prediction, the company also stated that “smart TV sales are increasing and eventually every TV will have Wi-Fi and apps.” Some already do. But until all TVs are smart, it falls on the backs of these streaming devices — most of them handy, but none of them yet perfect — to help a staid TV dip a cord into the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">THE GAMERS Millions of Americans already have a streaming device connected to a TV. Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation and Nintendo Wii video game consoles offer streaming video options and are among the most popular ways to tap into Internet TV.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">With a few simple clicks, the consoles can download apps for services like Netflix and Amazon Instant Video. Downloading them is free, but many require a paid subscription to actually stream video. (An Xbox also requires a subscription to the Xbox Live service for use of its Internet interface.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The consoles’ controllers make navigating through lists of TV shows a breeze. And with the Xbox and PlayStation, there is also the option of buying an individual episode or season of a show through the Xbox Video Store or the PlayStation Store, in case it is not available on one of the streaming services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">THE BEAMERS A problem with the gaming devices is that they all take a couple of minutes to boot up. (And with all the video available, time is of the essence. After all, there are hours and hours of “Friday Night Lights” to watch.) That is not the case with a couple of other popular options, including Apple TV and Google’s Chromecast, that can also beam videos from a phone or laptop to the TV screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Why “beam”? You might start watching a YouTube video on your iPhone and decide that you want to show it to your family — in that case, you would click a button on a smartphone and stream it on the TV set. Or you might be curious about an interview streaming live on YouTube. You can find the live stream on a laptop and push it to the big screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">When it comes to Apple TV, probably the most powerful of the beaming devices, the name can be misleading. It is not a television set or a cable channel or a full-blown competitor to Netflix. Rather, it’s a sleek black box, shaped like a hockey puck, that connects to a TV set. Not surprisingly, given Apple’s penchant for design, Apple TV is probably the most attractive of all the Internet TV adapters on the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Apple promotes the device’s $99 price, but it is actually more expensive — you will need to buy an HDMI cable to connect the box to the back of your TV. And the device’s AirPlay beaming function works only with Apple phones, tablets and computers, so it’s not as appealing if you are not in the Apple family already.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Google’s $35 Chromecast, one of the newest ways to make TV sets smarter, looks like a flash drive and plugs into an HDMI port on your TV. Using your home Wi-Fi, it will project on the TV whatever you are watching on your mobile device or computer. Google Android, Apple and Microsoft Windows devices are all welcome here. But Chromecast does not come with video apps the way Apple TV or the video game consoles do, so it is entirely dependent on the second device that you are using to find TV episodes or films, which can make it feel too constricting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On the other end of this plug-in spectrum are boxes like the Roku, which can be found online for as little as $40, and the slightly more expensive WD TV Play from Western Digital. These boxes have apps galore, even for streaming services you’ve never heard of. But the Roku, the best known of this bunch, is just beginning to enable beaming from other screens.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/04/25/amazon-settop-box/2113353/" class="s1" target="_blank">There are surely more of these boxes to come — Amazon is said to </a><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/04/25/amazon-settop-box/2113353/" class="a" target="_blank">have </a>one in the works<span class="p">, for example.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">THE FUTURE Of course, there is still promise that the TV itself will become smart. Some TVs already have Wi-Fi and Internet apps built in, allowing viewers to pause Netflix with the same remote control used to turn up the volume. Increasingly, these TVs will negate the need for special adapters, but in the meantime, the adapters are the best window into the television revolution.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">After a short while with Netflix via Apple TV or YouTube via Xbox or Hulu via Chromecast, you might wonder why anyone pays for cable television anymore. All the evidence until now suggests that for most people Internet streams are a supplement to cable, not a replacement. The way things are going, viewers may subscribe to more packages of TV in the future, not fewer of them, because of the convenience and sense of control that comes along with each.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/business/media/google-is-said-to-mull-internet-cable-service.html?_r=0" class="s1" target="_blank">One thing is certain: strong winds of change are coming to TV. The streaming devices seem to be just the first step. Sony, Intel, </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/business/media/google-is-said-to-mull-internet-cable-service.html?_r=0" class="a" target="_blank">Google</a> <span style=" color: #000;">and other companies are interested in selling a cablelike package of channels via the Internet, challenging incumbents like Comcast and Time Warner Cable. Apple is taking a different tack, collaborating with those incumbents to make it easier for viewers to watch TV on their own terms.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">For now, then, it may be best to think of the streaming devices as Trojan horses for the technology giants that manufacture them. Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon all want a seat at the table in TV’s future. And these devices are a start.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">For now, it may be best to think of streaming devices as trojan horses for the technology giants that manufacture them: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and the like all want a seat at the table of the future of TV. | Julia Yellow</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document NYTFEED020130821e98m002e7</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_017.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark28">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark29">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Web Site Down?

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos’s purchase of The Washington Post raises the possibility that he acquired the paper as a trophy to celebrate his success as the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com. The acquisition comes after the purchase of The Boston Globe by John W. Henry, the owner of the Boston Red Sox and a trading firm billionaire. The purchases are part of a broader trend toward private ownership of media companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A classic economic study by Harold Demsetz and Kenneth Lehn finds that concentrated ownership might be explained by the “amenity potential” of certain companies, including mass media and sports teams. John Henry’s holdings nicely illustrate both. As the authors explain, winning the World Series or “believing that one is systematically influencing public opinion” may provide consumption benefits to the owners even if profits are diminished.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The study raises another possibility, however. Concentrated ownership works better in highly volatile environments, where rapid change and external forces make it difficult for public shareholders to monitor and judge the performance of managers. In such “high agency cost” environments, it may be more efficient for a single owner or a dominant shareholder to keep an eye on how managers are dealing with rapid change and disruptive innovation. “The noisier a firm’s environment, the greater the payoff to owners in maintaining tighter control,” the paper explains. “Hence, noisier environments should give rise to more concentrated ownership structures.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos has proven highly talented at managing in disruptive, innovative environments. Amazon is a publicly traded company, but Mr. Bezos remains the dominant shareholder, consistent with what the Demsetz and Lehn study predicts. Perhaps the right to control The Washington Post is worth more when Mr. Bezos owns the company. Not because it’s a trophy, or to save the world, but simply because an experienced and talented captain gets to steer the boat through the rough seas ahead.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1833178?uid=3739832&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102565217473" class="s1" target="_blank">The Demsetz and Lehn study, published in the Journal of Political Economy (1985), is available </a>here<span class="p">.</span></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/the-bank-behind-the-sale-of-the-washington-post-to-amazons-bezos/">Bank Behind Sale of Washington Post to Amazon’s Bezos</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/buffett%e2%80%99s-annual-letter-plays-up-newspapers%e2%80%99-value/" class="a" target="_blank">In His Annual Letter, Buffett Plays Up </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/buffett%e2%80%99s-annual-letter-plays-up-newspapers%e2%80%99-value/" target="_blank">Newspapers</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 124%;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos is the chief executive of Amazon.com. | Emmanuel Dunand/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Document NYTB000020130819e98j0030g</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_019.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark32">finance</a><a name="bookmark33">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Challenges are nothing new for Bezos; For buyer of Post, zeal for disruption is matched by desire to get it</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">right</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD AND CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">2,886 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">19 August 2013 International Herald Tribune INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">14</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Early employees of Amazon.com still remember the day the company took away their aspirin.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It was late 1999. After years of heady excess, the Internet boom was beginning to falter. Amazon, among the most celebrated of the dot-coms, was burdened with debt and spiraling losses. Jeffrey P. Bezos, its founder and chief impresario, had to impress Wall Street that he was serious about cutting costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But how? Amazon had never indulged employees with Silicon Valley perks like massages or sushi chefs. Just about the only thing that workers received free was aspirin. So the aspirin went.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The removal created a lot of muttering, but the cost-cutting — including layoffs — and promises of future profit helped Amazon escape the jaws of doom. And now, 14 years later, Mr. Bezos, 49, has become so rich and successful that he can surprise the world by buying The Washington Post for $250 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">No one, apparently including Mr. Bezos himself, seems to know what he intends to do with that fabled newspaper. This is, after all, a man who says the quality he most wanted in a wife was someone who would be best at springing him from a third-world prison. He can probably be counted on to think unpredictably.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The aspirin takeaway and similar incidents over the course of Mr. Bezos’ career show a determination to do whatever is necessary to succeed and a fanatic attention to detail, even at the expense of appearing ridiculous. Also, he does not care about your headache.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Jeff may be outwardly goofy, with that trademark laugh, but he’s a very tough guy,’’ said James Marcus, who was Amazon employee No. 55. ‘‘If he goes even halfway through with his much-vaunted reinvention of journalism, there is no way he’s not going to break some eggs.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos is the sole founder, the public face, the largest shareholder and the visionary of Amazon. ‘‘For many of us, creating earth’s biggest bookstore would have been enough,’’ said Kerry Fried, employee No. 251. ‘‘Jeff’s goal was a touch grander: to conquer the world.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos has more than his share of detractors — just ask your neighborhood bookseller, if you can find one. But it is increasingly hard to dispute that he is the natural heir of Steven P. Jobs as the entrepreneur with the most effect on the way people live now.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon, which is as much a reflection of Mr. Bezos’ personality as a corporation worth $125 billion can be, is by far the fastest-growing major retailer, although that simple label long ago ceased to suffice. It is also a movie studio, an art gallery(a 1962 Picasso, ‘‘Jacqueline au Chapeau Noir,’’ can be had for $175,000) and a publisher. It is an empire that spans much of the globe and even has its own currency, Amazon coins. What it does not have much of, and never did, are traditional profits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The company has all sorts of regulatory and competitive concerns, making for a minefield of possible conflicts of interest for The Post. Amazon has opposed states’ efforts to have e-commerce companies collect sales tax. It was the main beneficiary of the U.S. Justice Department’s successful pursuit of five publishers and Apple on antitrust grounds. It is locking horns with major companies like Wal-Mart Stores and I.B.M. And as it expands into same-day delivery of its products, it will come up against grocery chains and drugstores.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Through its thriving data storage division, Amazon is becoming an important contractor to the government bureaucracy that is a mainstay of The Post’s reporting. If persistent rumors are true and the company produces an Amazon phone, yet another set of antagonists will arise.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Other newspaper publishers have similar, if fewer, conflicts. The Washington Post Co. owned Kaplan, a for-profit education company that came under congressional scrutiny, and the company fought efforts to impose regulations. But the newspaper nonetheless maintained its commitment to investigative journalism. Some argue that it would to take more than Mr. Bezos to transform that culture.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Newsrooms are very conservative,’’ said Bill Buzenberg, executive director for the Center for Public Integrity. ‘‘They have difficulty changing, and certainly they have difficulty selling out their core principles.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Perhaps. But then, few newsrooms have ever been confronted with a new owner whose zeal for disruption is matched by his obsession with tinkering until he gets it right. As Steve Yegge, a former employee, once put it, ‘‘He just makes ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies.’’ A relevant fact: Mr. Bezos originally thought of naming Amazon ‘‘Relentless.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Marcus, now the executive editor of Harper’s Magazine, said it all made sense, kind of: ‘‘Bezos is fascinated by broken business models. And whatever else you think of newspapers, the business model is broken.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">There is a reason that not even the most imaginative media critics ever thought that Jeff Bezos might one day buy The Washington Post: he has never seemed a fan of journalism or journalists. He gives interviews only when he has something to promote, and always stays on message. He likes his privacy; there are no ‘‘at home with’’ magazine features with him lounging with his wife, MacKenzie, and four children at his luxurious Seattle estate.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s earnings calls are festivals of vagueness.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Even a number as basic, and presumably impressive, as how many Kindle e-readers the company sells is never released. There are no bold signs on its growing Seattle headquarters complex to identify what is contained within. And there are fewer leaks out of Amazon than from the National Security Agency.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The philanthropic Bill Gates, whose wife, Melinda, served on The Post’s board, might have been a more likely buyer. Mark Zuckerberg, who adopted Donald E. Graham, the Post Co.’s chief executive, as a mentor, could have been plausible. When it turned out to be Mr. Bezos instead, no one minded admitting astonishment. Neither his managerial style nor his entrepreneurial success nor his passion for secrecy seem to transfer over to his newest possession.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Every story you ever see about Amazon, it has that sentence: ‘An Amazon spokesman declined to comment,’’’ Mr. Marcus said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Though indisputably one of the great marvels of the age, Amazon is a curious beast that offers few obvious lessons for how a newspaper like The Post might become profitable. Financial writers have noted that Apple makes more than twice as much money in a quarter than Amazon earned during the entire last decade. Last quarter, Amazon had a net loss of $7 million. But Wall Street loves Amazon anyway.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One big reason is that Amazon tends to be lavish with its customers. It sells to them at a discount, will often ship free and, if a customer wants to return an item, will refund the money before even receiving the return.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Sometimes it will even do more. Say you buy a book, and then decide it is not for you. You tell Amazon you are returning it. You might get a message like this: ‘‘Keep this item and receive a refund! It’s on us!’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">That is a sure way to win friends and lose money. But Wall Street believes that the company will someday ‘‘monetize’’ tens of millions of customers — in other words, make a real profit each time it sells them something. Maybe next year. Or the year after. From the very beginning, Mr. Bezos has made Amazon an investment story about the company’s potential rather than its reality.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">People who have worked closely with Mr. Bezos say he refuses to waste time on anything that is not directly about the customer. ‘‘That’s where his ego is,’’ one former colleague said. As technology companies grow old and big, they strive to keep the energy and boldness of the start-ups they once were. They almost always fail.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon is the exception. ‘‘If a new product was launching, sometimes the day would never end,’’ a former employee said. As an Amazon joke has it, work-life balance is for people who do not like their work.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In Seattle, of course, the employees are well compensated with a stock that has risen 600 percent in the past five years. Out in the warehouses, where most of Amazon’s 90,000 employees work, starting pay is about $12 an hour and workers can quickly lose their jobs if they slow down.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It was so hot in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in May 2011 that some workers at the Amazon warehouse there collapsed. Another company with different attitudes might have installed air-conditioning, or simply sent workers home during heat spells. If Amazon did that, however, East Coast customers might not get their Jay-Z CDs or diapers or jars of heather honey as quickly as they expected.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">So the company chose a different solution. It arranged to station ambulances and paramedics out front during five days of excessive heat, according to The Morning Call, the Pennsylvania newspaper that broke the story. Fifteen workers were taken to area hospitals after they fell, and as many as 30 more were treated by paramedics at the warehouse. Workers quoted by the paper said the heat index in the facility, a measure that includes humidity, was as high as 114 degrees Fahrenheit (46 Celsius). Amazon declined to cooperate with the newspaper, even when it later installed air-conditioning.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is unlikely that Mr. Bezos will treat The Post’s reporters the way he treated his warehouse workers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘I don’t expect him to turn off the air-conditioning,’’ said Ken Doctor, an analyst at Outsell. But Mr. Doctor suggested that Mr. Bezos did have one particularly relevant area of expertise: gathering data and using it to figure out what consumers want. ‘‘The Washington Post has a major political news audience,’’ Mr. Doctor said. ‘‘Yet it hasn’t been able to segment that audience commercially.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One other competency that Mr. Bezos has: money, and lots of it.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘There’s not a person in this world that can save the newspaper industry,’’ said Craig Huber, an independent research analyst. ‘‘He’s going to be dealing with operating losses as far as the eye can see. I think The Washington Post sold to him because he’s going to be more willing to absorb those losses.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A core role for any newspaper is to cover the local government. For The Post, that includes the federal government. In recent years, however, Amazon has become a government contractor — in effect, the government’s digital filing cabinet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services, Mr. Bezos’s cloud computing operation, is the world’s largest service for third-party rental of computing and data storage. Besides hundreds of thousands of individuals and businesses, more than 2,000 research institutions and 500 government institutions worldwide use A.W.S. Amazon runs several large data centers, each containing of hundreds of thousands of servers, along with 42 smaller facilities around the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The operations of the data centers, like most other details about A.W.S., are a closely held secret. Even the company’s senior executives must have a valid reason to be inside one of the big facilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In addition to the eight major centers, A.W.S. operates a separate data center, called GovCloud, for the U.S. government. GovCloud is compliant with the government’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, controls. Only U.S. citizens can use the computers. Much other government work, for both the United States and foreign governments, is done in other A.W.S. centers as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In one important recent development, A.W.S. was awarded a contract valued at $600 million to provide computing services to the C.I.A. James Staten, an analyst with Forrester Research, said the C.I.A. contract was a breakthrough for Amazon. ‘‘Every other national intelligence service will want the same kind of computing, if they can get it,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Every other cloud services company, meanwhile, wants a piece of the action. I.B.M. formally protested the award on undisclosed grounds. The Government Accountability Office, while finding generally for Amazon, said the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">C.I.A. should re-examine the deal. Amazon is expected to officially apply for the original award to stand.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Although Mr. Bezos, not Amazon, bought The Post, his role as Amazon’s chief executive and biggest shareholder makes for awkward relationships. Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security Studies, said, ‘‘It’s a serious potential conflict of interest for a major newspaper like The Washington Post to have a contractual relationship with the government and the most secret part of the government.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But Steve Aftergood, director of the project on government secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, said that if The Washington Post did not publish a story about the C.I.A. because of Amazon’s business relationship with the agency, ‘‘there would be no shortage of other venues that would be eager to publish the information in question.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Bob Woodward, The Post’s most famous reporter, said he had first met Mr. Bezos at a conference in Colorado about a decade ago and that they had spoken ‘‘a number of times at those conferences and elsewhere.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Woodward said that when he discussed projects and books with Mr. Bezos, ‘‘he always struck me as very serious about it and in tune with the values of independence, aggressiveness.’’ He added that he hoped that because Mr. Bezos would run a company that was ‘‘customer-focused,’’ the entrepreneur would recognize how much readers appreciate high-quality reporting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Mr. Bezos has made the right noises. Referencing a famous assertion that John N. Mitchell, President Richard M. Nixon’s 1972 campaign director, directed at Katharine Graham, The Post’s publisher, the Amazon chief wrote in a letter to Post employees that ‘‘while I hope no one ever threatens to put one of my body parts through a wringer, if they do, thanks to Mrs. Graham’s example, I’ll be ready.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos’s critics, however, have been clamoring to put him through a wringer for years now. Leaving aside the complaints of bookstores, publishers and distributors, all groups whose viability he is challenging, two controversies seem to prefigure the sort of conflicts he will have as The Post’s new owner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">WikiLeaks briefly used Amazon Web Services in late 2010 to host its purloined classified documents, but then Amazon pulled the plug. The company said that contrary to news reports, it was not acting at the government’s request. Instead, it said it had taken WikiLeaks offline for violating Amazon’s rules against posting material you do not own. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said Amazon ‘‘ran away with its tail between its legs.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A more recent complaint involves the opposite of the WikiLeaks situation: a site that Amazon is declining to shut down. Ask.fm, a Web site for anonymous teenagers, is being blamed in the British media for allowing cyberbullying in the suicides of four youths. Amazon, which reportedly hosts Ask.fm, has been asked to take it down for violating its rules against hate speech. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Largely overlooked in the commentary over what Mr. Bezos will do with The Post is the fact that he has already commanded a large editorial team.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the early days of Amazon, he set up a department to produce reviews of the books that Amazon was selling. It was an impressive gesture: Whoever heard of a store with editors? But it offered Amazon instant credibility. Mr. Bezos never suggested that the reviews be positive, and he gave the department his full support.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Until he did not. People at Amazon at the time describe a struggle between the high-minded humans and the data-driven Vulcans, otherwise known as masters of business administration. The Vulcans said that few customers actually read the reviews, so maybe Amazon should not spend so much to produce them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘It was a culture war, and the Vulcans won,’’ said Tim Appelo, who worked in the editorial department. ‘‘Many people in Amazon editorial were embittered because Bezos scuttled us.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The professional reviews yielded to the innovation of customer reviews — sometimes an impartial evaluation, sometimes a love song by the author’s mother disguised as an impartial evaluation. There was no way to tell, and no one in management seemed to care. Many of the reviewers quit or were laid off.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Mr. Appelo was not bitter. In fact, he went back to Amazon for a second stint, introducing its digital video store in 2006. (He is now at The Hollywood Reporter.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Bezos knows that there is a difference between the marketplace and the marketplace for ideas,’’ Mr. Appelo said. ‘‘Bezos is relentlessly and ruthlessly inventive, but I don’t think he’ll indulge his Vulcan side too much.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Put like that, it sounds somewhere between a gut feeling and a heartfelt wish. In these troubled times for newspapers, that may be the most they can expect.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document INHT000020130818e98j0000k</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_020.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark34">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark35">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos: A Brief Anthology</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">691 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">17 August 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

Rowen, a senior Internet analyst at Prudential Securities, but “if Amazon is going to justify its market capitalization, it is going to have to show that other categories are viable on the Internet. So far, they have not shown that sales of other merchandise can grow rapidly and be profitable.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2005</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/business/yourmoney/10amazon.html" class="s1" target="_blank">A decade into its operations, Amazon had already upended the bookselling industry. But as it diversified into a retailer of all manner of products, the reporter Gary Rivlin wrote, some worried that the company </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/business/yourmoney/10amazon.html" class="a" target="_blank">was spreading</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/business/yourmoney/10amazon.html" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/business/yourmoney/10amazon.html" class="a" target="_blank">itself too thin</a>. And there were concerns, he said, about “a chronic Amazon sticking point: profitability.” The editor of an industry newsletter even questioned Mr. Bezos’s suitability as chief executive. “The question that needs to be asked,” he said, “is how many years of declining stock performance will a board tolerate before they finally say, ‘Listen, we need to make a change.’”</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2011</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/business/at-amazon-jeff-bezos-talks-long-term-and-means-it.html" class="s1" target="_blank">As the stock market bounced back after the depths of the financial crisis, Amazon shares began their own steep climb.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It has now been more than a week since Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, announced that he was buying The Washington Post in what could be the most exciting case of convergence between new media and old since the merger of AOL with Time Warner. But how might Mr. Bezos change this venerable flagship of U.S. journalism? And what could his ownership of The Post mean for news businesses around the world?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">These may seem strange questions for a column devoted mostly to controversies in public policy and economics, but newspapers today are a declining industry, comparable to the steel and shipbuilding industries in the 1980s.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Public discussion often assumes that journalism is technologically doomed. The Internet, it seems, is ineluctably turning news and analysis from an industry that employs many into an unpaid hobby for philanthropists or</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">self-promoters who earn their livings by other means.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From an economic standpoint, this fatalism is unjustified.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">If high-quality news and analysis have significant value to customers, then the people providing these services will eventually find ways to get paid. It is often claimed that the news has become worthless because Internet distribution involves zero marginal cost, but this is poor economics. The true cost of news lies not in distribution, but in the research, composition, selection and editing required for good writing. These costs are as high as ever today.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The real challenge to newspapers, therefore, is not the idealistic Internet cliché that ‘‘information wants to be free.’’ It is the failure of traditional media companies to devise business models that turn the new distribution technology to their advantage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Historically, such failure is not surprising. Just as the railroad companies failed to adapt to cars and competed themselves into bankruptcy, traditional media moguls have proved clueless in harnessing the Internet. This is why the news businesses must look for salvation to managers like Mr. Bezos, who treat the Internet neither as a curse nor as a libertarian utopia, but rather as a very efficient mechanism for getting consumers to spend money.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">So far, Mr. Bezos has said little about his plans for The Post. The few hints he offered in an open letter to editorial staff had the familiar naïveté of the news proprietor who thinks he can reinvent journalism: ‘‘Our touchstone will be readers, understanding what they care about — government, local leaders, restaurant openings, scout troops, businesses, charities, governors, sports — and working backwards from there.’’ As if that were not what newspapers have always done.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The question Mr. Bezos ought to be asking is not how to reinvent journalism, but how to make journalism pay in the Internet world. The business model, not the content, is where Mr. Bezos needs to apply his formidable business acumen and intellectual powers. If he does this, he will surely come up with the obvious answer: If you want to make a profit from selling news, you must charge consumers its cost of production plus a profit margin.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Traditional U.S. media executives fail to understand this elementary business principle because newspaper costs there have traditionally been subsidized by advertising.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The essential economic problem of the news business is that on the Internet, this subsidy disappears, because search-based classified advertising is infinitely more effective than display ads that push unsolicited messages at</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">readers, whether in print papers or on news Web sites. The survival of the news media, therefore, will depend on charging consumers directly for what they read.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Unfortunately as they start to do this, traditional media companies are again stampeding in the wrong direction: toward a sole focus on subscriptions that demand annual payments from regular readers. This subscription model is almost as inimical to the Internet as the advertising model, since it tries to recreate the traditional local newspaper model of serving relatively small numbers of ‘‘loyal’’ readers, instead of the millions or even billions of casual users who can be reached via the Net.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Much Internet reading will always be casual rather than loyal, as nobody will buy annual subscriptions for more than a few Web sites — perhaps a local paper, plus a global source like The New York Times, plus a weekly magazine. Yet thousands of sites will occasionally feature items of interest to millions of readers, who could be turned into profitable customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">If, say, 20 million occasional readers spend as little as $1 a year on a Web site, this will create twice as much revenue as 100,000 subscribers paying $100 each. The business objective must surely be to secure both revenue streams — and this is where Amazon’s success in managing large numbers of small transactions could come in.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As co-founder of thebrowser.com, a Web site that aggregates high-quality writing and experiments with payment systems, I am all too aware that conventional wisdom views micropayments as doomed to failure. According to most Internet gurus, readers will always demand free content and find it in abundance. But this consensus is being disproved by events. More and more newspapers are erecting pay walls and demanding subscriptions, eliminating free content. Meanwhile, consumer resistance to Internet payments is disappearing as traffic moves to mobile devices, where data downloads are far from free.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The confluence of these two trends creates the right environment for Web sites to levy micropayments for high-quality online content. With consumers now paying hundreds of dollars annually for Internet downloads,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">newspapers are crazy to cede all this revenue to telecommunications companies while offering their content free to nonsubscribers or completely locking them out.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">What newspapers need are easy, frictionless mechanisms for charging their casual readers small amounts.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">For years, independent bookstores in the United States have taken creative steps to fight off challenges from Amazon.com and the superstores by building in-house espresso bars, offering members-only lunches with authors and selling birthday cards, toys and trinkets.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2013, it has come to this: Asking their customers for donations.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Crowdfunding is sweeping through the bookstore business, the latest tactic for survival in a market that is dominated by Amazon, with its rock-bottom prices, and Barnes &amp; Noble, with its dizzying in-store selection. It is hardly a sustainable business model, but it buys some time and gives customers a feeling of helping a favorite cause and even preserving a civic treasure.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In San Francisco, a campaign for Adobe Books successfully raised $60,000 on Indiegogo.com in March after the store faced a rent increase and nearly went out of business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In Asheville, North Carolina, the Spellbound Children’s Bookshop collected more than $5,000 when it appealed to customers for help in moving to a new location.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In New York, Books of Wonder raised more than $50,000 in an online campaign last autumn after the recession and various losses depleted its resources.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Web sites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, originally made for the public financing of creative projects, have simplified the logistics of raising money, and bookstores facing financial distress are seizing the opportunity. A store can set up a Web page explaining what its fund-raising goal is, why it is asking for money and what the deadline is. Donors pitch in as little as $5 or $10 with a few clicks and a credit card number.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Peter Glassman, who owns Books of Wonder, said he had turned to a fund-raising campaign only as a last resort.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘I thought, given the financial strains we’re under at the moment, perhaps this is the way to prevent us from getting into a really desperate situation,’’ Mr. Glassman said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">He said it was the first time in 30 years that he had been willing to admit that the store needed help. ‘‘You never tell people your problems,’’ he said. ‘‘The worst you say is, ‘Business is a little tight.’’’</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But that kind of tough-it-out attitude seems to have gone the way of the Book-of-the-Month Club. The independent bookstores that remain have taken a hard-nosed approach to their business, more willing to experiment with new technologies and to tap the carefully cultivated loyalty of their customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Josh Mills, the longtime manager of The Bookstore in Chico, California, made a public appeal for $35,000 on Indiegogo when the owner decided to close the store and Mr. Mills stepped up to buy it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In less than two months, he and his wife, Muir Hughes, had collected $36,068, mostly in chunks of $15 and $25 from locals who were outraged at the thought of the bookstore’s shutting down. Donations seemed to come from everywhere: Mr. Mills received $25 from one former customer in Hawaii who had heard about the store’s plight via e-mail from a friend in France. Acquaintances threw local fund-raisers, serving wine, crostini and deviled eggs, and then funneled the money into the online campaign.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘I felt strange about asking for money that way — baring my soul and sharing my personal business is not what I do,’’ said Mr. Mills, who now owns the store. ‘‘Bookstores are sort of an endangered industry for lots of reasons. But it would have left a huge hole in our little community if we had gone away.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Independents’ business has suffered in recent years for all of the usual reasons. Many customers have shifted their purchases from print books to e-books. Amazon’s market share keeps growing, making it the biggest seller of books in the country. And the price of rent has gone up in city centers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A price war between Amazon and Overstock.com, another online retailer, that flared up last month resulted in a discounting of print books even more steeply than usual, sometimes close to 60 percent — a price cut that a small bookstore cannot match. (Amazon and Overstock can make up for their losses on books by selling jewelry, furniture and diapers.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">But owners of independent bookstores also reason that if they cannot compete with Amazon on price, they will attract customers by having a more carefully chosen selection. If Barnes &amp; Noble has uninformed salesclerks, theirs will have the fluency of a doctorate candidate in literature.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">If their customers have a fierce attachment to their local neighborhood bookstore, as many claim to do, then bookstore owners say that they should test that loyalty by making a direct appeal for donations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘I think it’s an indication of the emotional connection that many customers have with their bookstores,’’ said Daniel Goldin, the owner of the Boswell Book Company in Milwaukee. ‘‘Every customer who buys a book at an independent could do it in a different way, a cheaper way. A lot of customers position us in their head like the nonprofits they support, like a humane society or a park.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The American Booksellers Association, a trade group, says the number of bookstores it represents has grown slightly in the past several years, despite an overall drop in the past decade — it has 1,632 members, down from about 2,400 members in 2002.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">‘‘Amazon obviously continues to grow,’’ said Oren Teicher, the chief executive of the association. ‘‘It’s not like we’re without challenges.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Seeking financial support from customers, he said, is an example ‘‘of how a combination of technology and localism is helping stores get funded that 20 years ago would have been impossible to do.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">Many independent bookstores said that despite the challenges to their business, they were doing just fine. Some of them are crowdfunding not as a means of survival, but as a way to expand.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">BookCourt, a fixture in the Cobble Hill neighborhood in the Brooklyn borough of New York, has been thriving despite competition from Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble — a two-story Barnes &amp; Noble is just three blocks away. It recently started an ambitious online campaign to help pay for the purchase of a new bookstore space in the Catskill Mountains that will open next spring.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Zack Zook, the events and development director for the store, said he had been inspired by online fund-raising campaigns for short films and art projects that he had occasionally participated in for the past several years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">‘‘There’s something that feels really neutral about throwing a hundred bucks in a pot,’’ Mr. Zook said. ‘‘People like to be affiliated with a mission. And with any independent bookstore, it’s almost like a nonprofit — there’s really no money to play with.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Mr. Glassman, of Books of Wonder, said he had been gratified by the support. ‘‘It was very touching to know how much people care,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">He acknowledged the fund-raising campaign was a short-term fix. ‘‘It helped, but it didn’t solve it,’’ he said. ‘‘But we’re not in danger anymore of closing tomorrow.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document INHT000020130812e98d0003d</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_024.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark42">Q&amp;A</a><a name="bookmark43">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Technology; Personal Tech</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Locating a Missing Amazon Order</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By J.

Facebook allows group conversations among two or more members, which can be useful for planning events and gatherings. If you do not wish to be included or receive notifications about a particular group message, you can unsubscribe from it. The other participants will be notified that you have left the conversation, however, so you cannot really sneak out.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">To be on your way, log into Facebook, click the Messages icon at the top of the page and select the conversation you wish to leave. Click the Actions menu at the top and select Leave Conversation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The same Actions menu also includes a Mute Conversation command.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Last month the Justice Department won an antitrust suit against Apple, convincing Judge Denise Cote of United States District Court that the company had colluded with five major publishers to fix e-book prices. At a hearing on Friday, the department will argue that its plan to remedy Apple&#39;s misconduct will &#39;&#39;restore lost competition.&#39;&#39; In a narrow sense it may, but the problem with this case all along was that the department ignored the potentially bigger anticompetitive force in the e-book market -- Amazon -- while focusing on Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Apple&#39;s wrongdoing dates back to 2010, when it introduced an &#39;&#39;agency model&#39;&#39; in which publishers set retail prices and Apple took a commission. The company also specified in its contracts that if a rival set lower prices than those in the iBookstore, the publishers would have to match them. After these deals, e-book prices went up. The Justice Department charged Apple with illegally conspiring to fix prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As reparation, the Justice Department wants Apple to terminate its contracts with the five publishers. The government also wants to ban Apple from signing agreements with suppliers of e-books, music, movies and television shows that are likely to increase the prices at which rivals sell that content. It wants the company to pay for a court-appointed monitor to ensure compliance with antitrust law, and allow other retailers (like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble) to sell e-books from their iPad and iPhone apps for a two-year period, without paying Apple a commission on those sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">What&#39;s in this for consumers? E-book prices, which spiked in 2010, dropped back down in 2012, after publishers started settling with the government. The proposed remedies should prevent future price-fixing and make it easier for readers to make purchases through apps.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mainly, the Justice Department&#39;s plan will keep Apple from getting back to its old tricks. It does not address the need for a counterweight to Amazon&#39;s dominance. Amazon controls an estimated 65 percent of the market, with Apple at 10 percent and other retailers splitting the rest. (Before Apple started selling e-books, Amazon had 90 percent.) The case against Apple has done nothing to solve that problem.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020130809e98900050</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_026.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark46">ARTSBEAT</a><a name="bookmark47">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">At Amazon Art Site, Everyone&#39;s a Critic</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By PATRICIA COHEN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">330 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">8 August 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

Bezos is buying The Washington Post — was not even 24 hours old when shock and wisecracks about the unexpected $250 million deal began to give way to acceptance and even envy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">What, many are asking, does Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, see in a 135-year-old newspaper that others do not?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">If his business history is any indication, do not expect a quick answer and do not expect any short-term fixes for The Post, which has suffered from years of sliding revenue and circulation. While terms like disrupter and innovator are often used to describe Mr. Bezos in his years at Amazon, he has also proved to be a long-term thinker, someone willing to buck Wall Street demands for big profits in order to invest in his company’s growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Now that he is the private owner of The Post, it would not be surprising to see him worry little about turning a quick profit and instead push to upend the often ossified world of newspaper publishing, just as he did with books more than a decade ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Indeed, Mr. Bezos, who declined a request for an interview, hinted in a letter to employees that he felt a ‘‘need to invent, which means we will need to experiment,’’ and that ‘‘there will, of course, be change at The Post over the coming years.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But just what those experiments will be is anyone’s guess.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Jeff Bezos doesn’t need The Washington Post to make money tomorrow or even in five years,’’ said Glenn Kelman, the founder and chief executive of Redfin, a real estate site that, like Amazon, is based in Seattle. ‘‘He’s proven that he’s able to think over a geological time scale.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In recent years, newspapers large and small have experimented with concepts aimed at capturing elusive online revenue to make up for losses in print circulation and advertising. The Post, for example, has dabbled in some experimental news products, including the creation of a social reader for Facebook and a recommendation engine called Trove.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Other news organizations have toyed with various strategies, most with limited success. The Daily, an iPad-only news app developed by News Corp., was closed after less than two years. The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, The New York Times and The Post have adopted various pay models for digital readers. The Guardian started a U.S.-based operation in 2011 to experiment with a digitally focused newsroom.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">All of these companies have created mobile apps and made significant investments in online video, where advertising revenue is expected to grow, but no paper has cracked the code on how to replace the steep declines in print advertising. Other traditional print magazines, like The New Yorker and Vogue, have digitized and sold portions of their archives.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">They have also dabbled with new ways to make money through Amazon, particularly through the Kindle Singles, which are shorter e-books. Amazon’s biggest influence has been disrupting the economics of newspapers through millions of its Kindle mobile devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Mr. Bezos said The Post would be run separately from Amazon, but there is little doubt that he will bring what he has learned over the years to the newspaper world.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘He’s done an amazing job of bringing e-books to reality,’’ said Matt Galligan, the co-founder of the mobile news start-up Circa. ‘‘There’s a strong likelihood that a similar transition could happen at The Post.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Though Mr. Bezos demurely noted in his letter that he had no history in newspapers, the fact that he is an outsider not steeped in the old ways of newspaper management has excited some.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Washington Post to be sold to Jeff Bezos?! I’d actually return to the journalism world if I could work for him,’’ wrote Adrian Holovaty on Twitter after the news broke.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Six years ago, Mr. Holovaty held the title ‘‘editor for editorial innovation’’ at The Post, but he left in 2007. The co-creator of the popular Web framework Django, he thinks Mr. Bezos will bring ‘‘fresh, baggage-less thinking.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">No baggage — and deep pockets — means room to try new things. Might Mr. Bezos apply technology industry concepts like frictionless payments, e-commerce integration, recommendation engines, data analytics or improved concepts for mobile reading?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One of the biggest challenges for any company trying to sell goods on the Web, whether it is a crop-top shirt or a news subscription, is ‘‘creating relevance,’’ said Deena Varshavskaya, the founder and chief executive of Wanelo, an e-commerce site popular with women.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">That is an area where Mr. Bezos might be primed to flex his expertise in analyzing data to find ways to engage a younger audience. In addition, his money could come in handy when it comes to adding to the newspaper developers, engineers, designers and others who could radically change the way the organization looks and runs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The tech industry from which Mr. Bezos has emerged certainly has offered new ways to consume news. Start-ups like Flipboard, Digg, Pocket and Feedly have long been testing and building out alternative ways to read and consume information on the Web and via mobile devices. That includes experimenting with news aggregation, recommendations and clever ways to bookmark interesting articles to read later.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">James M. Brady, who was the executive editor of The Post’s Web site from 2004 to 2008, said that traditional news outlets had struggled to build and experiment with the digital arms of their organizations while retaining the values that built the company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘We all tried to do it on the news side, but when you’re dealing with declining revenues and still trying to put out a daily news product, there’s not much money left for the developer side,’’ he said. ‘‘We should have done it anyway, but at the time we were trying to preserve the core product, the daily newspaper.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In other words, the new ownership is an opportunity for a tech-oriented reboot.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Mr. Kelman of Redfin said that the steady flow of new ideas and the consumer reach of sites like Yahoo, Google, Facebook and Twitter meant that technology had a lot to say about the future of The Post and other newspapers. That a tech mogul is now also a newspaper mogul should not be a shock.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">‘‘It used to be that in Silicon Valley we just built the platforms and someone else wrote the content,’’ he said. ‘‘But that is changing. The lines have been blurred for a long time and this is just another step in that process.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document INHT000020130807e9880003o</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_029.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark52">ARTSBEAT</a><a name="bookmark53">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Returns to Art</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By PATRICIA COHEN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">270 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">7 August 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 2</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A day after the news that Amazon&#39;s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is buying The Washington Post, his company officially entered another cultural arena: art. On Tuesday, the online retailer announced the start of Amazon Art, where customers can buy original and limited-edition art from more than 150 dealers and 4,500 artists, ranging in price from a $10 screen print by the up-and-comer Ryan Humphrey to a $4.85 million painting by Norman Rockwell.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon, which worked with Sotheby&#39;s for a short-lived experiment selling art on the Web in 1999, will now vie with other, more established competitors in the online marketplace, including Artsy and Artnet. Amazon has sought to blunt some of that competitive pressure by partnering with Paddle8, an online auction site, among other players.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Amazon Art gives galleries a way to bring their passion and expertise about the artists they represent to our millions of customers,&#39;&#39; said Peter Faricy, the company&#39;s vice president for the Amazon Marketplace.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Erik Fairleigh, an Amazon spokesman, said that the commission scale is similar to what other sellers that use Amazon pay: between 5 and 20 percent, depending on the price of the artwork. Amazon is not providing an ironclad guarantee of authenticity, but Mr. Fairleigh said that the company is &#39;&#39;working with prestigious galleries and dealers&#39;&#39; to ensure quality and would investigate any potential problems and &#39;&#39;take appropriate action.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

They had lots of morale-boosting mottos but a volatile stock price. (When de Jonge expressed skepticism about the company, one Amazon executive told him, “I can tell you’re not a believer.”) De Jonge imagined that being employed there must have been “a little like living in Pompeii 2,000 years ago.”</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But apparently all those years of not-profit-making paid off.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">We went back to de Jonge’s article looking for any insights into the character who will be taking over one of the country’s best-known newspapers. This passage seemed germane. (The “investment” Bezos is referring to was Amazon’s acquisition of Drugstore.com.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Bezos declined to say if he has investments in other e-commerce companies, but says, “We may do more investments like this.” It’s this kind of almost routine doubling down every few months of his already massive bet and nervy expansion of the scale of his ambitions that keeps the public and Wall Street on the edge of their seats, makes Bezos a moving target to his rivals and buys him more time to turn a profit. And as he encourages us to imbue his company with the same limitless potential that as a rule we only vouchsafe for ourselves, we have to keep revising upward and outward our best guess of just what Bezos is really after. Does he want to be the reincarnation of Sam Walton? Does he want to be Michael Eisner? . . .</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Bezos, who once told his younger brother that he “refuses to evaluate either-or equations,” most likely wants to be all of these and then some. Indeed, his every gesture, posture and feature, from his standard-issue wardrobe of khakis and brown rubber-soled shoes to his homemade desk fashioned out of a door, seems calculated to belie the incendiary fact that Bezos is one of the world’s most ascendant capitalists, with apparently boundless ambitions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Today de Jonge says he recalls being “very impressed by the guy.” After writing the article, he wanted to buy stock in Amazon. “Of course,” he says, he “never got around to it.”</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/lets-help-michele-bachmann/" class="a" target="_blank">Let’s Help Michele </a><a href="http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/lets-help-michele-bachmann/" target="_blank">Bachmann</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/stock-advice-for-these-uncertain-times/">Stock Advice for These Uncertain Times</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/my-legal-editors-dream/">My (Legal) Editor’s Dream</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 124%;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos in 1998. | Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times Document NYTB000020130807e987001up</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_032.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark58">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark59">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Daily Report: For Washington Post, a Promise of Innovation</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">347 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">7 August 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

While terms like disrupter and innovator are often used to describe Mr. Bezos in his years at Amazon, he has also proved to be a long-term thinker, someone willing to buck Wall Street demands for big profits in order to invest in his company’s growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Now that he is the private owner of The Post, it would not be surprising to see him worry little about turning a quick profit and instead push to upend the often ossified world of newspaper publishing, just as he did with books more than a decade ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Indeed, Mr. Bezos, who declined a request for an interview, hinted in a letter to employees that he felt a “need to invent, which means we will need to experiment,” and that “there will, of course, be change at The Post over the coming years.”</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But just what those experiments will be is anyone’s guess.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“Jeff Bezos doesn’t need The Washington Post to make money tomorrow or even in five years,” said Glenn Kelman, the founder and chief executive of Redfin, a real estate site that, like Amazon, is based in Seattle. “He’s proven that he’s able to think over a geological time scale.”</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/daily-report-tech-mogul-in-deal-for-a-landmark-in-the-capital/">Daily Report: Tech Mogul in Deal for a Landmark in the Capital</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/the-tech-sectors-mixed-response-to-bezoss-purchase-of-the-post/" class="a" target="_blank">Tech Sector Responds to Bezos Deal for The </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/the-tech-sectors-mixed-response-to-bezoss-purchase-of-the-post/" target="_blank">Post</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/the-new-news-junkie-is-online-and-on-the-phone/" class="a" target="_blank">The New News Junkie Is Online and On the </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/the-new-news-junkie-is-online-and-on-the-phone/" target="_blank">Phone</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/when-it-comes-to-content-amazons-kindle-wont-be-undersold/">When It Comes to Content, Amazon’s Kindle Won’t Be Undersold</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">Bezos’s Shout-Out for His Cloud Service<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020130807e987000ul</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_033.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark60">finance</a><a name="bookmark61">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon chief’s new Capitol megaphone; Deal for Washington Post builds bridge between technology</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and politics</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By NICK WINGFIELD and DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">1,284 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">7 August 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">International Herald Tribune INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">17</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Washington of Jeffrey P. Bezos has been the state on the West Coast, a place of disruptive technology, fleece jackets and software engineers. He has shown little interest in the city on the East Coast, the Washington of politics, power suits and Woodward and Bernstein.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet now, from his tech frontier in Seattle, Mr. Bezos has bridged those worlds by buying The Washington Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The purchase price of $250 million is a pittance for a man who ranked 19th on Forbes magazine’s list of billionaires, with an estimated fortune of more than $25 billion. But the deal was still an astonishing move for a magnate who has kept a low profile in politics and has said almost nothing about his interest in newspapers, except that he reads them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Nonetheless, Mr. Bezos will now have a megaphone in the capital as powerful as anyone’s except in the White House. In keeping with many of his tech industry peers, he brings with him a libertarian bent, having supported gay marriage in Washington State and fought higher income taxes on wealthy people.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Of the businesspeople I know, he and Bill Gates are the two most intellectually curious people I know,’’ said Rob Glaser, the founder of another Seattle technology company, RealNetworks, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s. ‘‘It doesn’t surprise me that Jeff would find something with the intellectual depth of The Post an intriguing, compelling thing to be involved with.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos, 49, said in a statement on Monday that he would leave the day-to-day operations at The Washington Post to others. But his history — rising quickly as a Wall Street whiz, then starting Amazon.com out of a garage and building it into a retailing giant — is chock-full of cold calculations to improve his company’s fortunes. Many of his decisions have panned out, as Amazon has muscled its way into nearly every corner of retailing, leaving many competitors chafing in his wake.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The purchase of The Washington Post fits into one of the more eclectic — some might say, eccentric — patterns of investing and charitable giving of today’s billionaires. On top of the usual ream of stakes in technology start-ups like Uber and Twitter, Mr. Bezos has indulged his passion for outer space by financing the recovery from the seabed of an Apollo rocket that carried the first humans to the moon. He is paying for the creation of a clock buried in a mountain in West Texas that will tick once a year for the next 10,000 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">And now, Mr. Bezos — a man known for being an unsentimental business executive — has invested squarely in a sentimental business steeped in tradition. Of course, the deal for The Washington Post could feed his demonstrated appetite for reinventing venerable industries, from retailing to book publishing. Amazon’s Kindle business has turned Mr. Bezos from a merchant into a media mogul, as celebrated in some circles as another digital disrupter, Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s former chief executive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos and Donald E. Graham, chief executive of The Washington Post Co., have longstanding connections that may have helped the discussions. As an article on The Post’s Web site noted, Mr. Graham gave the Amazon chief advice on how to promote newspapers on the Kindle device. And Amazon is an investor in LivingSocial, an e-commerce venture led by Tim O’Shaughnessy, Mr. Graham’s son-in-law.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos has provided few clues about what changes might be in store. In an interview last year, though, he stated that he did not think people reading the Web would pay for a newspaper subscription because they were too trained to get it free. The Washington Post started an online subscription plan this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">He said in the same interview that there would be no printed newspapers in 20 years. The Washington Post had more than 457,000 subscribers to its daily print issue in the first quarter of this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">This year, Mr. Bezos was one of a group that put $5 million into Business Insider, a news site founded by Henry Blodget. Mr. Blodget rose to fame as a Wall Street analyst in the late 1990s with a wild forecast for Amazon’s shares that came true.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Drew Herdener, a spokesman for Amazon, who works with the Amazon chief on his personal initiatives, said Mr. Bezos was not available for an interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As Amazon has grown, so too has the volume of criticism of the company. It controls at least a quarter of the book business, more than any company in the past. Critics say that concentration is unhealthy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos’ disinclination to collect sales tax led him to investigate setting up Amazon on an Indian reservation. The company stoutly resisted efforts in many states over the years to get it to collect the taxes, saying it preferred a national solution. A tax reform measure mandating the collection of taxes by Internet companies has passed the Senate but is stalled in the House of Representatives.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Critics of Amazon were aghast at the news of the purchase, saying it would further increase the power of a company and a tycoon they think already have too much of it. Although Mr. Bezos and not Amazon bought The Post, rivals and critics were already concerned that the newspaper’s work would be used to help Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘It’s an old, boring story — rich man buys a newspaper — but in this instance it’s one of the richest men ever buying one of the most important newspapers ever, which is the one our government leaders read first thing every morning,’’ said Dennis Johnson, the co-founder of Melville House, a well-regarded small publisher. ‘‘This is the capper in the development of one of the most powerful vertical monopolies in our history, which is also one of the most controlling in matters of cultural concern.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos was a tinkerer from an early age. After Princeton University in New Jersey, he went to Wall Street, ending up at D.E. Shaw &amp; Co., a hedge fund.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">He began Amazon when he took note of two things: how fast the Internet was growing as it became a consumer medium in the early 1990s, and how well-suited the book business was to selling online. One Web site could offer all the hundreds of thousands of titles in print in a way that a land-based store never could.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As Amazon grew big, Mr. Bezos largely shunned the media spotlight. He has mostly shunned the political spotlight as well. His political contributions have gone mostly to Amazon’s corporate PAC, which divides its campaign checks relatively evenly between Democratic and Republican candidates. The stepson of a Cuban immigrant, Mr. Bezos has stayed out of the immigration debate that has attracted so many luminaries from the technology business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Last year, Mr. Bezos and his wife made waves with a $2.5 million contribution to the successful campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington State. He was one of the biggest donors in 2010 to another winning effort to defeat a proposed income tax on the wealthy in Washington State. People who know Mr. Bezos describe his political views as libertarian, with a small ‘‘l.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On Monday, Mr. Bezos told Washington Post employees that he did not intend to leave his full-time Amazon duties, or to relocate.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">‘‘I am happily living in ‘the other Washington’ where I have a day job that I love,’’ he wrote.

But across the Atlantic — nein, non, no.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Even as President Barack Obama spoke about middle-class jobs last week at an Amazon warehouse in Tennessee, Amazon was facing strikes at warehouses in Germany, its second-biggest market. Unions there say the company has imported American-style business practices — in particular, an antipathy toward organized labor — that stand at odds with European norms.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘In Germany, the idea that warehouse workers are going to be getting opposition from an employer when it comes to the right to organize, that’s virtually unheard-of,’’ said Marcus Courtney, a technology and communications department head at Uni Global Union, a federation of trade unions based in Nyon, Switzerland. ‘‘It puts Amazon out in left field.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon is hardly out there alone, however. Large American technology companies are increasingly running into obstacles as they expand in Europe. For Facebook and Google, the running issue is privacy. Google was fined this year by the German authorities for illegally collecting personal data while creating its Street View mapping service, after facing minimal sanctions over Street View at home. Meanwhile, European privacy regulators are considering tough regulations to protect consumers on the Internet, a direct challenge to Google, Facebook and other online companies that mine personal data.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Antitrust officials in Europe are scrutinizing Apple’s relationships with wireless carriers, as well as Google’s competitive practices. And Google, Apple and Amazon have all been criticized by European lawmakers for tactics that help them minimize their tax bills.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon has been criticized for its working conditions in the United States, but not nearly to the same extent as in Europe. On the surface, Amazon’s labor problems in Germany revolve around wages.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The union says workers in warehouses in two small German cities are properly classified as retail employees and should be paid at the higher rate required for people who work in department stores and other retail outlets.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Amazon says they are more properly classified as warehouse workers, and paid at a lower rate.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The subtext, though, is Amazon’s opposition to unions in its warehouses as a general principle, because the company fears unions will slow down the kind of behind-the-scenes innovation that has propelled its growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Dave Clark, the company’s vice president of worldwide operations and customer service, says Amazon views unions as intermediaries that will want to have a say on issues as varied as employee scheduling and the handling and packaging of orders. Amazon prizes its ability to introduce changes in such areas into its warehouses quickly to improve the experience of its customers, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Last year, the company spent $775 million to buy a manufacturer of robots that it plans eventually to deploy in its warehouses, though it has not said when they would come to Germany. The last thing it wants is to have to get approval from unions for such changes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘This really isn’t about higher wages,’’ Mr. Clark said. ‘‘It isn’t a cost question for us. It’s about what our relationship is with our people.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘We’re still a developing industry,’’ he added — despite the fact that Amazon posted revenue of $15.7 billion in the past quarter and the company is enjoying a buoyant stock price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the United States, Amazon has successfully thwarted efforts to unionize. More than a decade ago, Mr. Courtney of Uni Global led an unsuccessful effort in the company’s home state of Washington to organize Amazon’s customer service representatives.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Two years ago, an investigative article by The Morning Call newspaper in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley chronicled poor working conditions in an Amazon warehouse in the state, including instances in which it had stationed paramedics outside to take heat-stressed workers to the emergency room. Amazon says it has addressed the problem by installing air-conditioning in all of its facilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">More recently, a firm that provides temporary employees for Amazon warehouses is defending itself in a class-action suit that claims the firm shortchanged workers on pay as they waited in security lines to leave warehouses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Jonathan Barnes, a spokesman for the staffing firm named in the suit, Integrity Staffing Solutions, declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But it is a different story in Germany, where the powerful labor movement behind the Amazon strikes traces its roots for more than two centuries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Courtney, the Swiss-based head of the federation of trade unions, said other American technology giants, including I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard, have been more tolerant than Amazon of unions in their European operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">And the strikes in Germany raise especially knotty problems for the company, which has ambitious expansion plans there.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Germany is Amazon’s second-biggest market after North America, accounting for $8.73 billion, or 14 percent, of total company revenue in 2012. Even as workers in Bad Hersfeld and Leipzig began their recent strikes, Amazon announced plans to open a ninth logistics center in Germany, in the former East German state of Brandenburg, west of Berlin.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The strike was organized by the powerful service workers union ver.di, which has about 2.3 million members across Germany, and a sizable war chest to pay striking workers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Thomas Schneider, ver.di’s point man for organizing the strike at the Leipzig plant, argued that Amazon’s tactics, along with its refusal even to enter into talks with the unions, had created an image of being against its own work force that could hurt it in the long run.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘When it is put under pressure, Amazon reacts,’’ Mr. Schneider said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The company says that after a year, its German workers make more money on average than those in similar businesses. And it says it has complied with German labor laws by allowing worker councils at its warehouses. But these councils are legally forbidden from getting involved in wage deals, which is why the union wants to get involved.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In Germany, Mr. Clark of Amazon said, the strikes have not disrupted its business because the number of workers who have walked out has been relatively small. When necessary, the company has been able to shift orders to other facilities that are not striking, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The union, though, credits the strikes with recent improvements to overtime scheduling, an increase in the number of break rooms and a pledge by Amazon to pay Christmas bonuses, a standard practice in German industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">At a strike in June with hundreds of workers who gathered outside the gates of the Leipzig plant, the head of ver.di, Frank Bsirske, played on Amazon’s motto of ‘‘Work hard. Have fun. Make history,’’ telling the strikers they should take it to heart.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘You are making history by striking,’’ Mr. Bsirske told the crowd to cheers and whistles. ‘‘You are making history by demanding higher wages. We are not going to let a big American company come here and play Wild West. This is a clash of cultures.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130805e98500004</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_037.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark68">Business/Financial Desk; SECTA</a><a name="bookmark69">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s Founder to Buy The Washington Post</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY; Michael D.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe Washington Post, the newspaper whose reporting helped topple a president and inspired a generation of journalists, is being sold for $250 million to the founder of Amazon.com, Jeffrey P. Bezos, in a deal that has shocked the industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Donald E. Graham, chairman and chief executive of The Washington Post Company, and the third generation of the Graham family to lead the paper, told the staff about the sale late Monday afternoon. They had gathered together in the newspaper&#39;s auditorium at the behest of the publisher, Katharine Weymouth, his niece.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I, along with Katharine Weymouth and our board of directors, decided to sell only after years of familiar newspaper-industry challenges made us wonder if there might be another owner who would be better for the Post (after a transaction that would be in the best interest of our shareholders),&#39;&#39; Mr. Graham said in a written statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">In the auditorium, he closed his remarks by saying that nobody in the room should be sad -- except, he said, &#39;&#39;for me.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The announcement was greeted by what many staff members described as &#39;&#39;shock,&#39;&#39; a reaction shared in newsrooms across the country as one of the crown jewels of newspapers was surrendered by one of the industry&#39;s royal families.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In Mr. Bezos, The Post will have a very different owner, a technologist whose fortunes have risen in the last dozen years even as those of The Post and most newspapers have struggled. Through Amazon, the retailing giant, he has helped revolutionize the way people around the world consume -- first books, then expanding to all kinds of goods and more recently in online storage, electronic books and online video, including a recent spate of original programming.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the meeting, Mr. Graham stressed that Mr. Bezos would purchase The Post in a personal capacity and not on behalf of Amazon the company. The $250 million deal includes all of the publishing businesses owned by The Washington Post Company, including the Express newspaper, The Gazette Newspapers, Southern Maryland Newspapers, Fairfax County Times, El Tiempo Latino and Greater Washington Publishing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The Washington Post company plans to hold on to Slate magazine, The Root.com and Foreign Policy. According to the release, Mr. Bezos has asked Ms. Weymouth to remain at The Post along with Stephen P. Hills, president and general manager; Martin Baron, executive editor; and Fred Hiatt, editor of the editorial page.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Mr. Bezos, who did not attend the meeting at The Post on Monday, said in a statement that he had known Mr. Graham for the past decade and said about Mr. Graham that &#39;&#39;I do not know a finer man.&#39;&#39; Ms. Weymouth said that in negotiating this deal, Mr. Bezos made it clear he was not purely focused on profits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The sale, at a price that would have been unthinkably low even a few years ago, represents the end of eight decades of ownership by the Graham family of The Post since Eugene Meyer bought The Post at auction on June 1, 1933. His son-in-law Philip L. Graham served as president of the paper from 1947 until his death in 1963. Then Graham&#39;s widow, Katharine Graham, oversaw the paper through the publication of the Pentagon Papers alongside The New York Times and its coverage of Watergate, the political scandal that led to the resignation of Richard Nixon and also a starring role for the newspaper in the film, &#39;&#39;All The President&#39;s Men.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Post&#39;s daily circulation peaked in 1993 at 832,332, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. But like most newspapers, it has suffered greatly from circulation and advertising declines. By March, the newspaper&#39;s daily circulation had dropped to 474,767.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The company became pressed enough for cash that Ms. Weymouth announced in February that it was looking to sell its flagship headquarters. According to a regulatory filing associated with the sale, Mr. Bezos will pay rent to The Post Company on the space for up to three years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As of 2012, the newsroom, which once had more than 1,000 employees, had fewer than 640. People there on Monday described the mood as &#39;&#39;somber&#39;&#39; with &#39;&#39;a lot of people kind of in disbelief.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In an interview in July, Mr. Graham was cagey about the family&#39;s future in the business. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ll just fall back on the same answer,&#39;&#39; he said, adding, &#39;&#39;In family companies you have judgments about the family and you have professional judgment. The family control of The Washington Post Company over the years, I think, has been a healthy thing.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In an e-mail Monday, Ms. Weymouth, who replaced her uncle as publisher in 2008, talked about the effect of the sale on her family: &#39;&#39;Yes -- we knew the sale was coming. This was a process that was months in the making. It is, of course, sad for the family -- we have been incredibly honored to have been a part of The Post for the past 80, but we have always understood that this is a public trust and our focus was on ensuring that it would remain strong for generations of readers to come.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Post is not the only newspaper to move to new ownership. The New York Times Company announced early Saturday morning that it had sold its New England Media Group, which includes The Boston Globe, for $70 million, a fraction of the $1.1 billion the Times company paid for just The Globe in 1993. Ken Doctor, an analyst at Outsell, said that the Post sale reflected a broader trend of newspaper ownership returning to local investors rather than large, publicly traded enterprises.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Newspapers are not really much creatures of the marketplace anymore,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Doctor. &#39;&#39;They&#39;re not throwing off much in profits. They need shelter from the pressure of quarterly financial statements and reports.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Newspaper analysts also said that the sale seems to be good news for the future of The Post. Alan D. Mutter, a newspaper consultant who writes the blog Reflections of a Newsosaur, said that for the first time someone with a native digital background was purchasing a major newspaper rather than an old-time businessman who would try to restore The Post to its earlier heyday and treat it &#39;&#39;like 1953 Plymouths in Cuba.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">While Mr. Bezos may be purchasing The Post separate from Amazon, Mr. Mutter predicted that there could be collaborations between the brands, like The Post&#39;s content appearing on every Kindle or Post video content appearing on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;This is a guy who literally has invested in building rockets because he thinks it&#39;s a good idea. I believe he&#39;s bought the newspaper because he wants to re-envision the enterprise and The Post is an iconic world brand,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Mutter about Mr. Bezos. &#39;&#39;He knows something about building iconic world brands.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Shortly after the announcement, Leonard Downie, the Post&#39;s former executive editor, sat down at the Caribou Coffee store down the block from the newsroom he once led and contemplated a future where the Grahams no longer own the newspaper.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Graham had called Mr. Downie, now a vice president at The Post Company, earlier in the day. &#39;&#39;I was completely shocked,&#39;&#39; Mr. Downie said. &#39;&#39;I could hardly say anything.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Downie arrived at the paper nearly 50 years ago, and for all of the time since, the Graham family has been at the center of the newspaper -- and more broadly, he said, at the center of journalism in Washington.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The important thing about the Grahams for me,&#39;&#39; he said, referring to Ben Bradlee, his predecessor as executive editor, &#39;&#39;is that starting with Ben and with me, and I assume my successors, is that the news decisions were always ours, but the Grahams were always behind us.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Correction: August 13, 2013, Tuesday</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Tuesday about the sale of The Washington Post to Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, misspelled the given name of the father of Donald E. Graham, chairman and chief executive of The Washington Post Company. His father, who was a publisher of the paper and also president of the company, was Philip L. Graham, not Phillip.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Katharine Weymouth, publisher, and Donald E. Graham, chairman and chief executive, represent the third and fourth generations of the Graham family to lead The Washington Post.

Bezos paid on Monday for The Washington Post, which was once worth several billion dollars.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">$70 million. That&#39;s all John Henry paid on Friday for The Boston Globe, a paper The New York Times had acquired for $1.1 billion in 1993.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Next to nothing. That&#39;s what IBT Media paid to buy Newsweek over the weekend from IAC, which itself had paid only $1 plus $40 million in pension obligations to buy it two years ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How do you explain the prices that these storied media institutions have been sold for over the last 72 hours?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The answer has little to do with dollars and cents, spreadsheets and valuation metrics. If it did, in truth, the buyers might have paid even less.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">If it wasn&#39;t clear that newspapers have become trophies for the wealthy with an interest in journalism or power -- or a combination of both -- it should be now.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;These deals don&#39;t make financial sense,&#39;&#39; said Ken Doctor, an analyst at Outsell, a research and consulting firm for the publishing industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">He suggested that Mr. Bezos&#39;s valuation of The Washington Post was a generous gift. &#39;&#39;It is a combination of good will and real estate,&#39;&#39; he said, before adding, &#39;&#39;I mean good will in the moral sense, not the financial sense.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Mr. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon.com, is paying cash for The Washington Post out of his own personal wealth, currently estimated at more than $25 billion. The Post will cost him roughly 1 percent of what he owns in Amazon stock alone.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some billionaires like cars, yachts and private jets. Others like newspapers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Newspapers have gone from the public markets to the hands of a relatively few billionaires who have an appetite for social, civic and financial roles,&#39;&#39; Mr. Doctor said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Based on the math, it is hard to justify a $250 million valuation for The Washington Post. The company reported it lost nearly $50 million for the first half of the year on its newspaper operation that generated $138.4 million in revenue. Of the $50 million loss, nearly $40 million was a noncash pension expense. So you could argue that the company lost only $10 million on operations. But it lost $33 million in the first half of 2012, too, also including pension costs. Circulation fell about 7 percent in the first half of 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the end of last year, the company valued its newspaper assets at $293.6 million, no doubt a generous figure.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">For the Washington Post Company, which will remain publicly traded and renamed, probably to reflect its focus on its education business, Kaplan, and its television stations, the sale of the newspaper represents a very small part of its business. The Washington Post Company&#39;s market value is $4.2 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the newspaper, which has been owned by four generations of the family since 1933, was not just a business.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Underscoring the size of the newspaper to the company, Katharine Weymouth, publisher of the newspaper, justified the sale by saying this in an interview with The Washington Post: &#39;&#39;If journalism is the mission, given the pressures to cut costs and make profits, maybe (a publicly traded company) is not the best place for The Post.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">By taking the newspaper private, Mr. Bezos can afford to be a patient owner. Profit and loss is probably the least of his concerns. A running joke on Monday was this from Ben Popper, the editor at the Web site the Verge, on Twitter: &#39;&#39;Jeff Bezos has reputation for building great companies with little to no profit, perfect guy to own a newspaper.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">While Mr. Bezos may not be buying the paper for immediate profits, it may not be entirely altruistic either. His parents, Jackie and Mike Bezos, run the Bezos Family Foundation, which is not expected to be involved in the business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">As part of the deal, Mr. Bezos is assuming the pension obligations of the current employees of the newspaper. Compared with the deal John Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox, struck for The Boston Globe on Friday, Mr. Bezos looks like a lavish benefactor. Mr. Henry paid $70 million, but The Boston Globe has approximately $110 million in pension obligations, which The New York Times Company is keeping on its books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One billionaire who has been bullish on newspapers, not just as a benefactor, but as a business, is Warren Buffett. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, has acquired a series of newspapers, including The Omaha World-Herald, where he lives and grew up, and more from Media General.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In my conversations with him over the last year, he has stressed that he likes small, community newspapers because there is a built-in audience that can&#39;t get the news elsewhere. But he has expressed doubts about regional newspapers, like The Los Angeles Times. Berkshire is a major shareholder of the Washington Post Company and Mr. Buffett was on the board for many years, until 2011.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">At Berkshire&#39;s annual meeting, Mr. Buffett said he expected his newspapers to make a profit, but &#39;&#39;it&#39;s not going to move the needle at Berkshire.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">On Monday night, just hours after The Post announced its sale to Mr. Bezos, James Fallows, a former editor of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">U.S. News &amp; World Report who writes for The Atlantic, said the deal put him in a state of shock.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;Let us hope,&#39;&#39; he wrote, &#39;&#39;that this is what the sale signifies: The beginning of a phase in which this Gilded Age&#39;s major beneficiaries reinvest in the infrastructure of our public intelligence.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Washington Post announced on Monday that Jeffrey P.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Updated, 4:53 p.m. | In July, the Justice Department won its antitrust lawsuit that accused Apple of conspiring with publishers to raise the prices of e-books. Now, the government wants to use its victory to discipline Apple in other markets where it does business, like movies, music and television shows.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Justice Department on Friday proposed guidelines to the United States District Court in Lower Manhattan on how to enforce the July ruling. The guidelines suggest that Apple should be forced to terminate its existing agreements with five major publishers and also avoid entering similar agreements in the future with providers of music, movies and TV shows and games.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The guidelines would put rules in place to prevent Apple from facilitating price-fixing among publishers, or from retaliating against publishers that refuse to bend to its terms. The Justice Department also suggested that Apple allow Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble to insert links inside their e-book apps to their e-bookstores, so that consumers can easily compare prices of e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“The court found that Apple’s illegal conduct deprived consumers of the benefits of e-book price competition and forced them to pay substantially higher prices,” William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, said in a statement. “Under the department’s proposed order, Apple’s illegal conduct will cease and Apple and its senior executives will be prevented from conspiring to thwart competition in the future.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In a statement filed by Apple’s legal counsel, Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, Apple said the government’s proposal was a “draconian and punitive intrusion” into its business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The “overreaching proposal would establish a vague new compliance regime — applicable only to Apple — with intrusive oversight lasting for 10 years, going far beyond the legal issues in this case, injuring competition and consumers, and violating basic principles of fairness and due process,” Apple’s lawyer, Orin Snyder, said in its statement. “The resulting cost of this relief — not only in dollars but also lost opportunities for American businesses and consumers — would be vast.”</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Justice Department declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the case, brought last year, the Justice Department accused Apple and five book publishers of conspiring to raise e-book prices. It cast Apple as the ringmaster of the conspiracy, colluding with the publishers to collectively help them defeat Amazon’s uniform pricing of $9.99 for new e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As part of its pitch, Apple asked the publishers to switch to a different model of selling books, called agency pricing, in which the publishers set the price of the books instead of the retailers. The publishers’ contracts with Apple included a so-called most-favored-nation clause, requiring that no other retailer sell e-books for a lower price; if they did, the publisher would have to match the price of the e-book in Apple’s store. That, the Justice Department said, defeated price competition and resulted in higher prices across the industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The Justice Department’s proposed remedy would presumably prohibit Apple from using contracts with a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">most-favored-nation clause to help providers of music, TV shows and movies raise their prices. But it is unlikely that it would have implications for every contract that includes a most-favored-nation clause. The judge, Denise L. Cote, said in her ruling against Apple that the most-favored-nation clause itself was not the issue, but more specifically the manner in which the clause was used as a mechanism to execute a price-fixing conspiracy.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Outside the book business, it is still unclear whether most-favored-nation clauses raise prices for other industries, like music, said Charles E. Elder, an antitrust lawyer at Irell &amp; Manella. “One question is, to what extent would Apple’s getting rid of most-favored-nation clauses in those industries help for competition?” Mr. Elder said. “I don’t know the answer to that question, but it’s one the court should think about before rubber-stamping a requested remedy by the Department of Justice.”</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Judge Cote will hold a hearing next week to discuss the Justice Department’s proposed remedy.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/daily-report-apple-ruling-strengthens-amazons-powerful-hand/">Daily Report: Apple Ruling Strengthens Amazon’s Powerful Hand</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/daily-report-apple-says-antitrust-case-challenges-way-most-business-is-done/" class="a" target="_blank">Daily Report: Apple Says Antitrust Case Challenges Way Most Business Is </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/daily-report-apple-says-antitrust-case-challenges-way-most-business-is-done/" target="_blank">Done</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/apple-and-netflix-dominate-online-video/" class="a" target="_blank">Apple and Netflix Dominate Online </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/apple-and-netflix-dominate-online-video/" target="_blank">Video</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/daily-report-apple-cast-as-ringmaster-in-e-book-pricing-case/">Daily Report: Apple Cast as ‘Ringmaster’ in E-Book Pricing Case</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/daily-report-prosecutors-say-apple-had-greater-role-in-fixing-e-book-prices/" class="a" target="_blank">Daily Report: Prosecutors Say Apple Had Greater Role in Fixing E-Book </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/daily-report-prosecutors-say-apple-had-greater-role-in-fixing-e-book-prices/" target="_blank">Prices</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Apple’s iBooks 2 app. The Justice Department offered guidelines for the company’s behavior after winning an antitrust suit. | Mario Tama/Getty Images | Apple’s iBooks 2 app. The Justice Department offered guidelines for the company’s behavior after winning an antitrust suit. | Mario Tama/Getty Images</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020130802e982001xh</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_044.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark82">Watch List Arts; Television</a><a name="bookmark83">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Spoofy Heroes, Super and Otherwise, Join the Streaming Fray</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By MIKE HALE</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">909 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">1 August 2013 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013.

By that measure, Hulu is the scrappy, undersized contender of the Big Three, ranking below Netflix, the steamrollering champion, but above Amazon, which is still standing outside the ring lacing its gloves.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The analogy holds regardless of what you think about ballyhooed Netflix series like “House of Cards,” “Orange Is the New Black” and the rebooted “Arrested Development” and whether you think the company’s streaming-video wing deserves its 14 Emmy nominations. It’s undeniable that the shows Netflix has developed have a substance and sheen comparable to the output of premium cable channels like HBO and Showtime. The original series at Hulu are slighter and cheaper, falling somewhere between basic cable and YouTube.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.hulu.com/the-awesomes" class="s1" target="_blank">They’re also less frequent: </a>“The Awesomes,”<span class="p">Hulu’s latest (it goes live on Thursday) and most high-profile original show, is its first since the travel series “Up to Speed” last August.

Perhaps, if all you pay attention to is original series. But they make up a tiny fraction of these companies’ offerings, and it’s worth stepping back to look at the overall picture.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">While Netflix and Amazon, as well as the Walmart service Vudu, have much more extensive movie offerings than Hulu, things are considerably different when it comes to TV, and especially current shows. Netflix is great for past seasons, but for episodes from current seasons, you’re pretty much limited to Amazon Instant and Hulu. (Vudu and iTunes also offer current shows, but little or no original-series content.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The television selections at Amazon and Hulu overlap, and Amazon has more extensive offerings. The key difference — strangely seldom remarked on — is that Amazon charges at least $1.99 for each episode of many of the shows you would want to watch. That’s on top of the $79 annual Amazon Prime membership. A Hulu Plus subscription of $8 a month gives you free viewing of all shows available on Hulu. This summer, that includes quite a few of the more noteworthy or popular series: “The Bridge” from FX, “Twisted” and “The Fosters” from ABC Family, “Graceland” from USA, “Longmire” and “The Glades” from A&amp;E, “Devious Maids” from Lifetime, “Mistresses” and “Rookie Blue” from ABC.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">And beyond the category of “original” lies the broader category of “exclusive,” generally referring to foreign TV series receiving their American premieres on just one online service. Netflix scored a coup here recently with the British crime show “The Fall,” but Hulu has done the best job of securing and promoting interesting foreign shows, from the Israeli drama “Prisoners of War” (the inspiration for “Homeland”) to the Irish comedy “Moone Boy” and the Danish “Curb Your Enthusiasm” clone “Klown,” added two weeks ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The big downside at Hulu — and for many viewers it’s a deal breaker — is the presence of commercials. But given the available selection and the price, many people may forgive 90-second ad breaks at the naturally occurring spots in TV shows. It’s not that much more irritating than fast-forwarding through the commercials on your DVR.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The real issue with Hulu’s original series, as opposed to those on Netflix, is that they look insubstantial next to the regular TV fare, which is what you’re really paying for. “The Awesomes,” with Mr. Meyers as the voice of a very minor superhero who assumes the leadership of a Justice League-style team, is cute but, in its pilot episode, surprisingly ordinary. The live-action “Quick Draw,” with Mr. Lehr as the irritating, Harvard-educated sheriff in a dangerous Kansas town, is looser and funnier and might turn out to be more interesting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But they both leave Hulu waiting for its first big thing. It has a few more chances before the end of the year, including “The Wrong Mans” (Nov. 11), a new British comedy whose cast includes very funny people like James Corden and Dawn French.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Correction: August 1, 2013, Thursday</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misidentified an actor starring in Hulu’s animated series “The Awesomes.” He is Seth Meyers, not John Lehr.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Hulu hopes shows like “The Awesomes,&quot; starring Seth Meyers, will help the service gain ground on Netflix. | Hulu</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">| “Quick Draw,” starring John Lehr. | Doug Huyn/Hulu | A scene from “The Awesomes.” | Hulu</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020130731e9810038p</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_045.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark84">Foreign Desk; SECTA</a><a name="bookmark85">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Wiesenthal Center Calls for Closing of German Magazine It Says Glorifies Nazism</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By JACK EWING</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">766 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">31 July 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 8</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

Acting on what it said were several recent complaints, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles invoked German laws against Nazi propaganda and Holocaust denials in asking Berlin last week to shut down Der Landser.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">German Interior Ministry officials said they took the Wiesenthal Center complaint &#39;&#39;very seriously&#39;&#39; and would investigate. But in the meantime, companies that print and distribute Der Landser said they would continue doing so, noting that previous legal challenges had failed to find fault with the editorial stance of the magazine, whose relatively small circulation belies its lightning-rod role in Germany.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The new focus on Der Landser is the latest incarnation of a debate -- one that has lasted decades -- over the balance between free speech and efforts in Germany to eradicate the neo-Nazi movement and tamp down anti-Semitism.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The magazine, which advertises that it is based on true events but also clearly includes fictional elements, studiously avoids mentioning the word &#39;&#39;Nazi&#39;&#39; and does not overtly propagate anti-Semitism. But critics say Der Landser, with its failure to acknowledge atrocities and little sense of regret for the deaths of millions of people, is stuck in a World War II time warp that ignores efforts by broader German society to come to terms with Nazi crimes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The way they interpret it, everyone in the Wehrmacht was just like in the American Army or the Canadian Army or the British Army,&#39;&#39; said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Wiesenthal Center, using the term for the German armed forces at that time. &#39;&#39;They forget the most important point.

Mr. Conrady said the magazine subtly promotes nationalism by</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">portraying German soldiers, even from the SS, as sympathetic everymen who were morally superior to their enemies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Conrady said a ban of the magazine would simply drive such material underground. It would be more useful to promote public knowledge of the issues raised by the magazine&#39;s portrayal of history, he said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s important for the public to be aware of this phenomenon,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The magazine&#39;s editor in chief, Guntram Schulze-Wegener, who is in his late 40s, waved off assertions that Der Landser plays to contemporary extreme rightist sentiments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Schulze-Wegener, who also edits several other magazines about military history, said the content was nonpolitical.

The law enforcement authorities in Dresden, the capital of Saxony, said they often found copies of Der Landser when they raided homes of those suspected of being neo-Nazis.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘The way they interpret it, everyone in the Wehrmacht was just like in the American Army or the Canadian Army or the British Army,’’ said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Wiesenthal Center, using the term for the German armed forces at that time. ‘‘They forget the most important point.

It has been the subject</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">of several critical academic studies and reports in the German news media, and individual issues of the magazine have been sanctioned by a government office that vets news media content that could harm young people.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But even some experts skeptical of its pseudo-historical tales of military heroics and camaraderie among German forces question whether the magazine violates the prohibition against glorifying Nazism or denying the Holocaust.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Legally, there is not much to grab on to,’’ said Peter Conrady, a retired professor of literature at the University of Dortmund who has studied Der Landser.

In a brief telephone interview, Guntram Schulze-Wegener, the editor in chief of Der Landser, as well as several other magazines about military history, said the content was nonpolitical. Mr. Schulze-Wegener, who is in his late 40s, declined to comment further, saying he had to first consult with his superiors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Der Landser’s publisher, Bauer Media Group, cited previous rulings by German officials that the magazine did not violate any laws.

The Wiesenthal Center said it planned to complain to Apple but had not done so as of Friday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">If anything, the recent criticism from the Wiesenthal Center seems likely to bring new, unflattering attention to Bauer, which is based in Hamburg. The center was named for Simon Wiesenthal, the famed Nazi hunter who helped the authorities locate war criminals like Adolf Eichmann. Bauer is a privately owned publishing giant with extensive business in the United States and other markets outside Europe.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Bauer’s U.S. titles include In Touch, the celebrity magazine, and also several soap opera fan magazines, including ABC Soaps in Depth. It also publishes the German edition of Cosmopolitan and Australian editions of Rolling Stone and a girl’s magazine called Disney Princess, according to the company’s Web site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Rabbi Hier said the Wiesenthal Center decided to complain to Bauer, Amazon and the German authorities after receiving several complaints and reviewing a study conducted for the center by Stefan Klemp, a German journalist and historian. Mr. Klemp compiled evidence that numerous officers profiled reverentially in Der Landser belonged to units that had committed atrocities, even if they were never themselves convicted of war crimes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One recent issue, for example, described the exploits of August Zingel, a member of a so-called SS-Totenkopf, or ‘‘Death’s Head,’’ unit. Members of the Totenkopf units were notorious for their role running concentration camps, including Auschwitz, though that fact was not mentioned by Der Landser. According to the magazine, Mr. Zingel survived the war and died in 2000 at the age of 79.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Far from being a mark of guilt, the silver skull insignia of the Totenkopf unit is portrayed in the story as a badge of honor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘On the day that he was accepted into the SS-Totenkopf unit,’’ the text says of one soldier, ‘‘he stepped out of the shadow of his older brother. He had made it.’’ The story tells how the soldier was then able to marry his dream wife, Edeltraud, who bore him two healthy children.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Critics say the magazine provides fodder for the far right’s fascination with World War II military awards and medals. The magazine features profiles of officers who were awarded the Knight’s Cross, a version of the Iron Cross, which predated the rise of the Nazis but was appropriated by them.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Der Landser is seen as part of a far-right subculture that evades bans on swastikas and blatant Nazi propaganda with an elaborate system of codes and cultural markers they use to identify themselves. A tattoo of the numbers ‘‘88’’ stands for ‘‘HH’’ or ‘‘Heil Hitler.’’ (H is the eighth letter in the alphabet.) Clothing with the Thor Steinar brand has become so closely associated with neo-Nazism that some soccer clubs refuse to allow people wearing the label into stadiums. The Iron Cross belongs to the catalog of favored neo-Nazi symbols. Der Landser also provides this subculture a body of literature they can call their own, critics say.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Even outside far-right circles, though, there remains a debate in Germany about how much blame the regular German Army of World War II bears for war crimes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In April, a huge television audience tuned in for a three-part fictional mini-series, ‘‘Unser Mütter, unsere Väter’’ (‘‘Our Mothers, Our Fathers’’), which dealt with how World War II distorted the moral outlook of five young German friends. The film depicted Wehrmacht soldiers murdering civilians, including children. Though the series generally won praise, a few critics argued that it ignored the large number of soldiers who were neither war criminals nor resisters, but were just trying to survive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Many Germans still regard the regular army as largely guilt-free. Joachim Wolf, who operates several anti-Nazi Web sites, said that Der Landser perpetuated the myth that atrocities were the work of a few fanatics and that most German soldiers remained ‘‘pure.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">‘‘The crimes are completely ignored,’’ Mr. Wolf said. ‘‘That plays into the hands of the right-wingers.’’ Document INHT000020130728e97t0000s</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_047.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark88">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark89">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">A New Role for Amazon: An Engine for Jobs</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By NICK WINGFIELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">555 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">28 July 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

But one tech icon, Amazon, is seeking to call attention to the thousands of working-class jobs it’s creating in the United States.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On Monday, Amazon plans to announce it is creating more than 5,000 new full-time jobs in its United States warehouses to handle growing customer demand. The company currently employs more than 20,000 warehouse workers here, so the new positions represent a significant increase in its head count.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon’s announcement is timed to coincide with a speech on middle-class jobs that President Obama is expected to give Tuesday at an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga, Tenn.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The jobs will be in warehouses in 10 states, from Delaware to California.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">For a tech company, Amazon is an unusual hybrid of white- and blue-collar jobs. It employs plenty of computer scientists, MBAs and all the usual types found at technology companies. But it also relies on tens of thousands of people to do the sweaty, physical work of picking, packing and delivering Amazon orders. Those are jobs Amazon can’t outsource to China (though the company, like nearly all electronics makers, does have its electronic device, the Kindle, made overseas).</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://articles.mcall.com/2011-09-18/news/mc-allentown-amazon-complaints-20110917_1_warehouse-workers-heat-stress-brutal-heat" class="s1" target="_blank">How great those jobs are is a matter of some debate.

The company says it remedied the heat problem by installing air-conditioning in its facilities. Amazon has also resisted union organizing at its warehouses.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon said median pay in its warehouses is 30 percent higher than retail pay in those same areas. That doesn’t include the stock grants full-time employees receive, which over the past five years have added an average of 9 percent to workers’ base pay annually.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The sheer numbers of people Amazon is hiring has obviously landed the company on the radar screen of politicians stumping for job growth. Since September 2008, around the start of the most recent recession, Amazon said it has added more than 40,000 jobs in the United States, including warehouse and white-collar jobs.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/technology/amazon-reports-a-small-loss.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Just last week, Amazon </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/technology/amazon-reports-a-small-loss.html" class="a" target="_blank">reported</a> <span style=" color: #000;">that it has 97,000 full-time employees around the globe, an eye-popping 40 percent increase from a year ago.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon’s razor-thin profits turned to razor-thin losses in the last quarter, as the Internet commerce giant continued to plow money into warehouses, digital content and other big investments that it says will pay off down the line.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But with revenue up 22 percent, Amazon showed that it could still deliver the sales growth demanded by investors, who have lifted the company’s stock 21 percent this year. So far, those demands do not include an insistence on big profits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Until it does, Amazon seems content to pour money into initiatives aimed at gobbling up an increasing share of spending by consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">For the quarter that ended June 30, Amazon said late Thursday that it had a net loss of $7 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with net income of $7 million, or a penny a share, in the period a year earlier. Amazon’s revenue was $15.7 billion, up from $12.83 billion a year earlier.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The results were slightly below the estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, who had expected Amazon to report earnings of 5 cents a share and revenue of $15.73 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The miss did not seem to trouble investors too much. The company’s stock was up 6.8 percent in afternoon trading Friday, after a 4.5 percent gain on Thursday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A good illustration of Amazon’s long-term bets is online video. The company is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on licensing rights to build a large library of video that its customers can watch through their Kindle tablets and other devices. These agreements are critical as movies, music and other media, which account for 28 percent of Amazon’s total sales, shift from physical to digital form.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The company recently cut its biggest such deal ever, with a multiyear agreement to license television shows from Viacom, including children’s shows like ‘‘Dora the Explorer’’ and ‘‘SpongeBob SquarePants.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As a result, Amazon spent almost 47 percent more on technology and content in the quarter, for a total of $1.59 billion, or roughly 10 percent of its total revenue. Included in that spending is the company’s investment in Amazon Web Services, a lucrative business through which it rents capacity in its data centers to other companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘We’re investing for the large opportunities we have in front of us,’’ Tom Szkutak, the company’s chief financial officer, said during a conference call.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">While Amazon is feared as a seller of physical goods, it faces several formidable rivals in the digital content business, including Netflix, Apple, Hulu, Microsoft and Google.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Still, Amazon is also spending aggressively on the warehouses it needs to deliver physical goods, building them ever closer to big cities with the goal of offering next-day, or even same-day, deliveries to shoppers. This year, Amazon started selling groceries in the Los Angeles area, using its own trucks to shuttle fruit, meat and boxes of cereal from a new warehouse in the city to customers’ doorsteps.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The effort is expensive and risky, though Amazon would not say whether or how much money it was losing on it. The grocery business has killed Internet retailers before — Webvan was the most notable casualty — so Amazon chose not to expand its service beyond a test in Seattle until recently.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The challenge we’ve had over the past several years is how to make it economically viable,’’ Mr. Szkutak said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">All the spending on warehouses and other projects has led to a surge in hiring at the company. Its head count swelled to 97,000, up more than 40 percent from 69,000 a year ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A big part of Amazon’s allure for investors remains its pre-eminent position in e-commerce. E-commerce sales worldwide are expected to grow 18.3 percent this year to $1.3 trillion, according to eMarketer. Much of that growth is coming from Asia, the research group said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Kerry Rice, an analyst at Needham &amp; Company, said many investors believed that Amazon could keep stealing market share from physical retailers, and that eventually its profits would improve.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘On some level, I think some people are buying the stock because they’re hoping for that investment cycle to begin to reduce,’’ Mr. Rice said. ‘‘If they pull back on spending, you’re going to see that operating margin tick up.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">But Mr. Rice added: ‘‘I don’t think that’s going to happen for a long time.’’ Document INHT000020130727e97r00003</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_049.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark92">B</a><a name="bookmark93">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">AMAZON REPORTS SMALL LOSS AS IT FOCUSES ON INVESTMENTS</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By NICK WINGFIELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">59 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">26 July 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

Scores of companies, countries and organizations have applied to use their names or other terms as global top-level domains, alongside the handful of existing ones like .com and .org.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">While Icann has approved several new dot-terms, including the Chinese word for game and the Russian word for network, English-language brand names derived from geographical locations have proved to be more complicated.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the run-up to the Durban meeting, a group of Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, sent a letter to Icann, in which they argued that. amazon should be rejected because a river runs through it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“In particular ‘. amazon’ is a geographic name that represents important territories of some of our countries, which have relevant communities, with their own culture and identity directly connected with the name,” the letter said. “Beyond the specifics, this should also be understood as a matter of principle.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The group had also objected to another application, from the outdoor clothier Patagonia, to use its name as an address suffix. That application was withdrawn before the Durban meeting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The decision on. amazon, by the Governmental Advisory Committee of Icann, is not necessarily final. The Icann board could overrule the committee, though in practice it rarely does so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“We’re reviewing the G.A.C. advice and we look forward to working with Icann and other stakeholders to resolve these issues as the process moves forward,” Amazon said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One thing that remains unclear is why the United States government, represented in the Government Advisory Committee by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, an arm of the Commerce Department, went along with the decision.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before the meeting, it sent a letter to Icann in which it outlined its support for the use of names like. amazon as Internet suffixes, but added that it would stand aside if other governments objected.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“The United States affirms our support for the free flow of information and freedom of expression and does not view sovereignty as a valid basis for objecting to the use of terms, and we have concerns about the effect of such claims on the integrity of the process,” the administration said in the letter. “However, in the event the parties cannot reach agreement by the time this matter comes up for decision in the G.A.C., the United States is willing in Durban to abstain and remain neutral.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One analyst said that while the specific reasons the United States government went along with the rejection were unclear, its position on Internet governance issues had been weakened by the recent leaks of information about a vast digital surveillance program by the National Security Agency. Several countries in South America — though not those in the Amazon basin or the Patagonian region — have offered the leaker, Edward J. Snowden, asylum.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“It is clear that the leaks of sensitive national security information have severely weakened the U.S. government’s ability to fight for our economic interests and have left the U.S. isolated in the G.A.C.,” said Nao Matsukata, chief executive of FairWinds Partners, a Washington-based consulting firm that specializes in domain name strategy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Milton Mueller, a professor at the Syracuse University School of Information Studies, said there might have been an element of horse-trading. By yielding to a broader consensus on the advisory committee, Washington could have been seeking to shore up broader support for Icann, whose control over the Internet address system has long irked the governments of countries like Russia and China.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“My hypothesis is that the U.S. government has been scared to death for some time that if G.A.C. doesn’t get enough of what it wants, governments will give up on the whole Icann regime,” Mr. Mueller said.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/13/google-wants-love-and-90-other-things/">Google Wants Love and 100 Other Things</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/daily-report-apple-ruling-strengthens-amazons-powerful-hand/">Daily Report: Apple Ruling Strengthens Amazon’s Powerful Hand</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/the-price-of-amazon/" class="a" target="_blank">The Price of </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/the-price-of-amazon/" target="_blank">Amazon</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/technology-workers-are-young-really-young/">Technology Workers Are Young (Really Young)</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/apple-and-netflix-dominate-online-video/" class="a" target="_blank">Apple and Netflix Dominate Online </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/apple-and-netflix-dominate-online-video/" target="_blank">Video</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A group of Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, argued that the “.amazon” domain was too intrinsically connected to the regions and communities within their borders to allow the online retailer access to use it. | Mauricio Lima for The New York Times | A group of Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, argued that the “.amazon” domain was too intrinsically connected to the regions and communities within their borders to allow the online retailer access to use it. | Mauricio Lima for The New York Times</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020130718e97i002ml</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_051.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark96">finance</a><a name="bookmark97">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">A bookstore that is good for Amazon; The Media Equation</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID CARR</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">1,125 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">16 July 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">International Herald Tribune INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On Thursday night in Clifton, New Jersey, Barnes &amp; Noble was a way station, a third place between work and home where people sought respite and diversion. With its high ceilings, wide aisles and a large Starbucks, it is the kind of retail outlet that gives big-box stores a good name.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In one aisle, a father and daughter were having a spirited generational discussion over the side-by-side covers of ‘‘The Great Gatsby,’’ one of which bore an image of Leonardo DiCaprio. For reasons I was not quite clear about but nonetheless found charming, an older couple used a book on vegetarian cooking to cover up a copy of ‘‘The Art of Seduction’’ on the shelf. Nearby, two apparent siblings, one sporting pink hair and the other purple, traded loud opinions over the True Crime display.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Watching the readers lounge in chairs with a view of Route 3, it was hard to reconcile the pageantry of retailing with the brutal recent headlines about the book business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">At the beginning of July, the Big Six publishers became the Big Five with the blending of Penguin and Random House. At the beginning of last week, the chief executive of Barnes &amp; Noble left the company after a grim earnings report that highlighted a failed strategy to have the company’s Nook device compete in the crowded tablet space.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Then on Thursday, Judge Denise L. Cote of U.S. District Court in New York issued a withering decision against Apple, writing that the company had conspired with the major publishers to fix the price of e-books in an effort to thwart Amazon.com’s momentum.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">So far, what has been bad for the industry has not yet hit consumers directly. If they are among the many millions of people enthralled by the CBS television mini-series ‘‘Under the Dome’’ and decide to read the giant Stephen King novel that inspired it, they can hop on Amazon and buy it with a click for $13.99. Or they could avoid its</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">door-stopping heft and spend just $7.99 for the Kindle version.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">No wonder that e-book sales boomed last year, including a 42 percent increase in sales of fiction. Net revenue for publishers also climbed more than $1 billion in 2012, to $15 billion, according to BookStats, an annual survey of the book business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">But while publishers revel in the robust margins provided by e-books — no manufacturing, no shipping and no remaindering — the growth of Amazon leaves them as secondary characters in a business they used to control.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Apple may be the one that was found guilty of setting prices, but Amazon has the kind of market power that allows it to set prices unilaterally. The company is already pulling back on discounts on scholarly and small-press books.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble tried to keep up with the technological shift, but the company’s earnings were perforated by a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">$177 million loss from its Nook e-reader division, and that news took out William Lynch Jr., the chief executive, and threw a deep scare into publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In my view, Barnes &amp; Noble is a company that did the right thing, and got clobbered anyway. When most media companies get into the device business, what pops out is clunky and useless, but the Nook is an excellent reading device that drew critical praise and, initially, buyers. At a time when legacy media companies are derided for letting the future overtake them, Barnes &amp; Noble aggressively innovated.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon, however, had not only the Kindle, but consumer relationships, inventory and technical know-how that could not be overcome. And as consumers moved from e-readers to tablets to take advantage of other functions, like video, the Nook ended up in a corner.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the last Christmas season, Nook sales were down 12.6 percent compared with the period a year earlier.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But the current spate of bad news may mask underlying strengths. As Bloomberg News pointed out on Thursday, Leonard Riggio, the 72-year-old architect of Barnes &amp; Noble’s national buildup, is still considering buying the physical stores and taking them private, in part because the fundamentals of that business are still solid, if not spectacular. In the fiscal year that ended in April, the retail stores and Web site generated earnings of $374.2 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a 16 percent increase, even as sales declined almost 6 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One of the parties that might want to root for Barnes &amp; Noble is Amazon. Sales of e-books fell immediately after Borders went under, leading some to suggest that reduced opportunity to browse the physical artifact had resulted in less online buying.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Having a bookstore in your neighborhood, as opposed to one that is bookmarked on your browser, is an invitation. Not long ago, I was walking by an airport bookstore and thought, ‘‘What if this was the only place to buy books?’’ Similar to Hollywood, only the blockbusters would get shelf space.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">After Borders called it quits two years ago this week, Barnes &amp; Noble became the last big chain where publishers could get the exposure for their books that allows readers to discover them, and to sell all manner of books big and small that are still part of the foundation of the industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Morgan Entrekin, publisher at Grove/Atlantic, says everyone has skin in the retail game. ‘‘We need to have a diversity of distribution channels to be healthy, and Amazon may want it all, but they are smart enough to know that. People can’t live online all the time.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Bookstores offer discoverability, not just the latest Dan Brown or Carl Hiaasen book on the front table, but sometimes treasures deep in the stacks, a long tail of midlist authors and specialty books.Even as the book business consolidates, the physical object displayed in an actual place will continue to be an important part of the ecosystem.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Let’s hope it survives. From the balcony of the Barnes &amp; Noble, what looked like the buzz of literary commerce was less impressive on closer inspection. The checkout line was busy because there were only two people working the registers. And the coffee shop was not so much an amenity for consumers on the go as a spot where people camped out and pawed over magazines they had not bought and probably never would.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On the way out of the store, I saw the father and daughter who had been arguing over the ‘‘Gatsby’’ cover. They had bought neither, but they had probably settled on which one they were going to buy on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130715e97g0002x</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_052.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark98">C</a><a name="bookmark99">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">AN AMAZON COMIC LINE FOR PRINT AND KINDLE</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By GEORGE GENE GUSTINES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">42 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">13 July 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

The easy money was always on the Justice Department, which had evidence that Apple conspired with five major book publishers to manipulate the market. Yet it remains an open question whether these legal proceedings served consumers’ best interest.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Before Apple launched its iBookstore in 2010, Amazon controlled 90 percent of the e-book market. Amazon set retail prices as it saw fit, often steeply discounting best-sellers and hawking them for $9.99, at a loss. Not unreasonably, publishers worried that Amazon was too dominant and were delighted when Apple came on the scene, introducing an “agency model” in which the publishers set retail prices and Apple took a cut. Apple proposed price caps of $12.99 and $14.99 for new releases, with contracts that also included a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“most-favored-nation” clause: if a competitor’s list price for an e-book ever dipped below Apple’s, the publishers would match it, allowing the iBookstore to offer the best deal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Justice Department argued, and Judge Denise Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan agreed, that Apple “facilitated a horizontal conspiracy” to eliminate retail price competition. Once the publishers were cozy with Apple, the Justice Department said, they used that relationship as a cudgel against Amazon, threatening to withhold new content unless Amazon moved to the agency model and let prices rise. The strategy worked.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Amazon switched, and its prices went up.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">To make its case, the government unearthed a telling e-mail from Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive at the time, in which he said he could tolerate Apple’s contracts with the publishers “as long as they move Amazon to the agent model too for new releases for the first year.”</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple plans to appeal the decision.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2013/apple-ibooks-at-24-worldwide-ebook-market-share-one-analyst-thinks-so/" class="s1" target="_blank">The big picture is that while Apple’s pact with the publishers raised prices in the short term, it also brought much-needed competition to the e-book marketplace.

This week, Amazon Publishing announced the start of Jet City Comics, a new imprint devoted to comics and graphic novels.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The comics will be available digitally on the Kindle and will also have print editions sold on amazon.com and at other comic book retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Jet City&#39;s first offering is the opening issue of &#39;&#39;Symposium,&#39;&#39; written by Christian Cameron and illustrated by Dmitry Bondarenko. It is part of &#39;&#39;The Foreworld Saga,&#39;&#39; which begins in 13th-century Europe, about a group of mystics and warriors who must turn back a Mongol invasion. In October, adaptations of the short story &#39;&#39;Meathouse Man,&#39;&#39; by George R. R. Martin, and the science fiction novel &#39;&#39;Wool,&#39;&#39; will follow.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Our focus will be on adapting great books for this medium as a means of expanding the audience for our authors, pushing boundaries with new ideas that combine visual and narrative storytelling, and creating compelling new experiences for readers,&#39;&#39; said Jeff Belle, the vice president of Amazon Publishing, in a statement. &#39;&#39;Symposium&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Wool&#39;&#39; will each be released digitally as six-issue series before being collected as graphic novels in 2014.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Over the 15 years I’ve been consulting in the corporate world, I’ve only met a handful of senior leaders who had as a primary goal for their companies making a positive difference in the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Surely, there are more such people, including a good number who are highly philanthropic outside their work. Still, as best as I can tell, higher purpose is not a common characteristic of the corporate world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">I don’t say this to bash business, nor to make a moral case for why leaders ought to focus more on serving the greater good. I fully understand that a primary obligation of any business is to earn a profit, and that without one, nothing else is possible. I also know that no amount of righteous haranguing is going to prompt leaders to fully embrace priorities beyond the bottom line.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But what if they believed that articulating and embracing a nobler purpose would help them to attract, inspire and retain better employees, and ultimately make their companies more profitable?</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/john_p_mackey/index.html?inline=nyt-per" class="s1" target="_blank">As </a><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/john_p_mackey/index.html?inline=nyt-per" class="a" target="_blank">John Mackey</a> <span style=" color: #000;">and Raj Sisodia put it in their book “Conscious Capitalism,” “Just as happiness is best experienced by not aiming for it directly, profits are best achieved by not making them the primary goal of the business. They are the outcome when companies do business with a higher sense of purpose.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Professor Sisodia’s research, which I’ve cited before, suggests that “conscious companies”— characterized in part by an explicit commitment to a higher purpose – outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index from 1996 to 2011 by an astonishing 10.5 to 1.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Much of this is common sense. All things being equal, would you rather work at a company focused solely on maximizing profits, or one with a deep commitment to adding real value to the world through its products, practices and services? Wouldn’t you find a greater sense of meaning by working for the latter, feel a greater sense of commitment and be less likely to leave?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Employee engagement in the United States (and throughout most of the world) remains depressingly low. According to the latest Gallup poll, 70 percent of Americans are either not engaged or are actively disengaged from their companies. According to Gallup, the cost to productivity just from the actively disengaged employees is</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">$450 billion to $550 billion a year.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the simplest terms, a purpose defines the difference an organization is trying to make in the world. In some cases, that’s a natural and straightforward outgrowth of what the organization actually does to earn a profit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Whole Foods, for example, is explicitly committed to helping people to eat well, as a way to improve the quality of their lives and increase their lifespan.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Patagonia sets out to model sustainable environmental practices by taking complete responsibility for every product it makes – repairing, recycling and helping people sell those products when they no longer need them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Eileen Fisher, the clothing company, has a five-part mission that includes producing “only what we love,” creating a “joyful atmosphere in the workplace” and “supporting women through social initiatives that address their</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">well-being.” Or put even more simply: “Have our mission drive our business and our profitability foster our mission.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">There are many ways to create a nobler purpose in an organization, even if the products or services themselves intrinsically do not. Toms Shoes, for example, makes a very conventional product, but founder Blake Mycoskie has infused passion among employees partly by giving away, with each purchase of a pair of shoes, a second pair to someone needy. Now Toms is expanding that model to other products, including eyewear.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The company is also consistently profitable, not least because its noble purpose is differentiating, and appealing to consumers. We live in a highly commoditized world. Why couldn’t a big bank differentiate itself by using a matching model like Toms does and offer, say, financial planning to those who are needy?</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=AMZN&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="s1" target="_blank">It’s also possible to build a noble purpose around caring deeply about your customers.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, loves disrupting markets. In that regard, he must be having a delightful summer. The book business, once so mired in the past it seemed part of the antiques trade, is up for grabs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A U.S. judge ruled Wednesday that Apple had illegally conspired with five of the six biggest publishers to try to raise prices in the budding e-book market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The decision came two days after Barnes &amp; Noble lost its chief executive and said it would not appoint another, signaling that the biggest chain of physical bookstores could be immediately broken up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The verdict in the Apple case might have been a foregone conclusion, telegraphed by the judge herself, but it emphatically underlined how the traditional players in the book business have been upended. Only Amazon, led by Mr. Bezos, seems to have a plan. He is executing it with a skill that infuriates his competitors and rewards his stockholders.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘We’re at a moment when cultural power is passing to new gatekeepers,’’ said Joe Esposito, a publishing consultant. ‘‘Heaven forbid that we should have the government telling our entrepreneurs what to do, but there is a social policy issue here. We don’t want the companies to become a black hole that absorbs all light except their own.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Apple case, which was brought by the Justice Department, will have little immediate effect on the selling of books. The publishers settled long ago, protesting that they had done nothing wrong but saying they could not afford to fight the government. But it might be a long time before they try to take charge of their fate again in such a bold fashion. Drawing the attention of the government once was bad enough; twice could be a disaster.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘The Department of Justice has unwittingly caused further consolidation in the industry at a time when consolidation is not necessarily a good thing,’’ said Mark Coker, the chief executive of Smashwords, an e-book distributor. ‘‘If you want a vibrant ecosystem of multiple publishers, multiple publishing methods and multiple successful retailers in 5, 20 or 50 years, we took a step backwards this week.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Some in publishing suspected that Amazon had prompted the U.S. government to file its lawsuit. The retailer has denied it, but it still emerged the big winner. While Apple will be punished — damages are yet to be decided — and the publishers were chastened, Amazon is left free to exert its dominance over e-books — even as it gains market share with physical books. The retailer declined to comment Wednesday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Amazon is not in most of the headlines, but all of the big events in the book world are about Amazon,’’ said Paul Aiken, executive director of the Authors Guild. ‘‘If the publishers colluded, it was to blunt Amazon’s dominance. Barnes &amp; Noble’s troubles may stem from a misstep with its Nook tablets, just as Borders’s bankruptcy might have been hastened by management mistakes, but its precarious position is that of any rent-paying retailer facing a deep-pocketed virtual competitor.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Last week, Penguin and Random House officially merged, creating a publishing behemoth that might be able to determine its future rather than suffer the fate of Barnes &amp; Noble, a once-swaggering entity that now seems adrift. Random House was not a target of the Justice Department; Penguin was.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Penguin and Random House were innovators who made paperbacks into a disruptive force in the 1940s and 1950s. They were the Amazons of their era, making the traditional book business deeply uneasy. No less an authority than George Orwell thought paperbacks were of so much better value than hardbacks that they spelled the ruination of publishing and bookselling. ‘‘The cheaper books become,’’ he wrote, ‘‘the less money is spent on books.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Orwell was wrong, but the same arguments are being made against Amazon and e-books today. Amazon executives are not much for public debate, but they argue that all this disruption will ultimately give more money to more authors and make books more widely available at cheaper prices, and who could argue with any of that?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That was not a prospect that many on Wednesday were putting much faith in.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon, its detractors argue, is not a nonprofit organization or a public trust but a hard-nosed company with investors who hope it will make lots of money someday soon. Its shares closed Wednesday at a record high of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">$292.33 and were heading for another record Thursday, up 2 percent to $298.25 in afternoon trading in New York.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The Justice Department’s guns seem pointed in the wrong direction,’’ Mr. Aiken said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But the more pressing concern for the industry is the fate of Barnes &amp; Noble. When the book retailer Borders collapsed two years ago, analysts said there was an unexpected consequence to the loss of 400 stores: the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">e-book growth rate began to taper off, as readers could no longer examine new titles before ordering them from Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">E-books, in other words, were not a magical technology that could shed all the existing infrastructure of publishing. They needed the bookstores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘If all of those corporate outlets vanish, there is suddenly a hell of a lot less space devoted to showcasing a large number of titles,’’ said J.B. Dickey, owner of the Seattle Mystery Bookshop. ‘‘We’ll probably see a continuing shrinking in print runs, maybe fewer titles published, fewer authors published and the New York houses retreating into the known best-sellers.

Apple says it will appeal the decision.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Second, Barnes &amp; Noble’s chief executive, William Lynch, has resigned. He was appointed in March 2010 to lead the bookseller into the high-tech age (he had been an executive at Palm and Home Shopping Network). But sales haven’t been going well with Barnes &amp; Noble, electronically or otherwise.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nooks-specs-are-exaggerated-again/" class="s1" target="_blank">I’ve had my clashes with Mr. Lynch. Twice, I’ve publicly called out the company for cheating in the way it advertised its Nook e-readers. Once, </a><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nooks-specs-are-exaggerated-again/" class="a" target="_blank">it understated the Nook’s weight</a><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nooks-specs-are-exaggerated-again/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nooks-specs-are-exaggerated-again/" class="s1" target="_blank">by an ounce. Another time, </a><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nooks-specs-are-exaggerated-again/" class="a" target="_blank">it advertised a</a><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nooks-specs-are-exaggerated-again/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nooks-specs-are-exaggerated-again/" class="a" target="_blank">Nook</a><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nooks-specs-are-exaggerated-again/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nooks-specs-are-exaggerated-again/" class="s1" target="_blank">to have a high-definition screen when it didn’t.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“Look, Barnes. Listen, Noble,” I wrote. “You have a perfectly good product. You don’t have to stretch the truth to sell it.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Lynch called me up, deeply upset, to ask if I had some kind of ax to grind with Barnes &amp; Noble (I didn’t, and don’t). But in both cases, he did order the advertising changed to correct the misleading specs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But his departure, I suspect, has to do with the failure of the Nook over all. According to the research firm IDC, Barnes &amp; Noble’s tablet market share wasn’t even in the top five for the first three months of this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Last week, Barnes &amp; Noble said that it would stop making color Nook tablets. That’s it: Amazon won that battle, and has no more competition.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">(Barnes &amp; Noble says that the color tablets will be “co-branded with yet-to-be-announced third-party manufacturers of consumer electronics products,” whatever that means. Barnes &amp; Noble will still design and sell the black-and-white tablets, like the Nook SimpleTouch and Glowlight.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">It’s really too bad. The color Nooks were easily competitive with Amazon’s Kindle Fire — better in many ways. The color Nooks could run any Android app, not just a handpicked special selection. They have memory-card slots so you can expand the storage.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-33153_7-57591141-10391733/does-it-still-make-sense-to-buy-a-nook-hd/" class="s1" target="_blank">In fact, </a><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-33153_7-57591141-10391733/does-it-still-make-sense-to-buy-a-nook-hd/" class="a" target="_blank">CNET argues</a> <span style=" color: #000;">that there’s never been a better time to buy a color Nook, since the company has slashed the prices. At the moment, they cost far less than Amazon’s equivalent Kindle: $130 for the 7-inch model (Amazon’s is $170), $150 for the 9-incher (Amazon’s is $270).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The problem, of course, is the copy protection. Idiotically, each tech giant in the e-book game (Apple, Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble) developed a different, incompatible form of copy protection for its books. Once Barnes &amp; Noble drops out of the game completely, any e-books you bought for your Nook will probably become unreadable.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Betamaxed, you might say.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.the-digital-reader.com/2013/06/11/its-official-bn-has-ended-support-for-nook-pc-mac-apps/" class="s1" target="_blank">(Yes, there are Nook apps for Mac and Windows, but </a><a href="http://www.the-digital-reader.com/2013/06/11/its-official-bn-has-ended-support-for-nook-pc-mac-apps/" class="a" target="_blank">Barnes &amp; Noble abandoned them</a> <span style=" color: #000;">some time ago. There’s also a way to read these books on a Web page, but it doesn’t work for many e-book titles. The company still has a Windows 8 app that can read its books.)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">So the bottom line is all bad news. People who bought e-books from Barnes &amp; Noble may wind up with libraries they can’t read. Amazon no longer has a competitor to keep it on its toes (and its prices low). The future of Barnes &amp; Noble’s e-book business now looks murky, which means that even more customers will stay away, creating a vicious cycle of declining sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the end, it may be that all we can salvage from this smoking mess is a lesson or two — although what they might be escapes me at the moment.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/reselling-e-books-and-the-one-penny-problem/">Reselling E-Books and the One-Penny Problem</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/nooks-advertising-is-corrected/">Nook’s Advertising Is Corrected</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/how-compatible-are-rival-e-readers/">How Compatible Are Rival E-Readers?</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nooks-specs-are-exaggerated-again/" class="a" target="_blank">Nook’s Specs Are Exaggerated, </a><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nooks-specs-are-exaggerated-again/" target="_blank">Again</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">Amazon Lights the Fire With Free Books<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020130711e97b00232</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_059.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark112">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark113">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Daily Report: Apple Ruling Strengthens Amazon’s Powerful Hand</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">286 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">11 July 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Tony Hsieh didn’t look much like a modern-day Bugsy Siegel. Wearing backpack, T-shirt and jeans, standing outside a downtown bar, he patrolled his future empire along East Fremont Street here one sweltering morning.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But the flamboyant Siegel changed this city for good when he built the Flamingo Hotel, the first luxury casino on the Strip. Now Mr. Hsieh, a soft-spoken 39-year-old Internet billionaire who runs Zappos, the online clothing store, plans to do something as transformative. It’s a classic American dream: a Western-scale roll of the dice in a city that suddenly conjured up Belle Époque Paris and ancient Rome out of the desert. The idea this time is to build a version of the Mission district in San Francisco or the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in downtown Vegas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Hsieh is relocating Zappos headquarters from Henderson, Nevada, about 16 miles away, or 25 kilometers, and investing hundreds of millions of his dollars to retrofit downtown with, well, a downtown, in line with the latest trends.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">There is not much to see yet, but his $350 million Downtown Project — a mix of investments, acquisitions and loans — envisions blocks and blocks of pedestrian-friendly, small-business-oriented, high-density, high-tech urbanism in long-depressed and troubled neighborhoods. Zappos will take over the decrepit old City Hall. That gesture alone, salvaging a local landmark, has endeared Mr. Hsieh to many here.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Downtown Project also will seed tech start-ups, boutiques, mom-and-pop restaurants and bars; the world’s largest Airstream trailer park; a playground and geodesic dome; a complex of recording studios; a charter school; a doggy day care; a bike share program; a Tesla electric car share; and theaters for TED Talk-like lecturers and music festivals.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">There’s no designer-led master plan, no single billion-dollar construction project, no star architect. The concept is top-down but preaches piecemeal, bottom-up development and reuse. It exploits a picturesque supply of abandoned flop houses, vacant offices and collapsing warehouses, capitalizing on a growing desire among young Americans for urban life: an anti-Strip vision of America.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Out on the Strip, MGM opened CityCenter in 2009, a $7.8 billion luxury development and celebrity-architect petting zoo, which in a sense is the same concept, but pegged as a theme park for tourists. It’s a smart and sleek attraction; business has been improving. CityCenter and the Downtown Project are both visions for evolving the same city.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But unlike MGM’s development, which opened in the midst of the housing collapse, Mr. Hsieh’s timing could hardly have been better. The local economy, devastated when the bubble burst, is limping back. The population (increasingly young Asians and Hispanics) keeps rising, and wealthy out-of-towners prop up the high end of the housing market. Most properties are still under water, and the city is down 100,000 construction jobs from</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">pre-recession highs, but the picture isn’t as bleak, or straightforward, as four years ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">At the same time, Las Vegas suffers the pitfalls of being a one-industry town. Baked into its economy are minimal taxes and a state government inclined to ship much of what Las Vegas contributes to the rest of Nevada, which, among other consequences, insures the school system is perennially poor.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Casino moguls, needing a steady supply of parking attendants, hotel maids and blackjack dealers, not</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">college-educated workers, were once fine with that. But times are changing. Now the lack of good public schools</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">and downtown amenities — demanded by those mobile and educated young Americans other cities are competing to attract — has become a liability.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On top of which, Las Vegans young and old complained about not having ‘‘authentic places,’’ which are ‘‘locally owned, one of a kind, less corporate,’’ as Tyler Jones, a 35-year-old architect-developer of luxury homes and third-generation Las Vegan, put it. They wanted a Las Vegas for Las Vegans.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Which is where Mr. Hsieh comes in.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Downtown began to decline by the 1960s. The casinos, department stores and middle-class homeowners fled south to the Strip, seizing upon cheap and plentiful land.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the 1990s, the Fremont Experience turned five desperate blocks of what used to be the heart of the downtown gambling scene into a pedestrian concourse beneath a lighted canopy that pulled in low-end tourists but few jobs or residents. It’s now a blighted attraction. Neonopolis arrived in 2002, a retail and entertainment mall, which soon went belly up, leaving a fortress-size hole amid the pawn shops and homeless shelters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Since then, there has been progress. The Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, designed by Frank Gehry, opened downtown in 2010; the popular Smith Center for the Performing Arts, a $485 million project, last year; along with a new City Hall. And back in 2007, a small bohemian speakeasy called the Downtown Cocktail Room opened on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Boulevard, once the main intersection.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Hanging out in the Cocktail Room a few years ago, Mr. Hsieh began to picture a different vision for the neighborhood: as an affordable locus for upscale young adults, having little or nothing to do with gambling.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In some ways, the most fascinating aspect of this vision is the relocation of Zappos. Moving its headquarters downtown represents a pointed alternative to the multibillion-dollar suburban office parks that Google and Apple are building in Silicon Valley, notwithstanding that so many of their own employees want to live in, and commute from, San Francisco. Mr. Hsieh has bought into the solid notion that chance encounters on the street or at a club</p><ul id="l4"><li><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">urban collisions — spark innovation: cities, inherently, nurture the economy and culture.</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It’s a gentrifying idea that comes at the cost of displacing some existing businesses whose owners say downtown Las Vegas wasn’t a blank slate. Critics like Joel Kotkin, a fellow of Urban Futures at Chapman University, have told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that Mr. Hsieh’s project commits tax dollars (by, for instance, helping finance Zappos’s purchase of the old City Hall) that might otherwise be spent on training programs or buses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But then there’s Eat. It’s the antithesis of the celebrity chef chains on the Strip — more like some neighborhood hot spot you’d stumble across in Austin, Texas. Natalie Young, the chef and owner, having grown tired of her job on the Strip, opened the place with a no-interest $225,000 loan from the Downtown Project. When she fell behind on her apartment rent, according to The Review-Journal, she called Michael Cornthwaite, a friend, who owns the Cocktail Room. His wife showed up at Ms. Young’s door with a check. Eat has since been hopping. That story encapsulates the sort of communal entrepreneurship that Mr. Hsieh hopes to inspire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">I toured the East Fremont district with Don Welch, one of Mr. Hsieh’s partners, who talked in the dreamy, assured way developers do about filling blocks and blocks of vacant land in the next few years with a bustle of businesses and people.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">We’ll see. Short term, success depends on Mr. Hsieh’s running the table, investment-wise. A range of business leaders, local converts to civic diversification, not just from the gambling industry, hopes he does.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Long term, success will depend on a broader vision, which incorporates downtown casinos that have reinvested in themselves, like the El Cortez, along with establishments that haven’t. And new development will need to be integrated with existing schools, homeless shelters and convenience stores, so the city doesn’t simply end up with an isolated hipster office park.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">That Caesars Entertainment on the Strip is also retrofitting urban-style streetscapes for tourists suggests Mr. Hsieh’s project is making some waves. It’s in contrast to the marooned, star-architect-driven mega-developments like the Smith Center, which are, so far, poorly knitted into the fabric of downtown streets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Mr. Hsieh isn’t himself thinking in terms of new architecture yet. He’s repurposing vernacular buildings, though the project, in its open-endedness, would seem to present an opportunity for resourceful architects to pitch the virtues of inventive new design.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Hard as it may be not to feel skeptical, the small-scale civic principles are solid. And sometimes a single determined mogul is just what a struggling city needs.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">It wouldn’t be the first time that Las Vegas was remade by one.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">William Lynch Jr., the chief executive of Barnes &amp; Noble, resigned on Monday, two weeks after a devastating earnings report that accentuated the bookseller&#39;s losing battle against powerful rivals like Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Lynch&#39;s departure was part of a series of sweeping changes the company announced as it tries to regain its footing after a failed initiative to build up its Nook division and compete in the increasingly crowded market for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">e-readers. When it revealed its fourth-quarter earnings late last month, Barnes &amp; Noble said it would cease making its own color tablets, an acknowledgment that they were lagging popular brands like Amazon&#39;s Kindle Fire and Apple&#39;s iPad.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Instead, the company said it would form partnerships with third parties to make the color devices, while it continued to make and sell its own black-and-white versions of the Nook.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In a statement late Monday, the company said that Michael P. Huseby had been appointed chief executive of the Nook division and president of Barnes &amp; Noble. Mr. Huseby has served as chief financial officer since joining Barnes &amp; Noble in March 2012; previously he held that position at Cablevision Systems, a media company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Max J. Roberts, the chief executive of the college division, will report to Mr. Huseby, while Mr. Huseby and Mitchell S. Klipper, the chief executive for the retail stores, will report to Leonard Riggio, the company&#39;s chairman.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The moves on Monday appeared to be a step toward separating the digital and retail divisions, as the company has indicated it might do. Barnes &amp; Noble has been in talks over a potential sale of its digital assets, as well as its 675 bookstores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Microsoft is one potential buyer of the Nook business; last year it invested hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire 17.6 percent of the division.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Riggio has expressed interest in taking back ownership of the physical stores that make Barnes &amp; Noble the largest bookstore chain in the country. Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &amp; Noble, declined to provide an update on that offer.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There was no indication that a new chief executive would be named.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Because the company is in a transition period, we have no immediate plans to name a C.E.O.,&#39;&#39; Ms. Keating said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We thank William Lynch for helping transform Barnes &amp; Noble into a leading digital content provider and for leading in the development of our award-winning line of Nook products,&#39;&#39; Mr. Riggio said in a statement issued Monday. &#39;&#39;As the bookselling industry continues to undergo significant transformation, we believe that Michael, Mitchell and Max are the right executives to lead us into the future.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter underscored the urgency of the need to take action. The Nook unit showed a $177 million loss in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, more than doubling the loss from the period a year earlier. Sales fell 34 percent, to $108 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The signs have been ominous for the company since the beginning of the year, when it announced that sales for the nine-week holiday period in late 2012 had declined at both its bookstores and in the Nook unit.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Lynch joined Barnes &amp; Noble in February 2009, with no previous experience in bookselling. He was executive vice president for marketing at HSN.com and also worked for Gifts.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">At the time, his arrival was hailed as a forward-thinking move, since Mr. Lynch, a Texas native, was only 39 years old and fluent in e-commerce and technology. Within months, Barnes &amp; Noble introduced its first Nook e-reader.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">To publishers, Mr. Lynch had performed a temporary miracle, helping create a product that provided a welcome competitor to Amazon&#39;s Kindle, which dominated the market and offered e-books at a relatively inexpensive price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Nook was initially successful, drawing critical praise and capturing consumers who were uneasy about buying an e-reader -- at the time a brand-new device -- online, without testing it out in person. Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s hundreds of retail stores allowed potential customers to see and touch what they were buying.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But even though Barnes &amp; Noble quickly gained a sizable piece of the e-book market, it was not enough to ward off Amazon. And as black-and-white e-readers gave way to multifunctional color tablets, Barnes &amp; Noble found itself competing unsuccessfully against companies many times its size, like Amazon and Apple, that have had technology in their DNA from the start.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As chief executive, Mr. Lynch worked from the company&#39;s Ninth Avenue office in Manhattan, across town from the Fifth Avenue building where Mr. Riggio keeps his office. Mr. Lynch threw his energies into the digital side of the business, taking far less of an interest in the retail stores, and frequently flew to Palo Alto to build up Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s presence in Silicon Valley, where their e-readers are designed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mike Shatzkin, the founder and chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a publishing consultant, said a split of the business could help stave off the company&#39;s decline.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The Nook business clearly is going to need some global investment to have any kind of chance at all, and it certainly looks possible that they will be better off separate than together,&#39;&#39; Mr. Shatzkin said. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a glide path to oblivion, and you can affect the speed of the decline. Nobody&#39;s going to bring back a robust brick-and-mortar book business.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">William Lynch resigned as chief, and was not replaced.

A.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Android has become the dominant mobile operating system around the world, and like Windows before it, malware writers typically target the most commonly used platform in hopes of snaring the most victims. Not all phones can run the latest, more secure versions of the Android system, which can make them more vulnerable to malicious apps. Third-party app sites help spread malicious software as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Common sense and a discerning eye can help keep your device safe. If you want to avoid malicious apps, get new software from trusted sources like the Google Play store or Amazon’s Android app store — and avoid installing any apps from random third-party sites.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2012/02/android-and-security.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Although it does not make developers go through a formal approval process when submitting new apps, Google does </a><a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2012/02/android-and-security.html" class="a" target="_blank">automatically scan apps</a> <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/google-removes-32-apps-google-play-over-malware-concerns" class="s1" target="_blank">that are added to its Google Play store for malware. The company has also </a><a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/google-removes-32-apps-google-play-over-malware-concerns" class="a" target="_blank">withdrawn bad apps</a> <span style=" color: #000;">that have wormed their way into the store.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Sticking with apps from well-known developers or apps that have been professionally reviewed can help keep you away from the junk and scam programs that may have made it into the store. (Badly written or spammy apps are a universal problem and Apple’s App Store has plenty of those, too.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Even when shopping in the Google Play store, you should thoroughly check out an app before installing it. Be wary of apps that seem to have a lot of downloads and high ratings — but a minimal amount of written reviews — since a scammer may be trying to get attention. You can also check the app’s Permissions tab on the Google Play page to see what parts of your Android phone or tablet it wants to use, and then avoid apps that look too invasive.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.av-test.org/en/tests/mobile-devices/android/" class="s1" target="_blank">If you like to visit third-party app sites, you may want to consider installing </a><a href="http://www.av-test.org/en/tests/mobile-devices/android/" class="a" target="_blank">mobile security software</a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lookout&amp;hl=en" class="s1" target="_blank">from a reliable company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Jim Hollock’s first book, a true-crime tale set in Pennsylvania, got strong reviews and decent sales when it appeared in 2011. Now, the book, ‘‘Born to Lose,’’ is losing momentum — yet Amazon.com, to the writer’s intense frustration, has increased the price by nearly a third.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘At this point, people need an inducement,’’ said Mr. Hollock, a retired corrections official. ‘‘But instead of lowering the price, Amazon is raising it.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Other writers and publishers have the same complaint. They say Amazon, which became the biggest force in bookselling by discounting so heavily it often lost money, has been cutting back on its deals for scholarly and small press books. That creates the uneasy prospect of a two-tier system in which some books are priced beyond the reach of an audience.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">There is no way to track the movement of prices on Amazon, so the evidence is anecdotal and fragmentary. But books are among the few consumer items that still have prices printed on them. Any Amazon customer who uses the retailer’s ‘‘Saved for Later’’ basket has noticed that its prices have all the permanence of plane fares. No explanation is ever given for why a price has changed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Bruce Joshua Miller, president of Miller Trade Book Marketing, a Chicago firm representing university and independent presses, said he recently surveyed 18 publishers. ‘‘Fourteen responded and said Amazon had over the last few years either lowered discounts on scholarly books or, in the case of older or slow-selling titles, completely eliminated them,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon says it is not belatedly trying to improve its anemic profit margins.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘We are actually lowering prices,’’ said Sarah Gelman, an Amazon spokeswoman. ‘‘We pay for these price decreases with relentless focus on improving our execution — and this commitment to low prices is one of the reasons our print books business continues to grow.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Offered a list of random titles whose discounts had dropped, she said she would not talk about specific books. They included David Foster Wallace’s essay on John McCain, which went to 10 percent off from 20 percent. Ellen Galinsky’s ‘‘Mind in the Making’’ went to 24 percent off from 32 percent. Jim Harrison’s ‘‘Songs of Unreason’’ dropped to 16 percent off from 32 percent. Higher prices have implications beyond annoyed authors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">For all the hoopla around e-books, old-fashioned printed volumes are still a bigger business. Amazon sells about one in four printed books in the United States, according to industry estimates, a level of market domination with little precedent in the book trade.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It is an achievement built on superior customer service, a vast range of titles and, most of all, rock-bottom prices that no physical store could hope to match. As Amazon became one of the largest retailers in the United States, it never seemed interested in charging enough to make a profit. Customers celebrated and the competition languished.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Now — with traditional U.S. book retailers like Borders dead, Barnes &amp; Noble struggling, and independent booksellers greatly diminished — for many consumers there is simply no other way to get many books than through Amazon. And for some books, Amazon is, in effect, beginning to raise prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Stephen Blake Mettee, chairman of the board of the Independent Book Publishers Association, said Amazon was simply following in the tradition of any large company that gains control of a market. ‘‘You lower your prices until the competition is out of the picture, and then you raise your prices and get your money back,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Authors like Mr. Hollock say they feel helpless about Amazon’s control. Mr. Hollock says he has called Amazon several times to ask why the price of his book was going up and has never received an answer that made sense.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In its 16 years as a public company, Amazon has received rare permission from Wall Street to concentrate on expanding its infrastructure, increasing revenue at the expense of profit. Stockholders have pushed Amazon shares up to a record level, even though the company makes only pocket change. Profits were always promised tomorrow.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Small publishers wonder whether tomorrow is finally here, and they are the ones who will pay for it.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Curt Matthews, chief executive of Independent Publishers Group, a Chicago book distributor that got into a dispute with Amazon last year over margins on e-books, speculated that Amazon could be data-mining its customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘They are wondering, ‘If we knock off only 10 percent as opposed to 35 percent, where do we come out ahead?’’’ Mr. Matthews said. ‘‘They don’t care how many books they sell, they want to know how many dollars they get.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">For Mr. Hollock, the ‘‘Born to Lose’’ author, the issue is readers, not dollars. His award-winning book, published by Kent State University Press, had a steep list price of $35 to begin with. In the author’s view, Amazon is simply compounding the trouble by raising its price to more than $30 from $23.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘I see all these other books out there that are cheaper,’’ Mr. Hollock said. ‘‘I thought, ‘Man alive, I don’t know how I’m going to compete.’’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130705e9760003t</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_066.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark126">A</a><a name="bookmark127">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">DOWNTOWN VIBE IS LATEST VISION FOR LAS VEGAS</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">74 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">5 July 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Amazon.com story is remarkable. Within living memory, bookselling was a local activity. A major city would have two or three large independent stores selling new books and other large, scruffier stores selling secondhand books. Paperbacks would receive wide if uneven circulation on bus station and drugstore racks. It was not a perfect system, but it had the advantage of being diffuse and thus hard to control. The hippie, black and women’s movements of the 1960s would not have been so successful in challenging authority without the bookstores, which made their ideas widely available and sympathetic in a way that television, for instance, did not.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">That transmission system has now been largely dismantled, killed by high rents and new technology. With little discussion, Amazon has skillfully absorbed a large part of the book trade. It sells about one in four new books, and the vast number of independent sellers on its site increases its market share even more. It owns as a separate entity the largest secondhand book network, Abebooks. And of course it has a majority of the e-book market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The company is a marvel in many ways. You can get almost any print book you want, by the end of the week! And Amazon will pay the postage! For book lovers, it was a dream come true. Amazon presents itself as less a company and more a public utility. One of its greatest accomplishments is the way it has made the future of bookselling seem as if it will inevitably be owned by Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One consequence of this shift is that soon no one will know what a book’s “real” price is. Price will be determined by demand and perhaps by whim. The first seeds of this can be seen in the Justice Department’s suit against the leading publishers, who felt that Amazon was pricing their e-books so low that it threatened their viability. The government accused the publishers of colluding to raise prices in an anti-consumer move. Amazon was not a party to the case, but it emerged the big winner.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/business/as-competition-wanes-amazon-cuts-back-its-discounts.html?src=me&amp;ref=general" class="s1" target="_blank">Perhaps as a result, the question of how Amazon prices books is now a radioactive topic with some publishers. While reporting </a>my article in Friday’s New York Times<span class="p">, I tried to ask the University of Chicago Press why Amazon seemed to be cutting discounts on its books, effectively making them more expensive and thus possibly less salable. Laura Avey, promotions manager, replied: “This just isn’t something that anyone here is going to be able to comment on. Pricing questions involve proprietary information, and we just aren’t able to share that.”</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cotton-Tenants-Families-James-Agee/dp/1612192122/ref%3Dsr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373042262&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=James%2BAgee" class="s1" target="_blank">One of the few publishers willing to speak his mind about Amazon is Dennis Loy Johnson, proprietor of the Melville House, one of the most interesting new presses since its founding in 2001. Melville had an immediate hit last month with a rediscovered article by James Agee,</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cotton-Tenants-Families-James-Agee/dp/1612192122/ref%3Dsr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373042262&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=James%2BAgee" class="a" target="_blank"> “Cotton Tenants.”</a> <span style=" color: #000;">But as sales slow in the days since publication, Amazon is charging more for it.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://camelcamelcamel.com/Cotton-Tenants-Families-James-Agee/product/1612192122" class="s1" target="_blank">The price-tracking site </a>camelcamelcamel shows “Cotton Tenants,” <span class="p">which lists for $24.95, moving from $16 on Amazon shortly after publication to $19.79 last week before falling back slightly to the current $19.23. If you were a few weeks late getting the news about “Cotton Tenants,” you paid 20 percent more.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But it is still cheaper than the neighborhood bookstore, assuming of course there is one left. Right?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“I don’t like the fact that there’s one retailer able to so massively underprice other retailers, especially in a business that so desperately needs more retailers,” Mr. Johnson said. “And I don’t like the inconsistency of the pricing, either — the raising, the lowering — because it sends a confusing message that good books are worth less, and because it encourages buying based on something other than the quality of the book. It’s just an</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">unhealthy business if people are buying a thing mostly because of its price, not its quality. That’s how you sell widgets, not books.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“Discounting, and especially inconsistent or shifting discounting, really messes with a publisher’s ability to price a book fairly and accurately to its cost,” he added. “You have to consider the fact that whatever price you put on the cover, Amazon is going to reduce it by as much as half — unless they don’t — or they may, but only for a while. But in short they’re going to make your book look like a thing with a cost lower than the one you placed on it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“So do you raise the price, knowing they’re going to lower it, so that the price will then appear closer to what you need it to be? But if you do that then you’re screwing the more honest retailers who can’t discount. And we’ve gotten a long way from recognition of the fact that publishers have costs in making books, and that should have something to do with the price.”</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/apple-and-netflix-dominate-online-video/" class="a" target="_blank">Apple and Netflix Dominate Online </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/apple-and-netflix-dominate-online-video/" target="_blank">Video</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/amazons-diminishing-discounts/">Amazon’s Diminishing Discounts</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/26/amazon-starts-a-shopping-site-for-the-environmental-crowd/">Amazon Starts a Shopping Site for the Environmental Crowd</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/questions-for-amazon-on-privacy-and-the-kindle-fire/">Questions for Amazon on Privacy and the Kindle Fire</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/inside-amazons-very-hot-warehouse/">Inside Amazon’s Very Hot Warehouse</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Jim Hollock’s first book, “Born to Lose,” has been losing momentum, yet Amazon has increased the price by nearly a third. | Jeff Swensen for The New York Times | Jim Hollock’s first book, “Born to Lose,” has been losing momentum, yet Amazon has increased the price by nearly a third. | Jeff Swensen for The New York Times</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020130705e975002jp</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_068.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark130">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark131">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Technology Workers Are Young (Really Young)</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By QUENTIN HARDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">767 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">5 July 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s well known that technology is a young man’s game. Still, it is surprising to see just how young (and how male).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">PayScale, a company based in Seattle, has determined that the median age of workers at many of the most successful companies in the technology industry, along with information on gender and years of experience.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Just six of the 32 companies it looked at had a median age greater than 35 years old. Eight of the companies, the study said, had median employee age of 30 or younger. Women were generally less than 30 percent of the work force, and in fields like semiconductors, represented much less than that.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/industry_age.htm" class="s1" target="_blank">While the results may affirm a widely held hunch, they are nonetheless striking: </a><a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/industry_age.htm" class="a" target="_blank">According to</a> <span style=" color: #000;">the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the overall median age of American workers is 42.3 years old. The company with the oldest workers on the PayScale list, Hewlett – Packard, came in at 41 years.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The other five companies with older workers, in descending order of median age, were I.B.M. Global Services (38 years old), Oracle (38), Nokia (36), Dell (37) and Sony (36).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The seven companies with the youngest workers, ranked from youngest to highest in median age, were Epic Games (26); Facebook (28); Zynga (28); Google (29); and AOL, Blizzard Entertainment, InfoSys, and Monster.com (all 30). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only shoe stores and restaurants have workers with a median age less than 30.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Median age means that an equal number of workers are above and below the figure. In large populations, the number is considered representative. PayScale, which surveys many industries, says it covers 3 percent of the American work force, an amount that could yield meaningful results. In this survey, some 21,700 company employees submitted information.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Not surprisingly, the companies with older workers tend to be older companies, because some people still stay with one employer for many years, and over time a company may accumulate more of these people. Cisco Systems has a median worker age of 35, and both Samsung and Microsoft come in at 34. These companies also tend to have workers with a lot more experience.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Younger companies tend to have workers with less time at the firm, which is partly an effect of being new and hiring intensively in recent years. Facebook’s median worker has been with the company just 1.1 years, while Intel, I.B.M., Oracle and others come in around six years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Other factors are also in play, however. “The firms that are growing or innovating around new areas tend to have younger workers,” said Katie Bardaro, the lead economist at PayScale. “Older companies that aren’t changing with the times get older workers.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One reason for this, she said, was a function of skills. “Baby Boomers and Gen Xers tend to know C# and SQL,” she said. C# is a software language, while SQL is a database technology. She added, “Gen Y knows Python, social media, and Hadoop,” which are newer versions of those things.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon.com, notably, has a median stay with the company of just one year, a figure Ms. Bardaro ascribed to the intense pace of work there. (The study did not include workers in Amazon’s warehouses, where skills and turnover are different.) “We’re based in Seattle, and know a lot of people at Amazon,” she said. “The consensus is that you are run through a gamut there, make money, burn out and leave.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The survey was derived from information PayScale gets from individuals who come to PayScale seeking employment information, and volunteer their data to share information from others. PayScale, which works with LinkedIn, sells its data to human resources departments. Ms. Bardaro said her company had also backed up the information with third-party data, to confirm the numbers.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/a-software-feud-ends-at-least-for-today/">A Software Feud Ends, at Least for Today</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/oracle-and-salesforce-a-data-sharing-deal/" class="a" target="_blank">Oracle and Salesforce: a Data-Sharing </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/oracle-and-salesforce-a-data-sharing-deal/" target="_blank">Deal</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/google-asks-secret-court-for-permission-to-publish-national-security-request-data/">Google Asks Secret Court for Permission to Publish National Security Request Data</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/i-b-m-inflates-its-cloud/">I.B.M.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble conceded on Tuesday that it cannot compete head-to-head with the iPad and the Kindle Fire.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Reporting a big loss at its Nook e-reader division that dragged down the company&#39;s fourth-quarter results, Barnes &amp; Noble said that it would no longer make its own color tablets. Instead, it will work with third parties, which will make the devices in exchange for co-branding opportunities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The announcement is essentially Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s white flag, signaling that it cannot compete in a market dominated by Apple, Amazon.com and Samsung. It will still make and sell the black-and-white versions of the Nook, which generate the majority of the company&#39;s digital book sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company plans to discount its remaining Nook tablets through the holidays.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Our aim is to sell great tablets connected to our best content catalog and high-quality bookstore services we&#39;ve done, but do so without the sizable upfront risk,&#39;&#39; William J. Lynch Jr., Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s chief executive, said on a call with analysts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The development raises questions about what lies ahead for the embattled bookseller, which remains under pressure from better-financed digital rivals like Amazon. The company&#39;s loss of $2.11 a share exceeded the average analyst estimate of 99 cents, according to data from Capital IQ. Revenue decreased 7.4 percent, to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">$1.28 billion, while the net loss was $118.6 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Company executives were silent about talks with Leonard S. Riggio, Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s chairman, who has sought to buy the chain&#39;s 675 stores. Nor did they discuss the state of talks with Microsoft, an investor in the Nook business that had shown interest in buying the division&#39;s digital assets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Talks about possible transactions were still continuing, according to a person briefed on the matter, though it was unclear if or when a deal would be reached. Barnes &amp; Noble has indicated that it will not part with its core retail stores for anything less than $1 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Though the company&#39;s latest results gave investors heartburn -- shares in Barnes &amp; Noble tumbled 17 percent Tuesday, to $15.61 -- stopping some of the red ink in the Nook unit may help stabilize the business and make it more attractive to potential suitors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">And the company can still point to its inventory of digital books as its single most valuable asset, which may draw possible buyers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But the outsourcing of the device manufacturing reflects the difficulties for Barnes &amp; Noble in refashioning itself more in the Apple mold.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Introduced in 2009, the Nook was meant to help usher the company into the Internet media age, allowing it to compete head-to-head with Amazon in both devices and digital books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The next year, Barnes &amp; Noble took the even riskier step of introducing a color tablet, the Nook Color, that was aimed more at competing with the iPad. The company introduced ever more sophisticated models, including a 9-inch high-definition tablet.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Such was the promise of the Nook that it drew in both Microsoft and the British publisher Pearson, which together bought 23 percent of the business and valued it at about $1.8 billion. And several Nook tablets have won higher praise from reviewers than their Kindle rivals.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">That has not translated into sales, and the division meant to revive Barnes &amp; Noble has instead weighed down the rest of the company. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the Nook unit lost $177 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, more than doubling the loss from the period a year earlier. Sales fell 34 percent, to $108 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The company has also had to grapple with the high costs of manufacturing its own devices. Unsold tablets accounted for a $133 million write-down in the fourth quarter and $222 million for the entire 2013 fiscal year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Lynch outlined some of the expenses involved in supporting its tablet business to analysts. Not only was the company responsible for the hardware, it also invested in developing the software and in marketing the devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s physical bookstores have not fared much better. Fourth-quarter Ebitda at the company&#39;s retail arm fell 24 percent, to $51 million, while revenue declined 10 percent, to $948 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One sign of the company&#39;s troubles: the fourth quarter suffered in comparison to the year-ago period, which reaped huge benefits from sales of &#39;&#39;The Hunger Games&#39;&#39; and the &#39;&#39;Fifty Shades of Grey&#39;&#39; trilogies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Lynch told analysts that while the company opened two retail stores last year, it closed 18. Barnes &amp; Noble will open five locations this year, but will close 15 to 20 existing ones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One brighter spot for Barnes &amp; Noble was its college bookstore business, which had $3.8 million in Ebitda for the quarter on $252 million in revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble will still make and sell the black-and-white versions of the Nook.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the most influential companies in high technology right now may be a 135-year-old industrial stalwart.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On Tuesday, General Electric announced software for what it calls &#39;&#39;the Industrial Internet,&#39;&#39; which means the use of sensors, networking technology, and data analysis to better understand and use large industrial processes like electric power production. It is the latest step in G.E.&#39;s push to make the rest of the world&#39;s equipment and systems operate more like the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The rise of industrial big data is moving at twice the speed of other big data. That&#39;s a great opportunity.&#39;&#39; said William Ruh, the head of global software at G.E. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s all kinds of experiences that we&#39;re going to create.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One product was an enhanced data analysis framework, based on the Hadoop software used by Internet companies for Big Data analysis. Customers will use it to combine both historic and real-time information to build data-analysis applications to more efficiently manage industrial production.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The other is a kind of application software to help power companies figure out how to best build out and operate their turbines. By October, G.E. hopes to have similar applications out for railway, mining, and oil and gas companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">G.E. also announced it is working with Amazon Web Services, offering its products to industrial customers over that public cloud. The Hadoop-based product, Mr. Ruh said, was a first part of a much larger platform for data gathering and analysis that G.E. plans to construct and use both internally and with customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Effectively, G.E. is taking the data-driven tools and strategies used by Google and Facebook to the much larger global economy. What tracking cookies in a browser do for understanding what Web ads to put in front of you, a turbine rich with sensors and complimentary software will do for better operating an electrical grid.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">G.E. already manages more than 100 million data-gathering &#39;&#39;tags&#39;&#39; on its products, and foresees putting out far more than that while also collecting sensor data around the surrounding environment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">By 2020, GE figures, total spending on the Industrial Internet will be $23 billion. Better management of processes and understanding of systems will yield $1.279 trillion in value, the company said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">What G.E. does not yet have nailed is just how its new products will be used. The Hadoop-based analysis tool is for now tied to G.E. products, and the industrial application will be sold as its own product.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Late last year G.E. formed a joint venture with Accenture, called Taleris, designed to gather and analyze data from commercial aircraft, for airlines. More recently, G.E. invested $105 million in a company called Pivotal, which is building Industrial Internet software.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The different approaches may indicate how big and pervasive a business G.E. considers the Industrial Internet to be. Mr. Ruh called it &#39;&#39;one of G.E.&#39;s top priorities.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">G.E. is not the only company looking to make the rest of the world like a Web company. Cisco Systems is in the middle of an &#39;&#39;Internet of Everyhing&#39;&#39; strategy that involves selling software and services for a world rich in sensors. This is aimed more at things like traffic and water systems than manufacturing, however.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Also on Tuesday, Philips announced an open-source competition to speed its product innovation. Phillips is also offering data-gathering connectivity in both its health care and lighting products, hoping to boost the efficiency of things like a patient&#39;s medication adherence, or tuning lights to compliment the amount of available sunlight.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Everybody knows they&#39;ll need this technology, but they don&#39;t know exactly what they&#39;ll do with it yet,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Ruh. He was speaking about G.E.&#39;s customers, but he might also have been speaking about the companies connecting the world, and trying to figure out how best to profit.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the summer of 1984, two years before I was born, my father, Ajit Vikram Singh opened a small corner bookshop, Fact &amp; Fiction, in South Delhi’s Vasant Vihar area, opposite a decrepit cinema hall that would screen films like ‘The Sex Life of Animals’ to a packed audience. Nearly 30 years later, it’s disheartening to see him disillusioned with the Indian book industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A descendant of a royal family, my father was brought up in old, decadent fashions and with a pet elephant in the house. He got a degree in science from Delhi’s St Stephen’s College, but veered toward the art of curating, collecting, and making a life selling carefully selected books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">I grew up in a world unlike his, one filled with books. When I was a baby, he would carry me in a tiny basket to the bookstore. One day, he found me crawling on the floor and sinking my teeth on books lying on the floor. “You literally grew up biting into the word,” he chuckled.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the early 1990s, I would see my father diligently scan catalogues of international publishing houses, highlighting titles he wanted for the bookstore. He knew where a book in the store was kept because he would stack them himself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“A bookstore isn’t about keeping books you like to read,” he would say. “It’s about filling it with books that people will want to pick out and buy.” This was perhaps his first lesson in selling books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It was neither a luxurious nor a profitable trade, and my friends at school would wonder how my father managed to pay my school fee. My literary-minded colleagues, however, would imagine the store as a retreat filled with days of quiet reading and fancy thoughts of opening their own bookstores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">My father’s days at the bookstore are still punctuated by visits from a bewildering cast of characters, fewer than before. There will be sophisticated gentlemen seeking details of an international best seller; a hassled aunt wanting a birthday gift option for a prodigal niece seeking a “nice” book; a television celebrity hanging around the aisles, hoping to be recognized and drop names of writers she has interviewed; the vague intellectual who proffers instant dismissive reviews of books others pick out while he thumbs through another book he wouldn’t buy; and people with neither the recollection of the title nor the name of the publisher, yet persistently describing a book they want to purchase.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Over the years, I’ve watched my father become a solitary man who spends his days manning the store from a squeaky chair behind a tiny desk along with the help of a manager. He knows the regulars well — writers, scholars, journalists – who years ago walked into the store as awkward young men and have grown up to be people whose books found a place on his bookshelves.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">My father shares a unique rapport with them. He knows who reads graphic novels, he knows who seeks philosophy, and he knows who wants science fiction. There are some who make an annual pilgrimage to the bookshop, for whom he’ll disappear into the hidden attic, and fish out a book he has been saving for them. He would even read unpublished manuscripts. In a ruthless, brash city like Delhi, here was an independent bookstore where you could openly talk about literature, religion and politics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Over the years, my father has come to acquire a reputation of being an eccentric bookseller. A few Sundays ago, I was sharing a cup of coffee with him at the bookshop, when a man walked in and asked for the “self-help books” section.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“Wouldn’t that defeat the purpose,” my father replied. Another time, a man asked him the same question, and he was pointed toward the “religion and philosophy” section.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">What upsets him is the way people treat books. It bothers him when he sees the corners get turned when someone tries to shove a book back in its place on the shelf without looking. It hurts when people walk in and complain how small the bookstore is and then don’t look at his books. It annoys when people insist on heavy discounts for a $10 book, but wear shirts that would cost $50.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Delhi, he often says, is a city with more writers than readers. “Books are not written because the world needs to read another one,” he once told me a long time ago. “It’s because writers feel the world must read their books.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">We were somewhere in North Delhi at a used bookstore. I was sitting on a pile of books, sipping a cold drink, my hands caked in book dust, wondering how on earth my father had found this decrepit place and why people feel the need to write books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">There was a time when my father would skulk around the city, forever on the lookout for old and out-of-print books. He knew every nook and cranny of the city where he could find them and sometimes would take me along on these intrepid “treasure hunts”. My father would get a lot of leads from the pavement and second-hand booksellers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In turn, he would help them sift through their stash and lend a friendly ear to their troubles. He also had a knack of mending old books, ravished by termites and silver fish, by treating them with spirits, and selling them for a small price. Today, like independent bookstores, the pavement and second-hand booksellers are also finding it hard to keep books and survive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A chain bookstore the size of a food court that opened much later in the same marketplace openly declared that they will have him shut by the end of the year. They couldn’t.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the past few years, independent booksellers like Fact &amp; Fiction around the world are fighting to stay in business. The flurry of chains, online retail, and now e-readers and tablets are gradually edging the corner bookstore out. But the bigger dragon to slay is the skyrocketing rents of commercial spaces in recent times, spitting fire on the ground on which they stand. Had my brother and I been in school today, perhaps my father would not have been able to afford the fees.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Many claim there is little or no future for small corner bookstores. But it isn’t books that will suddenly cease to exist if the corner bookstore goes. The glut of shopping malls swelling on the Indian cityscape house outlets of a chain bookstore offering stationery, stuffed toys, DVDs, and books at a discount.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Online book retailing is no longer a mere threat. Earlier this month, Flipkart.com sold one million books in a single day. According to a Nielsen survey, it occupied an average 40 to 45 percent share of the book trade in 2013.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Vying for the same space is Amazon, which has just entered the Indian market.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A day will dawn when a section of readers might miss the experience of walking into a corner bookstore, recognizing a few faces, stumbling upon an unexpected book, long for the civility of a conversation outside a bookstore, crave for a bookseller whose approving smile on the purchase of a copy of Man Without Qualities could be the beginning of a beautiful literary friendship.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Few might remember the smell of a bookstore in the morning after the shutters are lifted. And, who would tell me the story a writer confessed about skipping lunch to save enough for a particular book he wanted from Fact &amp; Fiction?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A bookstore is a sea of stories. India needs to support its independent bookstores, perhaps now more than ever, for the same reason it seeks to preserve its architectural heritage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">I am often surprised how a tiny bookstore in a market dominated by a cinema, garish bars, and garment stores attracted and inspired a generation of writers and scholars.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A good bookstore, however, can’t survive on its lore.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">My father and others who run independent bookstores can no longer get access to the books they were once known for. Their shelves are going barren by the day as they are rejecting the mass-market pulp fiction and the lowbrow offerings the publishers are forcing their way.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">At a recent literature festival, a popular writer who has sold close to two million copies of a truly mediocre novel was introduced to a renowned novelist. “So, what do you like to read,” asked the renowned novelist. “Actually sir, I don’t like to read. I just like to tell stories,” he answered.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">For years, my father has been dealing with inept marketing people of publishing houses to keep his selection eclectic. Today they are the ones responsible for bringing books to India and are turning their backs on him. It’s sad because they are only concerned about ordering books in bulk to meet sales margins — Books that are tried-and-tested, formula-driven drivel, found on international bestseller lists. Books they can’t go wrong on excel sheets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Every day independent bookshops around the world are shutting down. Booksellers like my father are being swept out of the book trade. An evening is not far when books will close on corner bookstores like his and the blues he softly plays will forever stop.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jairaj Singh is the editor of Time Out, Delhi.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/indias-foodie-websites-bring-gourmet-treats-to-your-door/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/indias-foodie-websites-bring-gourmet-treats-to-your-door/" target="_blank">India’s Foodie Web Sites Bring Gourmet Treats to Delhi Doors</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/love-in-the-time-of-durjoy-datta/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/love-in-the-time-of-durjoy-datta/" target="_blank">Love in the Time of Durjoy Datta</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/did-chetan-bhagat-scrub-whitewash-the-godhra-riots-in-kai-po-che/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/did-chetan-bhagat-scrub-whitewash-the-godhra-riots-in-kai-po-che/" target="_blank">‘Kai Po Che’ and the Strange Case of the Vanishing Villain</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/five-questions-for-author-tahar-ben-jelloun/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/five-questions-for-author-tahar-ben-jelloun/" target="_blank">Five Questions for: Author Tahar Ben Jelloun</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/fest-delhi-gang-rape-dominated-conversations/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/fest-delhi-gang-rape-dominated-conversations/" target="_blank">At Jaipur Lit Fest, Delhi Gang Rape Dominated Conversations</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A customer at the Fact &amp; Fiction bookstore in New Delhi. | Courtesy of Jairaj Singh | Ajit Vikram Singh | Mansi Midha | The Fact &amp; Fiction bookstore in Vasant Vihar, New Delhi. | Courtesy of Jairaj Singh</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020130621e96l001p5</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_072.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark138">finance</a><a name="bookmark139">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Apple trial examines e-mail by Steve Jobs; Executive says message does not indicate firm colluded with</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">publishers</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By BRIAN X.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Just days after Apple introduced the iPad and opened an e-bookstore, the biggest player in the e-book market, Amazon.com, changed the way it sold digital titles. Steven P. Jobs shot off an e-mail to the Apple executive who had negotiated deals with the publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Wow, we have really lit the fuse on a powder keg,’’ Mr. Jobs, the late Apple chief executive officer, wrote in the e-mail, dated Jan. 30, 2010, to Eddy Cue, the company’s senior vice president of Internet software and services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The e-mail was brought up as evidence during the second half of Mr. Cue’s testimony in a New York courtroom on Monday, where much of the discussion focused on whether Apple had intended to help the publishers raise Amazon’s prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Cue testified Monday that Mr. Jobs’s e-mail had not been a memo congratulating him about how Apple’s entry into the e-book market affected Amazon, causing it to switch to a business model called agency pricing, in which the publishers, not the retailer, sets the price of the books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Cue said Mr. Jobs had been remarking on the company’s ability to ‘‘cause ripples’’ in the e-book industry, which was then largely dominated by Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">While Mr. Cue conceded that some e-book prices had gone up as a result of agency pricing, he noted that many titles might not have become available in any digital store at all if Apple had not introduced agency pricing to the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">He said he had learned from his meetings with publishers that they were unhappy with Amazon’s uniform $9.99 pricing for e-books and that they were planning to use a tactic known as windowing — delaying the release of an e-book until after the more expensive hardcover had been in stores for a while.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Cue testified that both he and Mr. Jobs believed that ‘‘withholding books is a disaster for any bookstore.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The U.S. Justice Department was not persuaded. Lawrence Buterman, a Justice Department lawyer, asked Mr. Cue whether he was aware that only 37 e-books had ever been windowed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">‘‘The number doesn’t matter,’’ Mr. Cue said. ‘‘What matters is which books. Thirty-seven could be a huge number if it’s the right books.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Both parties showed their evidence on a projector screen. Apple’s legal team used a MacBook to shuffle among evidence documents, stacking them side by side in split screens and zooming in on specific paragraphs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">In contrast, the Justice Department’s lawyers could show only one piece of evidence at a time. One video that Mr. Buterman played as evidence failed to produce the audio commentary needed to make his point.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In its antitrust case brought a year ago, the federal government is trying to cast Apple as the ringmaster that conspired with five big book publishers to raise e-book prices. The publishers have all settled their cases.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On Monday, the Justice Department’s lawyers homed in on a condition in Apple’s contracts with the publishers: the ‘‘most favored nation’’ clause, which required publishers to allow Apple to sell e-books at the same price as</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">the books would be sold in any other store. Apple has said that clause existed to guarantee that Apple customers got the lowest e-book prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But Mr. Buterman argued that it defeated Amazon’s ability to compete on price and that it had left Amazon with no choice but to switch to the agency model while allowing the publishers to raise prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Cue said he disagreed. He noted that Amazon had 90 percent of the e-book market before Apple entered the game.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Amazon could have negotiated a better deal,’’ he said. ‘‘They had a lot more power.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Lawyers for Apple and the government spent much of the hearing debating whether the e-mails exchanged between Apple executives and publishers illustrated Apple’s intent to help the publishers force Amazon’s hand. In one e-mail sent to Mr. Jobs, Mr. Cue was reviewing his meeting with the publishers, saying they were interested in solving the ‘‘Amazon issue.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Cue said he was referring to the publishers’ ability to price books above Amazon’s uniform price of $9.99 in the Apple iBookstore.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Apple had proposed price caps of $12.99 to $14.99 for new releases. But he said that did not refer to enabling the publishers to force Amazon to raise prices, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130618e96j0002x</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_073.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark140">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark141">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Apple and Netflix Dominate Online Video</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By BRIAN X.

By some measures, Apple is No. 1 in online video, but by others, Netflix is leading.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/06/19HBO-GO-WatchESPN-Come-to-Apple-TV.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Apple on Wednesday </a><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/06/19HBO-GO-WatchESPN-Come-to-Apple-TV.html" class="a" target="_blank">released new statistics</a> <span style=" color: #000;">on the videos it provides in the iTunes Store. The company said customers were downloading 800,000 television episodes and 350,000 movies a day.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/the-npd-group-apple-itunes-dominates-internet-video-market/" class="s1" target="_blank">In a recent study, the NPD Group, a research firm, said Apple was by and large </a><a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/the-npd-group-apple-itunes-dominates-internet-video-market/" class="a" target="_blank">the leader for home video</a><a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/the-npd-group-apple-itunes-dominates-internet-video-market/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/the-npd-group-apple-itunes-dominates-internet-video-market/" class="a" target="_blank">downloads</a>. For television shows, iTunes accounted for 67 percent of this market in 2012, and Microsoft’s Xbox video service was a distant second with 14 percent of the market, NPD said. For movies, iTunes had a 65 percent share of the market, with Amazon and Microsoft far behind at 10 percent each, it said.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/the-npd-group-as-tv-viewing-drives-subscription-video-on-demand-netflix-dominates-but-hulu-plus-and-amazon-gain/" class="s1" target="_blank">Another popular method for watching movies and TV online is paying a subscription and streaming as many as you want. In the subscriptions-based video streaming market, </a>Netflix is dominant, with a 90 percent share<span class="p">, and Hulu Plus and Amazon are still hardly relevant.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">To put things in perspective, subscription-based streaming is the most popular method for watching online video. For all the movies watched at home in the first quarter of 2013, 19 percent of consumers watched a movie using a subscription-based service like Netflix, and 5 percent downloaded a movie rental from an on-demand service like iTunes, according to Russ Crupnick, an NPD analyst who follows the online video industry. About 74 percent of consumers watched a movie on a DVD or Blu-ray disc they bought or rented, he said. (The numbers are not mutually exclusive; some people watch movies on Blu-ray, Netflix and iTunes.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Apple, to date, has not entered subscription-based video streaming. Instead, it has teamed up with companies that offer that service. The Netflix and Hulu Plus apps are available on the Apple TV.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Apple on Wednesday also announced new partnerships with Home Box Office and ESPN. Coming to the Apple TV are the HBO GO app, which allows HBO subscribers to stream the network’s programs, along with the WatchESPN app, which allows cable TV subscribers to stream some ESPN channels. Apple TV owners can get the apps by downloading a free software update.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/hbo-go-the-best-online-video-service-i-cannot-use/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/hbo-go-the-best-online-video-service-i-cannot-use/" target="_blank">HBO Go, the Best Online Video Service I Cannot Use</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/apple-hopes-to-re-enter-the-living-room/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/apple-hopes-to-re-enter-the-living-room/" target="_blank">Apple Hopes to Re-enter the Living Room</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/a-30-cable-and-an-ipad-on-a-television/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/a-30-cable-and-an-ipad-on-a-television/" target="_blank">A $30 Cable and an iPad on a Television</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/google-asks-secret-court-for-permission-to-publish-national-security-request-data/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/google-asks-secret-court-for-permission-to-publish-national-security-request-data/" target="_blank">Google Asks Secret Court for Permission to Publish National Security Request Data</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/daily-report-tech-companies-reveal-some-numbers-on-requests-for-customer-data/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/daily-report-tech-companies-reveal-some-numbers-on-requests-for-customer-data/" target="_blank">Daily Report: Tech Companies Reveal Some Numbers on Requests for Customer Data</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Steve Jobs discussing the Apple TV in 2010.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">If parents of preschoolers want to plop their children in front of the laptop or tablet to watch “Blue’s Clues” and “Dora the Explorer,” they may have to join Amazon’s subscription streaming service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On Tuesday, Viacom and Amazon announced an extensive, multiyear deal that includes granting Amazon exclusive rights to Nickelodeon’s preschool shows. The agreement, estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars, is Amazon’s biggest streaming deal yet and signals that the heated battle for online rights has increasingly moved to television’s youngest viewers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In April, Netflix said it would allow its deal with Viacom to expire. Then last month Netflix struck a deal with the Walt Disney Company to gain exclusive rights to stream Disney Jr. series like “Jake and the Never Land Pirates” and Disney XD’s “Tron: Uprising.” In 2011, Netflix introduced its “Just for Kids” menu with a selection of shows and movies aimed at children, or parents looking to entertain them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">That put pressure on Amazon to secure children’s programming for its Amazon Prime subscription service, which it hopes will compete with Netflix and Hulu in the streaming video market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon has a smaller streaming audience than Netflix, but for Viacom the arrangement presents the opportunity to have tie-ins with the consumer products that Amazon sells, like DVDs, “Dora” backpacks and “SpongeBob SquarePants” beach towels.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“They’re a very consumer driven company and they also connect our Nickelodeon content to products,” Philippe Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive, said in a telephone interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As part of the deal announced on Tuesday, Amazon also secured the rights to stream shows that are first broadcast on Viacom’s Comedy Central and MTV, including some episodes of “Jersey Shore” and “Teen Mom 2.” But the key to the agreement is making Amazon’s Prime Instant Video subscription service the exclusive outlet for pre-school-age children to watch old episodes of shows like “Dora the Explorer,” “Go, Diego, Go!” and “The Backyardigans.” Since children do not mind reruns as much as adults do, deals for these types of shows often cost less than series aimed at adults.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Bill Carr, Amazon’s vice president of digital video and music, said in a statement that children’s programming was “one of the most-watched TV genres on Prime Instant Video.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In a letter to customers, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, said the deal gave Prime Instant Video more than 250 TV seasons and more than 3,900 episodes from Nick Jr., Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. “We have increased by 55 percent the number of episodes available to top Prime shows for kids,” Mr. Bezos wrote.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The deal, he said, added “400 episodes of new shows like ‘Team Umizoomi,’ ‘Bubble Guppies,’ ‘Victorious,’ ‘Big Time Rush’ and ‘Drake &amp; Josh.’ ”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon Prime members pay $79 a year for two-day free shipping, monthly Kindle e-book rentals and video streaming. The company has said it has millions of Prime subscribers but has declined to give an exact figure. Netflix has 27 million streaming subscribers in the United States. Hulu’s subscription service, Hulu Plus, has about four million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the past, Viacom has had a complicated relationship with subscription video on-demand services like Netflix. After an unexpected ratings drop at its Nickelodeon channel last year, analysts partly blamed a glut of old episodes available to Netflix for cannibalizing the cable channel’s ratings. Children increasingly watch shows via</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">streaming, but revenue from digital syndication deals still does not come close to that provided by advertisers who pay to reach viewers the old-fashioned way.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the quarter that ended March 31, advertising revenue at Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. rose 2 percent as the network rebounded with preschool audiences. Mr. Dauman said a fresh pipeline of shows had improved Nickelodeon’s ratings. As advertising revenue grows on the cable channel, Mr. Dauman has defended deals with digital subscription streaming services as good for both parties.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“Our job is to grow the pie,” Mr. Dauman said. “And having all these different revenue streams grows the overall pie.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Viacom will need to make an additional $125 million to $150 million in streaming deals in fiscal year 2013 to meet its goal of 10 percent affiliate growth, according to Bernstein Research.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Amazon has rapidly built its streaming service to compete with more established services, namely Netflix and Hulu. The Viacom deal is the latest example of the online retailing giant’s swooping in to gain streaming rights after deals with Netflix expire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">After Netflix declined to renew its rights to popular cable series like “Pawn Stars,” Amazon jumped in. In December, Amazon struck a deal with Time Warner to gain the exclusive streaming rights to TNT’s “The Closer” and “Falling Skies.” Netflix got exclusive rights to TNT’s “Dallas.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Amazon and CBS have a deal that will let Prime subscribers watch “Under the Dome,” a new science fiction series based on the Stephen King novel, four days after episodes are broadcast on CBS beginning June 24.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document NYTFEED020130604e9650038r</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_077.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark148">June 4, 2013, Tuesday Business Day; Dealbook</a><a name="bookmark149">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">I.B.M.

Since 2007, the company has spent $4.5 billion on more than a dozen acquisitions to build up its cloud software and services offerings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“We’re focusing on business services that leverage the cloud model,” said Ric Telford, vice president for I.B.M. cloud services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">I.B.M.’s first moves in the cloud market date to 2007. But its early emphasis, analysts say, had mainly been on so-called private clouds, in which the computing is delivered to users as service over the Internet, but from data centers owned by I.B.M.’s corporate customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But the SoftLayer acquisition will sharply expand I.B.M.’s capability to deliver computing services remotely to customers from I.B.M. data centers — the so-called public cloud model.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/category/main-topics/private-equity/?inline=nyt-classifier" class="s1" target="_blank">SoftLayer, a private company based in Dallas, has a network of 13 data centers in the United States, Singapore and Amsterdam, and revenue of about $400 million a year. GI Partners, a </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/category/main-topics/private-equity/?inline=nyt-classifier" class="a" target="_blank">private equity</a> <span style=" color: #000;">fund based in Menlo Park, Calif., is the majority owner of SoftLayer.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The SoftLayer data centers will be added to the 10 cloud services data centers I.B.M. now has worldwide. Erich Clementi, a senior vice president for I.B.M.’s technology services unit, said SoftLayer “completes our portfolio.” It</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">expands I.B.M.’s public cloud operations, he said, while adding expertise and technology for private clouds and hybrid services, which blend the public and private models.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Lance Crosby, chief executive of SoftLayer, said his company’s long-term goal had been to become “the de facto and most flexible platform for Internet cloud computing. And we couldn’t get there on our own.” I.B.M., he said, has the financial resources and relationships with corporate customers to accelerate the adoption of its cloud technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Beyond the acquisitions, I.B.M. hopes to offer the company’s homegrown technology as cloud services, like its Watson artificial intelligence software, which I.B.M. announced last month was being tailored as a smart customer service assistant.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Watson has a lot more potential because of the cloud delivery model,” Mr. Telford said.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Dannon<span class="p">, the yogurt maker, is a cloud services customer that reflects the I.B.M. strategy. It uses I.B.M. public cloud software for optimizing its pricing, promotions and product planning. The cloud software has helped Dannon’s sales planning teams improve the percentage of products sold to consumers to 98 percent from 75 percent — crucial for a food stuff with a limited shelf life. The software was developed by DemandTec, which</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">I.B.M. acquired last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In new projects, Dannon, owned by the French company Danone, is now pursuing a “cloud-first strategy,” said Timothy Weaver, the chief information officer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">I.B.M. has earmarked its cloud business as an area for investment and growth.

It has evolved into something equally old-fashioned: a huge gathering for the book industry to talk up titles, showcase high-profile authors and try to build elusive buzz for promising books.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/f/helen_fielding/index.html" class="s1" target="_blank">This year, the lineup of celebrity authors included Chelsea Handler, there to promote “Uganda Be Kidding Me,” a travelogue; </a>Helen Fielding<a href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/the-signature-of-all-things/" class="s1" target="_blank">, whose third Bridget Jones novel, “Mad About the Boy,” is scheduled for release in the fall; and Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of “Eat, Pray, Love,” who has written a new novel, </a><a href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/the-signature-of-all-things/" class="a" target="_blank">“The Signature of All</a><a href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/the-signature-of-all-things/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/the-signature-of-all-things/" class="a" target="_blank">Things,”</a><a href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/the-signature-of-all-things/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/the-signature-of-all-things/" class="s1" target="_blank">her first in 13 years.</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://omnificpublishing.com/index.php?main_page=index" class="s1" target="_blank">On the sprawling exhibit floor, publishers big and small rubbed elbows.

E-book sales, while still growing rapidly in the industry as a whole, have plateaued for some publishers. This provides more stability than the run-amok sales of previous years and gives publishers more clarity about consumers’ book-buying habits.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.bookstats.org/pdf/BookStats-Press-Release-2013-highlights.pdf" class="s1" target="_blank">BookStats, a </a><a href="http://www.bookstats.org/pdf/BookStats-Press-Release-2013-highlights.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">survey of the industry</a> <span style=" color: #000;">released last month, revealed that e-books now account for 20 percent of publishers’ revenues, up from 15 percent in 2011. “It seems like the growth rate of e-books has slowed,” said Carolyn Reidy, the chief executive of Simon &amp; Schuster.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">While there was the usual tut-tutting about Amazon — Becky Anderson, a co-owner of Anderson’s Bookshops, outside Chicago, referred to it as “the company that shall not be named” — there was also no booth on the exhibit floor from the New York-based unit of Amazon Publishing, which caused much fear and consternation in the industry when it was founded two years ago.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/technology/us-now-paints-apple-as-ringmaster-in-its-lawsuit-on-e-book-price-fixing.html" class="s1" target="_blank">In a panel titled “Publishing, Bookselling and the Whole Damn Thing,” John Sargent, the chief executive of Macmillan, called Attorney General Eric Holder “incompetent,” a comment on the Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Apple and five publishing companies filed last year.

It was created by Garry Trudeau of “Doonesbury,” and the pilot features a host of cameos from people like Bill Murray and Jon Stewart. It was a prohibitive favorite to win a series order from the moment Amazon started making the pilots available.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Price noted that “there had been inclinations” as long as 10 days ago that “Alpha House” had been selected, along with another of the live-action comedy pilots, “Betas.” That one seems especially geared for the audience that might be most attracted to use Amazon Prime: It’s about four friends looking for a big Internet payday by inventing a new social networking app.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The other three shows that won the audience feedback derby on Amazon are all shows for children. That means Amazon passed on such ideas as the “Onion News Empire,” a satire of a news network that starred Jeffrey Tambor; “Browsers,” another Web-based idea about a Huffington Post knockoff, which was a full-on musical created by David Javerbaum (formerly of “The Daily Show”) and starred Bebe Neuwirth (“Cheers”); and “Zombieland,” an adaptation of the 2009 movie. In that case, the show’s creator, Rhett Reese, tweeted a message saying the hostile reaction from the movie’s “die-hard” fans “hated the show out of existence.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Still, Mr. Price was buoyant about how important viewer reaction was to the whole process. “It was very helpful and we hope to do it again,” he said in a telephone interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Price said the live-action comedies would have “very similar budgets” to comedies on television networks. “If you look at the budget of premium cable half-hour shows, these would be right on that mix,” he said. The comedies will produce somewhat fewer episodes, however — 10 more this season for each of “Alpha House” and “Betas.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As for the scheduling, Mr. Price said that was flexible for the moment, with the comedies likely to be available to subscribers starting in “late fall or early 2014.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But Amazon is not committed — at least not yet — to the Netflix model of making all the episodes available at the same time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“Releasing them all at once means you are withholding them” as they are made, Mr. Price said, adding that Amazon is seeking to maximize viewer choice. That may mean “some kind of hybrid,” he said, adding, “We could start with a few and then roll out the others.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The children’s shows are important, Mr. Price said, because children’s entertainment has been well supported on Amazon Prime and its Kindle service.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Driving new subscribers to Amazon Prime is a chief motivator for the company’s expansion in entertainment (Amazon also has 24 movies on its development roster that it intends to test with audiences.) The company charges $79 for an annual subscription that offers streaming of movies and TV shows, access to books and free shipping on eligible items bought on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020130529e95u0043h</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_080.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark154">C</a><a name="bookmark155">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">AMAZON OFFERS PLATFORM, AND MONEY, FOR FAN FICTION</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">43 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">28 May 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

The involvement of Warner Brothers, which owns DC Entertainment, has already created hopeful speculation among comic book fans that they will one day be paid for writing new adventures for DC&#39;s superhero characters like Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">According to its news release, Amazon Publishing will pay royalties to both the rights holder of the original work and the authors of the new works. The standard royalty rate for authors will be 35 percent of the net revenue for works of at least 10,000 words, and 20 percent for short stories of 5,000 to 10,000 words.

In effect, Google said it was a way for everyone to build really big businesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The plan seems to be similar to the way Google got big in search, maps and many other services: make the smallest developers worldwide into allies, and the competition won&#39;t even see you coming.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The power comes from thousands and millions of developers that we don&#39;t see,&#39;&#39; said Greg DeMichillie, the product manager for the Google Cloud Platform, which includes GCE, storage and Google App Engine.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The strategy has roots in the experience that Eric Schmidt, Google&#39;s executive chairman, had from competing with Microsoft. At both Sun Microsystems, where he was chief technology officer, and Novell, where he was chief executive, Mr. Schmidt lost to Microsoft&#39;s ability to create a network of software developers who wrote applications for the Windows operating system. When he got to Google, Mr. Schmidt outmaneuvered Microsoft by using the Web the way Microsoft used Windows.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Even though Google is now a massive company, it still tries to enlist developers the same way. Google announced last week that App Engine would start to allow development in the PHP scripting language, a software language aimed at writing for broad distribution on the Web.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Embracing PHP is a great way to lower the barriers to entry&#39;&#39; for developers, said Mr. DeMichillie, a veteran of both Amazon Web Services and Adobe. Thanks to the connection to G.C.E., he said, &#39;&#39;it&#39;s on Google App Engine, but it is ultimately scalable.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Compute Engine and App Engine &#39;&#39;will work together by applications that will become computationally intensive, or require a different function&#39;&#39; that G.C.E. can provide, he said. &#39;&#39;Then it will hand data to App Engine to work with.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s intriguing to think of individual developers using Google&#39;s systems to reach billions of people, or the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">number-crunching of supercomputers lashed together from Google&#39;s cloud. But competitors are wise to Google&#39;s &#39;&#39;up from nowhere&#39;&#39; strategy by now, however. Amazon also made its cloud business as a place where start-ups could buy cheap computing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Microsoft, for its part, is combining its still-popular applications with Azure&#39;s capabilities in both computing and machine learning in the hope of bringing powerful new life to its installed base of customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">At first, Amazon&#39;s technical resources were hard to use, but the service has become increasingly more accessible, much the way Google adopted PHP. Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S., still has more features than the Google offering.

A trial is scheduled to begin June 3 in Federal District Court in New York.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Among other defenses, Apple says that both Amazon and the publishing companies were already contemplating a move to a different pricing model in 2009, before Apple entered the e-book business. Apple cites one Amazon executive who referred in an e-mail to the idea that Amazon got publishers to accept what it wanted all along as “Jedi mind tricks.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Apple, whose 2010 introduction of the iPad corresponded with its opening of a digital bookstore, denies that it tried to convince publishers to enforce a regime that would allow them to set their own retail prices for books, above the $9.99 price that Amazon was then charging.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In addition, Apple says that the Justice Department has selectively edited and distorted e-mails between executives of Apple and the publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“Apple injected much-needed competition and innovation into the e-book business,” said Orin Snyder, a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher who represents Apple. “The DOJ’s case is based on fictions and incomplete quotations. The actual evidence proves that Apple did not conspire to fix prices in the e-book business. We look forward to trial.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Justice Department accuses Apple of its own selective quotation. And, it said, the evidence shows that the publishing companies threatened to withhold books unless Amazon allowed them to set higher prices and that Apple “encouraged them to do so.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Apple seems particularly peeved about the government invoking e-mails of its former chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, to assert its case, saying the government’s selective editing of those e-mails deliberately distorts Mr. Jobs’s intentions.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/apple-case-e-mail.pdf" class="s1" target="_blank">The government’s court papers quote </a><a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/apple-case-e-mail.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">from an e-mail</a> <span style=" color: #000;">that Mr. Jobs sent on Jan. 24, 2010, to James Murdoch, who as head of News Corporation oversaw its publishing company, HarperCollins. That was three days before the introduction of the iPad, as Apple was furiously negotiating deals with publishers that would allow it to introduce its bookstore on the same day.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Apple says the government left out of its papers the fact that Mr. Jobs said Amazon might have the right price for e-books already, at $9.99. “Maybe they are right and we will fail,” Mr. Jobs wrote.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Taken in total, Apple said, the e-mail “shows a new entrant with no market power proposing an alternative business model to HarperCollins, and candidly recognizing that Apple has no power to predict or influence other retailers,” Apple said in pretrial papers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester who follows the publishing industry, said Apple still has a relatively small share of the e-book market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“Even though they have a big brand, their actions have had relatively little impact on the overall industry,” Ms. Rotman Epps said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Since Apple’s entry, e-book prices have gone down, the company said, with the average retail price of an electronic book falling 63 cents since April 2010, from $7.97 to $7.34.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Michael Cader, the creator of Publishers Lunch, an industry publication, said there were multiple ways of interpreting what had happened to e-book prices since the start of Apple’s iBookstore. He said at least part of the decline might reflect the exponential growth in older books, self-published books and books from an array of small and digital-only publishers, many of which are often sold for as little as 99 cents to $3.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">Edward Wyatt reported from Washington, and Brian X.

Correction: May 18, 2013, Saturday</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about Apple’s battle with the Justice Department over charges of price-fixing on e-books characterized incorrectly a comment by Michael Cader, of the industry publication Publishers Lunch, on the decline in e-book prices. He speculated that the growth in older books, self-published books and books from small and digital publishers might account for part of the decline; he did not state that as a fact.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020130517e95h000bc</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_085.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark164">finance</a><a name="bookmark165">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">E-book conspiracy suit depicts Apple as leader; Firm was ‘ringmaster’ in effort to increase prices, U.S.</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">officials say</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By EDWARD WYATT and NICK WINGFIELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">886 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">16 May 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">International Herald Tribune INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">13</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The e-mail, from Steven P. Jobs of Apple to James Murdoch of News Corp., reads as if one old sport were trying to cajole another into joining a caper: ‘‘Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream e-books market at $12.99 and $14.99.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">According to the U.S. Justice Department, that e-mail is part of the evidence that Apple was the ‘‘ringmaster’’ in a price-fixing conspiracy in the market for e-books, a more direct leadership role than originally portrayed in the department’s April 2012 antitrust lawsuit against Apple and five publishing companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In its suit, the government said that Apple and the publishers conspired to fix e-book prices as part of a scheme to force Amazon to raise its e-book price from a uniform $9.99 to the higher level noted by Mr. Jobs in the e-mail, which publishers wanted. That, the department said, resulted in higher prices to consumers and ill-gotten profits for Apple and its partners.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The e-mail was released Tuesday as part of the government’s filing before the trial in the case, set to begin June 3 in New York.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Two days after Mr. Jobs’s e-mail to Mr. Murdoch, HarperCollins, the publishing company owned by News Corp., signed an agreement with Apple to require all sellers of electronic books to adopt the new pricing model, the government said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Apple is the only defendant left in the lawsuit after five publishing companies — Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon &amp; Schuster — agreed last year and earlier this year to settle the charges.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tom Neumayr, a spokesman for Apple, said the company had not conspired to fix prices on e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘We helped transform the e-book market with the introduction of the iBookstore in 2010, bringing consumers an expanded selection of e-books and delivering innovative new features,’’ Mr. Neumayr said. ‘‘The market has been thriving and innovating since Apple’s entry, and we look forward to going to trial to defend ourselves and move forward.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Justice Department’s latest filings in the case also paint a picture of an Apple willing to use its power in mobile apps to strong-arm reluctant partners. That is especially evident in the accusations the department makes about Apple’s dealings with Random House, the last major publisher to resist striking an e-books deal with Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In July 2010, Mr. Jobs, Apple’s former chief executive, told the chief executive of Random House, Markus Dohle, that the publisher would suffer a loss of support from Apple if it held out much longer, according to an account of the conversation provided by Mr. Dohle in the filing. Two months later, Apple threatened to block an e-book application by Random House from appearing in Apple’s App Store because it had not agreed to a deal with Apple, the filing said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">After Random House finally agreed to a contract on Jan. 18, 2011, Eddy Cue, the Apple executive in charge of its e-books deals, sent an e-mail to Mr. Jobs attributing the publisher’s capitulation, in part, to ‘‘the fact that I prevented an app from Random House from going live in the app store,’’ the filing reads.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The newly released documents also quote David Shanks, chief executive of Penguin, as saying that Apple was the ‘‘facilitator and go-between’’ for the publishing companies in arranging the agreement.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">And the documents quote Mr. Dohle as saying that an Apple executive had counseled him that the publishing company could threaten to withhold e-books from Amazon to force Amazon to accept the higher prices. Random House was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The price-fixing suit charges that Apple advised publishers to move from a wholesale pricing model, which let retailers charge what they wanted, to a system that allowed publishers to set their own e-book prices, a model known as agency pricing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The publishers said Amazon was pricing e-books below their actual cost, putting financial pressure on the publishers that they said would drive them out of business. The dispute underscored the extent to which competition from digital retailers like Amazon was transforming the traditional book industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Three of the publishers, HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster and Hachette, settled with the government immediately. Penguin, Macmillan and Apple originally decided to fight the charges. But in December, to clear the way for its merger with Random House, Penguin settled, followed by Macmillan in February.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The settlements call for the publishers to lift restrictions imposed on discounting and other promotions by e-book retailers. The companies are also prohibited from entering into new agreements with similar restrictions until December 2014.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The publishers must also notify the government in advance about any e-book ventures they plan with each other, and they are prohibited for five years from agreeing to any kind of so-called most-favored-nation clause with any retailer, which establishes that no other retailer is allowed to sell e-books for a lower price.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130515e95g000en</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_086.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark166">Gadgetwise</a><a name="bookmark167">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Technology; Personal Tech</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Kobo’s New E-Reader Is Sharp, but Maybe Not Sharp Enough</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By ROY FURCHGOTT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">408 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">15 May 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.kobo.com/koboaurahd" class="s1" target="_blank">Kobo has produced what it said was the highest-resolution e-ink reader, the </a>Aura HD<span class="p">, which means it should have the best-looking screen, right?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">This is why you can’t buy devices based on specifications. In a side-by-side comparison, I still preferred the screen of the lower-resolution Amazon Kindle Paperwhite.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Not that Kobo isn’t superior in many ways. For one, it allows for more customization. If you go into the menu for fonts, there is an advanced option that lets you adjust the darkness of the type, type size and sharpness of the type. It also offers a sizable selection of 24 fonts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It also has a 1 GHz processor (faster than the Paperwhite), so you shouldn’t get hung up flipping pages. It comes with 4 GB of built-in memory (that’s double the Paperwhite). An additional 32 GB can be added with a Micro SD Card.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Like the Paperwhite, the Aura’s adjustable back lighting makes it excellent for bedtime reading. It claims a battery life of up to two months.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But to me it has two significant disadvantages.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One is the shopping experience. I find it easier to shop on Amazon, which tends to bring in more mainstream authors and applicable titles in my searches than the Kobo store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The other disadvantage is the look of its plain text. Even though the Paperwhite has lower resolution, for me, it’s the easier screen to read. That’s because the background color of the screen, whether using the back light or not, is a lighter color than that of the Aura. It makes the type appear clearer for me.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Aura might be better for publications like magazines that have detailed drawings or photos. But if you want to use a reader for magazines, which are often filled with stunning photography, wouldn’t you prefer a color tablet?</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.kobo.com/kobo-aurahd.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Finally, there is the cost. The </a>Kobo Aura is $170<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GEKXUO/ref%3Dfs_cl" class="s1" target="_blank">. The most similar Paperwhite model, which like the Aura is Wi-Fi only, is </a>$140<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/qa-controlling-access-to-a-kindle-fire-hd/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/qa-controlling-access-to-a-kindle-fire-hd/" target="_blank">Q&amp;A: Controlling Access to a Kindle Fire HD</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/qa-reformatting-a-kindle-fire/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/qa-reformatting-a-kindle-fire/" target="_blank">Q&amp;A: Reformatting a Kindle Fire</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/qa-reading-google-books-on-an-iphone/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/qa-reading-google-books-on-an-iphone/" target="_blank">Q&amp;A: Reading Google Books on an iPhone</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/qa-resetting-a-kindles-automatic-bookmark/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/qa-resetting-a-kindles-automatic-bookmark/" target="_blank">Q&amp;A: Resetting a Kindle’s Automatic Bookmark</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/qa-borrowing-e-books-from-the-library/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><span class="s3">Q&amp;A: Borrowing E-Books from the Library</span> Document NYTB000020130515e95f000p2</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_087.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark168">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark169">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Daily Report: Prosecutors Say Apple Had Greater Role in Fixing E-Book Prices</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">307 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">15 May 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">During the dot-com boom, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, the venture capital investment firm, all but minted money, making prescient early investments in Netscape Communications, Amazon.com and Google and delivering astonishing returns to investors. Along the way, it became a symbol of Silicon Valley.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But the firm has hit a rough patch over the last decade, frustrated by unsuccessful forays into clean technology and by a catch-up effort to take later-stage stakes in social media companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Kleiner has held a series of status-report meetings with its outside investors this year, acknowledging that recent fund performance ‘‘wasn’t great,’’ one attendee said. ‘‘They really believed green tech was going to be the next big technology wave,’’ that investor added.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Kleiner has also cut some management fees and reorganized its investment approach, eliminating three ‘‘silos’’ that separated teams making investments in clean technology, health care and technology. The firm has added more investing partners with digital expertise, like the former Twitterexecutive Mike Abbott, after it missed the early window on hot media start-ups like Facebook and Twitter and jumped in later at higher valuations.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A spokeswoman for Kleiner, which manages $7 billion, said the firm’s partners had declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The latest setback is the fading fortunes of Fisker Automotive, a green-car start-up backed by Kleiner that has laid off much of its work force and hired bankruptcy advisers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">At a hearing last month, Republican members of a House of Representatives oversight committee asked witnesses from Fisker and the U.S. Energy Department whether Democratic political contributions and influence from Kleiner partners, led by John Doerr, an adviser to President Barack Obama, had helped Fisker gain $192 million in government green-energy loans.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">While the questions were clearly partisan, the spotlight on Kleiner added a new level of public criticism to a reputational injury that has been building for several years, denting Kleiner’s status as one of the top technology venture capital firms.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Some experts predict that Fisker could become one of the biggest venture-capital losses ever. Fisker has raised</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">$1.1 billion in venture financing, the most for any clean-technology start-up, compared with $848 million for Solyndra, the solar-panel maker that filed for bankruptcy in 2011, according to the Cleantech Group, which tracks such investments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Kleiner investors say that three venture funds the firm raised in 1994, 1996 and 1999 — which contained Juniper Networks, Amazon and Google — delivered staggering returns. The 1994 fund delivered 32 times the investors’ money, the 1996 fund 17 times, and the 1999 fund, 6 times. But since then, they note, funds raised in 2000 and 2004 have been unprofitable. A $1 billion fund raised in 2008 devoted to clean technology was also showing losses, one investor said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘They had stellar returns for years, but their reputation has been tarnished by performance of late,’’ said Nancy Lambert, a former private banker at Citigroup who is now an independent adviser to wealthy families and foundations. ‘‘It doesn’t seem like investors are turning away; they’re just more cautious.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Kleiner’s investors have included top universities like Harvard and Yale, the philanthropic Ford Foundation and certain venture capital funds-of-funds.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The firm’s reputation was also dented last year when a junior partner, Ellen Pao, filed a sex discrimination lawsuit. She contended that the firm had improperly retaliated against her after she complained about being pressured into a sexual relationship by a colleague, resulting in lower compensation and poor performance reviews.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Kleiner has denied all the claims and said that it had chosen not to promote Ms. Pao based on valid ‘‘performance concerns.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The shift in Kleiner’s fortunes is emblematic of the venture capital business as a whole, where the titanic returns from the late-1990s dot-com bubble have ebbed, and investor dollars flowing into new funds have slowed as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘The days of huge returns in venture are long gone,’’ said Scott Ryles, a longtime Silicon Valley banker who has led two Kleiner-backed companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Venture funds returned 35.7 percent annually in the decade ending in 2000, but they lost 1.9 percent annually in the decade ending in 2010, according to data compiled by Cambridge Associates for the National Venture Capital Association.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As a result, annual commitments to venture funds have fallen from $56.1 billion in the four years ending in 2001, to $17.3 billion in the four years ending in 2012, according to Thomson Reuters data compiled by the association.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Founded in 1972, Kleiner scored big early returns on Tandem Computers, a maker of processors used by banks and brokerage firms, and Genentech, a biotechnology start-up whose initial public offering electrified the stock market in 1980. The firm cashed in on a spate of hot Internet offerings, led by Netscape and Amazon, during the dot-com bubble.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">About five years after the bubble burst, clean technology became Kleiner’s marquee strategy. Kleiner hired Al Gore, the former vice president, soon after his 2006 film about global warming, ‘‘An Inconvenient Truth,’’ won two Oscars.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Doerr, a member of Mr. Obama’s economic recovery advisory board, has advocated for government policies and subsidies favoring clean-technology innovation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">‘‘Going green is bigger than the Internet,’’ Mr. Doerr said in 2007. ‘‘It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Kleiner has invested in 88 clean-technology companies since 1999, more than any other venture firm, according to Cleantech Group. Those companies include the personal-transport device maker Segway, the fuel-cell developer Bloom Energy and the utility smart-grid provider Silver Spring Networks, which went public in March.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In funds raised in 2006, 2008 and 2010, green technology was one of three main strategies, under the aegis of the general partners Ray Lane and Bill Joy — who have since both become partners emeritus. While still committed to clean technology, Kleiner has played down the sector and sought to make less expensive investments within it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Some of the clean technology bets, like Mascoma, a specialized ethanol start-up, and Sundrop Fuels, a developer of biogasoline — gasoline produced from biological products like algae — require plants that cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Pavel Molchanov, a biofuels analyst at the advisory firm Raymond James. In March, Mascoma withdrew plans for a stock offering first filed in September 2011, citing market conditions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The green-technology portfolio has had its share of flops. Think Global, a Norwegian electric-car company, failed in 2011. Kleiner’s investment in MiaSolé, a solar-panel producer, was wiped out when the company was sold to a Chinese clean-energy company at the end of last year. Plans have stalled for V-Vehicle, a plastic-car company later renamed Next Autoworks, which also had backing from Google Ventures and T. Boone Pickens.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Because Kleiner did not invest in earlier clean-technology blowups like Solyndra and Range Fuels, which also received government loans, Fisker presents a new level of public criticism. At the House hearing April 24, Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, asked Fisker’s founder and former executive chairman, Henrik Fisker, about Kleiner’s ability to help obtain government loans.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Kleiner Perkins has helped raise ‘‘over $2 million in political contributions in the 2008 election cycle, most of which went to Democrats including President Obama,’’ Mr. Jordan said. He asked if that, or Mr. Doerr’s role as an Obama adviser, had helped Fisker ‘‘to get a loan, get taxpayer money from the Department of Energy?’’</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Fisker denied ‘‘any undue political favors or anything like that.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He noted that it was Mr. Lane, not Mr. Doerr, who had served as Kleiner’s representative on the Fisker board.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As it focused on green technology, Kleiner lost ground to some rivals like Accel Partners and Greylock Partners, which made early investments in Facebook, which Kleiner missed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The firm seemed to address the issue in late 2010 by hiring Mary Meeker, the former Morgan Stanley Internet analyst known as the Queen of the Net during the bubble.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ms. Meeker has led a $1 billion digital growth fund started in 2011 that has made about 25 later-stage bets including several hot social media start-ups, putting Kleiner in that game, but at higher valuations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">While a bet on Facebook is up slightly, its shares of the game developer Zynga are down sharply. Kleiner’s biggest current holding, in Twitter, is valued at more than double Kleiner’s cost, and the fund is up so far over all, a person briefed on the fund said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Some of Kleiner’s later clean-technology investments have a more digital focus, like Nest Labs, which makes smart thermostats; OPower, which offers energy-efficiency strategies for utility customers; and Clean Power Finance, which finances solar-power installations.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But one of its largest investments, at more than $100 million, is Fisker.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In mid-April, the Energy Department seized $21 million from a Fisker reserve account about 10 days before a scheduled loan repayment. Fisker is seeking new funds. But with its car production stalled since mid-2012, any outcome is likely to shred the value of Kleiner’s stake.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130508e9590003e</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_090.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark174">B</a><a name="bookmark175">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">AMAZON&#39;S BOOM IN THE CLOUD</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By QUENTIN HARDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">39 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">6 May 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">6</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

In addition to picking up customers, it generates other businesses that require their own care and feeding. And some of those businesses can illustrate how much more business is out there.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">On Tuesday, Amazon Web Services is having a meeting for developers and customers in San Francisco. It is the fourth of 12 such meetings Amazon is holding worldwide; the first was in New York on April 18 and the last will be in São Paulo, Brazil, on July 30. In between, Amazon will be in Delhi and Berlin, among other cities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">These gatherings will include lots of cheerleading and information from Amazon Web Services directed toward prospective customers and will also have meetings for companies that work closely with Web services on things like databases, security, and application development. About 650 companies are partners with Amazon Web Services, and there are another 723 consulting partners that attract customers looking to tie the unit into their business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Amazon Web Services is growing fast. It has over 1,600 job openings on its Web site and accounted for the vast majority of the $798 million in &#39;&#39;other&#39;&#39; revenue Amazon reported in the quarter that ended March 31. Still, it wants those other companies to be really active on its behalf so it can remain the leader in so-called &#39;&#39;public clouds,&#39;&#39; or cloud computing services for rent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">A look at one of the partners, Eucalyptus Systems, illustrates the kind of scale the Amazon service operates on. Eucalyptus provides cloud software that is used primarily for testing big Amazon service projects. That is, even before some companies go on Amazon Web Services, they build mini-Web services clouds.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One customer of Eucalyptus, AppDynamics, tests new software for Netflix, the largest customer of the Amazon service. &#39;&#39;Even before their software is on A.W.S., we are categorizing and analyzing over a billion transactions,&#39;&#39; said Thomas Morse, director of information technology and operations at App Dynamics. &#39;&#39;Netflix inflicts a unique kind of pain on a system, with tens of thousands of computing nodes supporting millions of actions a minute.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Eucalyptus, which began life as an open-source project for people to build their own clouds, moved into supporting Amazon Web Services once Amazon captured such a large share of the market. &#39;&#39;They&#39;ve got hundreds of thousands of customers now,&#39;&#39; said Marten Mickos, chief executive of Eucalyptus. Because almost all of these customers are companies, he said, &#39;&#39;it is used by millions of people. It gives them meaning for a number of years.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Last week the data storage giant EMC and its affiliate VMware, which are worried about the Amazon service, announced creation of Pivotal, a company that includes its own Amazon-type cloud. This summer, Google is likely to announce an expansion of its own Amazon Web Services-type unit, called Google Compute Engine.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Both Pivotal and Google are working hard on partner networks of their own. Elsewhere, a wealth of consortia with the word &#39;&#39;open&#39;&#39; in their names are looking for their own openings. Many of these companies are heavily backed by older incumbent companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Mickos, who sold MySQL, a relational database management system, to Sun Microsystems for $1 billion in 2008, sees the completion as a three-way competition. &#39;&#39;There are the old guys, like IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Intel</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">and Cisco, who are trying to get into new stuff,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;There are the server virtualization companies, like VMware and Citrix, who say the cloud is just more virtualization of your existing equipment. Then there are the pure plays, like A.W.S. and Google.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">On Monday, Eucalyptus introduced a new version of its product that allows customers to test even bigger projects before they move to the Amazon service. In the future, Mr. Mickos said, the company would look to make its product compatible with Google&#39;s service as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It is the most interesting strategic thing we can do,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Amazon is the standard now, Google will compete. There is an old world that won&#39;t cross over.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">An Amazon Web Services data center that serves the eastern United States.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">BERLIN -- Amazon, the world&#39;s biggest online retailer, said Thursday that it planned to hire 70 software developers at a new cloud-computing center in Germany as it tried to consolidate its position in the growing field.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Werner Vogels, the chief technology officer at Amazon, said the company chose Germany because it was the largest market in Europe and because Berlin was a good source of qualified software engineers and application developers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Vogels said Amazon&#39;s sales of cloud-computing were accelerating in Europe, as technology managers sought to cut costs and were increasingly reassured that sensitive corporate data could stay secure in remote data centers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;All I can say is we are very happy with the development of cloud-computing sales in Europe,&#39;&#39; Mr. Vogels said during an interview at the cloud-computing conference in Berlin, which was attended by 935 software developers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The engineers would work with a team at Amazon&#39;s European headquarters in Dublin but be based in Berlin and Dresden.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">At the same time, the U.S. tech giant is girding for possible strikes by workers at two of its largest distribution centers in Europe.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon employees in Bad Hersfeld who belong to ver.di, a German trade union, voted Monday to authorize a strike. Mechthild Middeke, a ver.di spokeswoman organizing workers at the Bad Hersfeld plant, said 97.6 percent of ver.di workers at the facility had voted to strike.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The employees want Amazon to sign a collective bargaining agreement used by some local employers, which ver.di says could increase the annual pay and benefits of Amazon workers as much as a third. Amazon has refused to sign the agreement, arguing that the U.S. company pays workers at levels comparable to other local online retailers, Ms. Middeke said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ver.di wants Amazon to pay the roughly 9,000 workers at its eight logistics centers in the country as &#39;&#39;retailing&#39;&#39; workers under German law, which would qualify them for the higher pay. Amazon says the workers are &#39;&#39;logistics&#39;&#39; employees, who on average earn €9.30, or $12.10, an hour in their first year of service and more than €10 an hour thereafter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We will do everything possible should there be strikes to make sure that our customers in Germany are served,&#39;&#39; said Christine Höger, a spokeswoman for Amazon Germany in Munich. Ms. Höger said that Amazon paid its logistics employees more than comparable German businesses pay for logistics workers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ver.di members at Amazon&#39;s distribution center in Leipzig voted last month to strike. Dates for the strikes have not been set, Ms. Middeke, the union representative, said. She declined to say if her union represented a majority of workers at either Amazon facility.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;A work stoppage will take place in the near future,&#39;&#39; Ms. Middeke said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ms. Höger said Amazon had attempted to reach agreement with ver.di representatives, but had made little progress.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We had several informal talks with ver.di over the past few weeks,&#39;&#39; Ms. Höger said during an interview. &#39;&#39;While we are willing to continue our conversation, we also see too little common ground for negotiations at the moment.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Heribert Jöris, the managing director of Handelsverband Deutschland, the main association representing employers in the German retailing industry, said he estimated the chances of a strike at Amazon&#39;s facilities as &#39;&#39;very high.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The employers&#39; association in January canceled a nationwide collective bargaining agreement covering workers at 100,000 retailing businesses, saying it wanted changes in compensation and work practices that date from the 1950s.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Employers and unions are expecting to begin negotiations on a new contract within weeks. Ver.di this year organized a strike by workers at Zara, the clothing retailer, and has threatened work stoppages at Globus, a discount chain, Mr. Jöris said. But in neither case have employers agreed to new wage pacts, he added.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I&#39;m pretty sure there will be strikes now,&#39;&#39; Mr. Jöris said. &#39;&#39;But that doesn&#39;t mean the strikes will be successful.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Vogels, a Dutchman who is based in Seattle, declined to comment on the labor situation at Amazon&#39;s retailing operations in Germany.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">The new engineers would be hired by a division of Amazon, Amazon Web Services, over the next 12 months. The developers would work for a new subsidiary, Amazon Development Center Germany, which would make applications and other software tools for customers of Amazon&#39;s cloud-computing business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon offers its European business customers like Royal Dutch Shell; Kempinski Hotels, a chain based in Geneva; and Unilever the option of storing their data in computing centers that it runs inside the European Union to satisfy a law that requires business to handle the data of E.U. citizens within the 27-nation bloc.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Jeremy Ward, a senior vice president for information technology at the Kempinski chain, which is majority owned by the sovereign wealth fund of Thailand, is in the middle of a five-year project to shift its corporate computer functions to Amazon&#39;s cloud.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Ward said Kempinski was on track to cut its annual I.T. costs by 40 percent as it moved functions like an internal employee telephone directory, training videos and corporate news, currently run by 143 Kempinski servers, into the cloud.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I think increasingly businesses are dropping their preconceived notions and are beginning to take advantage of the savings in the cloud,&#39;&#39; Mr. Ward said in an interview at the conference.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document NYTF000020130503e9530005x</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_093.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark180">Business Travel; SECTF</a><a name="bookmark181">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">In-Room Entertainment Turns Away From TV</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By JANE L.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">LEN MARKIDAN, a 26-year-old marketing consultant based in San Francisco, is the type of business traveler who forced LodgeNet, the hotel guest-room entertainment provider, to file recently for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Markidan, who spends 40 percent of his time traveling on business and is an elite participant in the Hilton and Hyatt loyalty programs, takes his MacBook Pro and iPad with him on the road and watches all television programs by streaming them on his laptop, using a portable router to extend the Wi-Fi signal in his hotel room.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;For a lot of people my age and a lot of people in general, the way we consume entertainment at home is changing,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I no longer have a cable subscription -- the way I watch entertainment at home is the same way I watch it on the road. I have a Hulu subscription, Amazon Prime and Netflix.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Guest-room entertainment &#39;&#39;is not an amenity that will drive my decision to stay at a hotel,&#39;&#39; he said, adding, &#39;&#39;I&#39;m a lot more concerned with loyalty program perks.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">James Lingle of Highlands Ranch, Colo., a consultant to hotel companies and guest-room entertainment service providers like LodgeNet&#39;s competitor iBahn, observed: &#39;&#39;If you look back, typically the first thing a guest would do when they walked into the door of a hotel room would be to turn on the TV. Now people bring their entertainment with them, tablet-based devices like an iPad, accounts and memberships like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, and they want to be able to use them.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">LodgeNet&#39;s decline directly reflects these changes. According to its bankruptcy filing, the number of hotel rooms it served globally dropped to 1.5 million in 2011 from 2 million in 2009. It provided guest-room entertainment services to most major hotel chains, usually by installing and maintaining free televisions and offering</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">video-on-demand entertainment, for which it and the hotels received fees. LodgeNet&#39;s sales in 2011 were $421.3 million, a 21 percent drop from a high of $533.9 million in 2008.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Colony Capital, a real estate and hotel investment firm in Los Angeles, led a group that invested $70 million in a controlling interest in LodgeNet, based in Sioux Falls, S.D., and brought in a management team of former Starwood, Fairmont and Hilton executives. LodgeNet, which emerged from bankruptcy in late March, also signed an agreement with DirecTV to jointly offer entertainment to hotels and hospitals.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The revamped LodgeNet faces strong competition from companies including Swisscom Hospitality Services, based in Geneva; iBahn, based in Salt Lake City; Guest-Tek, of Calgary, Alberta; and Roomlinx, based in Broomfield, Colo. All are developing systems that let travelers consume entertainment the way Mr. Markidan does</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">-- via the Internet, frequently through subscriptions they already have and use at home, either through Wi-Fi or a direct cable connection between their laptop or tablet and the guest-room television set.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Different types of hotels have different policies regarding Internet access. Many less expensive hotels offer it free, while more expensive ones often charge for it. What&#39;s expected to happen next, speaking broadly, is that using the Internet for e-mail will be free, while many hotels will charge for uses requiring a lot of bandwidth, like downloading or streaming videos, with the cost tied to the amount of bandwidth required.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We will give customers more short-form content at very attractive prices, affinity packages of sports channels, just-missed TV, video games, as well as movies currently in theaters,&#39;&#39; said Michael Ribero, Lodgenet&#39;s new chief</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">executive. &#39;&#39;We want to give them the opportunity to watch what they want, even if it&#39;s through Netflix and Amazon Prime.&#39;&#39; He said LodgeNet will no longer provide television equipment in hotel guest rooms in exchange for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">video-on-demand fees. Instead, DirecTV will offer hotel owners lease financing for TVs, freeing capital that LodgeNet can invest in product and service improvements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">C. Scott Hansen, director of guest technology for Marriott International, said his company&#39;s objective over the next several years was to connect every guest-room TV to the Internet. Marriott International also plans to limit the number of TV channels its brands offer to a targeted, all-high-definition lineup and to augment these with</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Internet-based, streaming content, via services like Netflix and YouTube.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Bandwidth capacity at many Marriott International hotels will need to be increased to support these services, an expense Mr. Hansen said would be offset by guests&#39; purchases of Internet access, commissions paid by services like Netflix for signing up new members and advertising revenue from companies that could use the TV or guest&#39;s laptop or tablet screen for messages.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Josh Weiss, vice president of brand and guest technology for Hilton Worldwide, said his company offered a broad range of short, low-price TV programs, similar to those available from Netflix or iTunes, in many hotels, provided by LodgeNet and others. This content costs $2 to $5, far less than a full-length movie. Hilton Worldwide also offers a free, DirecTV service similar to DirecTV&#39;s residential service at over 150 hotels across most of its brands and plans to expand this service this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mike Blake, chief information officer of Commune Hotels and Resorts, said the company was considering keeping track of guests&#39; channel preferences, which would automatically come up whenever a guest turned on the TV in the hotel room. He said this service, which guests could opt in for, should be available by the fourth quarter of this year. Other new services under consideration include the ability to customize music playlists for guests and to stream personal photos on guest room TVs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Apple TV in hotel rooms at the Aloft Cupertino, a Starwood hotel, lets guests play video and music and display photos from any Apple device on their television set. Starwood is evaluating offering this system and additional entertainment options at other Aloft and Starwood hotels.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">CitizenM, a Dutch chain of what it calls &#39;&#39;affordable luxury&#39;&#39; hotels -- now all in Europe, with two slated to open in Manhattan this year and next -- provides a Samsung tablet in each guest room, with technology from Swisscom that provides a music library and free video-on-demand TV and also controls the blinds, lighting and temperature.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The 85-year-old Peninsula Hong Kong this month will finish installation of a guest-room entertainment system that Ingvar Herland, Peninsula Hotels&#39; general manager of research and technology, said costs $10,000 to $25,000 a room. This proprietary system features fully customizable bedside and desk tablets preset in a choice of five languages, with six more to follow this year. The tablet allows the guest to order room, concierge and housekeeping services, and to control lighting, curtains, the temperature and privacy options. It also provides -- via a flat-screen, Blu-ray, LED television -- terrestrial programming, 90 international television channels, 450 Internet radio stations, free HD and 3-D movies, as well as free international voice-over-Internet protocol telephone calls.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Herland said the new system would be offered at the Peninsula Paris, opening next year, and would eventually replace existing systems at other Peninsula hotels.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Travelers should not expect a proliferation of new services like the Peninsula&#39;s, said Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">He said that although hotels in the United States this year were expected to spend a record percentage of profits on capital expenditures -- like entertainment systems -- profits per room also were expected to remain well below their 2006 peak. Companies offering new systems &#39;&#39;that are expensive for hotel owners are doing so at a challenging time,&#39;&#39; he said, adding that many hotel owners would consider premium cable service as an alternative.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">One vanishing option is sex-related entertainment. Omni banned such programs in 1999, citing its support of &#39;&#39;pro-family issues,&#39;&#39; while Marriott International stopped offering it last year. &#39;&#39;If you want it, you can access it online on your own,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Hansen of Marriott.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">FAMILIAR: Len Markidan, a marketing consultant, says his travel entertainment is the same as at home: &#39;&#39;a Hulu subscription, Amazon Prime and Netflix.&#39;&#39; (PHOTOGRAPH BY MATT ROTH FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES);</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">DIGITAL AMENITIES: Interactive tablets at the Peninsula Hong Kong hotel.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">CORRECTION APPENDEDAnita Demetropoulos, a Maine shopkeeper, figured she would never see the day when her most relentless competitor, Amazon, would be forced to collect sales tax.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Now that Congress seems ready to do that, she is no longer sure it matters. Even in losing, the e-commerce powerhouse is triumphant. It no longer needs the tax break to vanquish its foes -- and could even make money by collecting the new taxes for other retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I&#39;m surprised and glad this is happening,&#39;&#39; said Ms. Demetropoulos, who owns three toy stores with her husband. &#39;&#39;But Amazon won&#39;t rest until it gobbles up everyone and everything.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The Senate is poised to pass a bill to require all but the smallest online sellers to collect the tax. The House appears likely to follow suit. Although Amazon&#39;s desire to avoid the tax played a fundamental role in its founding and growth, it is a supporter of the legislation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As it builds new warehouses and extends its already considerable reach, Amazon is relying less on price than speedy delivery, free shipping and a selection that encompasses just about everything. Small retailers say Amazon was always a significant opponent, and is now a fearsome one.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It&#39;s beyond frustrating that Congress waited until Amazon became so dominant that having a massive tax advantage is no longer essential to its strategy,&#39;&#39; said Stacy Mitchell, a senior researcher with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. &#39;&#39;The right time to fix this was a decade ago, when it could have saved many local businesses.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Analysts who closely follow the fortunes of Amazon say collecting taxes is unlikely to drive away its customers. They say it may even help the Seattle company while simultaneously defusing a potent political issue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the few states where the company has already begun collecting, said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, sales dip for about a year. &#39;&#39;Then the customers come back for the convenience and selection,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Figuring out the tax in thousands of jurisdictions could be a logistical nightmare for merchants just above the legislation&#39;s threshold of $1 million in annual out-sf-state sales. That is another place where Amazon is expected to benefit; it could sell tax collection services to tens of thousands of third parties.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For some store owners, the digital world&#39;s momentum can seem overpowering.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ms. Demetropoulos tried to sell specialty toys online, but business dwindled as Amazon sought out her competitors and signed them up to sell through its Web site. The company courted her as well. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m like, &#39;Are you kidding?&#39; &#39;&#39; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Customers come into one of the branches of Island Treasure Toys, she said, scan a toy on their smartphone, and inform the sales clerk that Amazon sells it cheaper. Would the store be willing to make a deal?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">The tax will not help this situation much, which is regularly played out in all kinds of stores across the country. If retailers say no, Amazon often gets the business.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon reported this week that its first-quarter revenue rose 22 percent, to $16.07 billion, an amazing increase for a retailer of its size. Wal-Mart, by contrast, is expecting no sales growth at all this quarter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;This is the moment when Internet commerce was finally forced to stand on its own two feet,&#39;&#39; said Michael Mazerov, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who wrote the definitive report on Amazon&#39;s long-held intransigence on the issue. &#39;&#39;But it&#39;s coming very late in the game.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Under the current system, an Internet company has to collect taxes only in states where it has a physical location. For most companies, that means the state in which it has its headquarters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">When Jeff Bezos had the idea for Amazon in the mid-1990s, he explored setting up shop on a tax-free Indian reservation. Foiled in that goal, Mr. Bezos chose the State of Washington, which had an abundance of software programmers but a relatively small population. &#39;&#39;It made no sense for us to be in California or New York,&#39;&#39; he explained in an unguarded 1996 interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">For years, Amazon rejected the notion that it should collect money in states where it had no employees. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s not fair,&#39;&#39; Mr. Bezos told stockholders in 2008.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Consumers are supposed to add up their Internet purchases and pay the appropriate tax directly to their state revenue collectors. In practice, however, few do, and enforcement is minimal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In recent years, states struggling in the recession became more aggressive toward Amazon. Texas, New York and California all pursued the company over the tax issue. Amazon began making deals to collect the tax while simultaneously building warehouses that would bring it closer to its customers, bringing same-day delivery within reach.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Andy Ross, the former owner of Cody&#39;s, the famous Berkeley bookstore that went out of business in 2008, sees &#39;&#39;a little irony&#39;&#39; in these developments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;As always, Amazon is nimble enough to make lemons out of lemonade,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Ross, who was regularly outraged by the tax issue when he was competing against the e-commerce company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;But there is no question that the free ride it received for 18 years on the sales tax issue gave it a huge competitive advantage.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Last August, an Amazon executive testified before Congress that all &#39;&#39;sellers should compete on a level playing field&#39;&#39; and that the states really needed the tax money, which was estimated to be more than $10 billion annually. When the Senate introduced the legislation in February, Amazon wrote to the sponsoring senators to thank them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Thomas J. Szkutak, Amazon&#39;s chief financial officer, dismissed any ill effect from legislation, telling reporters this week that &#39;&#39;certainly we&#39;ll continue to have a good business in those states.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">EBay, Amazon&#39;s close competitor, has fought the bill, saying the threshold to collect the tax should have been substantially higher than $1 million in revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">For some eBay sellers, the legislation is less about leveling the playing field than permanently tilting it against them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;This is all about the big Internet companies -- Amazon, Walmart -- crushing the small companies,&#39;&#39; said Chris Chapman, who sells winter sports equipment on eBay, Amazon and through his own Web site, SnowSportDeals.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">His sales are slightly over the threshold. That means Mr. Chapman, who is based in Maryland, will either have to spend many hours figuring out how to collect taxes himself or pay someone to do it for him.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;This will make it harder for people like me to start a Web business,&#39;&#39; Mr. Chapman said. &#39;&#39;So Amazon will just get more customers. It&#39;s win-win for them.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Correction: May 2, 2013, Thursday</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the likely passage of a federal bill to require some online retailers to collect out-of-state sales tax described incorrectly which retailers</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">would be required to collect the tax.

Even in losing, the e-commerce powerhouse is triumphant. It no longer needs the tax break to vanquish its foes — and could even make money by collecting the new taxes for other retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“I’m surprised and glad this is happening,” said Ms. Demetropoulos, who owns three toy stores with her husband. “But Amazon won’t rest until it gobbles up everyone and everything.”</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/743" class="s1" target="_blank">The Senate is poised to pass </a><a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/743" class="a" target="_blank">a bill to require</a> <span style=" color: #000;">all but the smallest online sellers to collect the tax. The House appears likely to follow suit. Although Amazon’s desire to avoid the tax played a fundamental role in its founding and growth, it is a supporter of the legislation.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As it builds new warehouses and extends its already considerable reach, Amazon is relying less on price than speedy delivery, free shipping and a selection that encompasses just about everything. Small retailers say Amazon was always a significant opponent, and is now a fearsome one.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“It’s beyond frustrating that Congress waited until Amazon became so dominant that having a massive tax advantage is no longer essential to its strategy,” said Stacy Mitchell, a senior researcher with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. “The right time to fix this was a decade ago, when it could have saved many local businesses.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Analysts who closely follow the fortunes of Amazon say collecting taxes is unlikely to drive away its customers. They say it may even help the Seattle company while simultaneously defusing a potent political issue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">In the few states where the company has already begun collecting, said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, sales dip for about a year. “Then the customers come back for the convenience and selection,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Figuring out the tax in thousands of jurisdictions could be a logistical nightmare for merchants just above the legislation’s threshold of $1 million in annual out-sf-state sales. That is another place where Amazon is expected to benefit; it could sell tax collection services to tens of thousands of third parties.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For some store owners, the digital world’s momentum can seem overpowering.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Ms. Demetropoulos tried to sell specialty toys online, but business dwindled as Amazon sought out her competitors and signed them up to sell through its Web site. The company courted her as well. “I’m like, ‘Are you kidding?’ ” she said.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.islandtreasuretoys.com/page/about_us/" class="s1" target="_blank">Customers come into one of the branches of </a>Island Treasure Toys<span class="p">, she said, scan a toy on their smartphone, and inform the sales clerk that Amazon sells it cheaper. Would the store be willing to make a deal?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">The tax will not help this situation much, which is regularly played out in all kinds of stores across the country. If retailers say no, Amazon often gets the business.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon reported this week that its first-quarter revenue rose 22 percent, to $16.07 billion, an amazing increase for a retailer of its size. Wal-Mart, by contrast, is expecting no sales growth at all this quarter.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2990" class="s1" target="_blank">“This is the moment when Internet commerce was finally forced to stand on its own two feet,” said Michael Mazerov, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who wrote the </a><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2990" class="a" target="_blank">definitive report</a> <span style=" color: #000;">on Amazon’s long-held intransigence on the issue. “But it’s coming very late in the game.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Under the current system, an Internet company has to collect taxes only in states where it has a physical location.

Foiled in that goal, Mr. Bezos chose the State of Washington, which had an abundance of software programmers but a relatively small population. “It made no sense for us to be in California or New York,” he explained in an unguarded 1996 interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">For years, Amazon rejected the notion that it should collect money in states where it had no employees. “It’s not fair,” Mr. Bezos told stockholders in 2008.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Consumers are supposed to add up their Internet purchases and pay the appropriate tax directly to their state revenue collectors.

The device will most likely showcase Amazon’s own online video offerings, which include Prime Instant Video, a Netflix-like subscription video service with more than 40,000 movies and television episodes that is included as part of Amazon’s broader Prime membership.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Among other benefits, Prime members, who pay $79 a year, get free two-day shipping on orders bought through Amazon’s site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon also offers a broader library of video content, totaling 150,000 titles, that anyone, including people who are not Prime members, can buy and rent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">But Amazon’s video services are already available on hundreds of devices, many of which connect to television sets, like game consoles, digital video recorders and Blu-ray players.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">An app for using Amazon’s video service is even embedded in some television sets, including models from Sony, Panasonic and Samsung.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Although Amazon was an early entrant in the e-reader market with the Kindle, the company is late to the market for set-top boxes, where the incumbents include Apple’s Apple TV device and a family of products from Roku.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon, though, has considerable strengths and has shown an aptitude for reinventing itself in new categories, like cloud computing and tablet computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">One media executive who has participated in discussions with Amazon about its set-top box said he thought the company’s standing as a top shopping destination would allow it to promote its new device and give it a strong chance of attracting an audience.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company could use other creative techniques for getting its set-top box into more living rooms.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said one approach that could make sense was for Amazon to sell the device for $100 or less, about what Internet set-top boxes cost today, and to include a free year of its subscription video service.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">At the end of the term, customers would have an incentive to sign up for Amazon Prime to continue receiving all of its membership benefits, including the video service. ‘‘I think this is a Trojan horse to get people to join Prime,’’ Mr. Pachter said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130426e94q00006</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_098.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark190">Technology</a><a name="bookmark191">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s Profit Falls as It Spends Heavily on Projects</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By NICK WINGFIELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">631 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">26 April 2013 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013.

The stock eventually ended up falling about 3 percent in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">after-hours trading.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon said its net income for the first quarter, which ended March 31, fell to $82 million, or 18 cents a share, from $130 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 22 percent to $16.07 billion from $13.18 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">While the company’s profit was better than analysts had expected, its revenue fell slightly short. Wall Street analysts expected Amazon to report earnings of 9 cents a share and revenue of $16.16 billion, according to an average of their estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon previously told analysts to expect its sales to grow to between $15 billion and $16.6 billion, or somewhere from 15 to 26 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It’s more of the same from Amazon,” said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Company.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Mr. Sebastian added that the waves of investments that Amazon was making were unlikely to abate soon. “That’s going to be a continuing trend,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The seeming indifference of many investors to Amazon’s slim profits shows how much more effective the company has been at articulating its vision of future opportunities to Wall Street than another tech favorite, Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Apple, which made a profit 116 times bigger than that of Amazon last quarter, has been plagued by investor doubts about its growth prospects, driving its stock down 33 percent over the l ast year.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s shares are up 38 percent in that period.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said investors had been reassured by comments from Amazon management that suggested the company was not being hurt as much by weakness in European economies as another e-commerce giant, eBay. “That’s an acknowledgment that the growth outlook for Amazon remains quite robust,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon is spending heavily on fulfillment centers to speed delivery of physical goods to customers. It is also investing aggressively in data centers to expand its Amazon Web Services business, which provides start-ups and big corporate clients with computers and bandwidth they can rent as needed for their online initiatives.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Then there are the consumer devices that are becoming an increasingly important part of Amazon’s plan to deliver media electronically to customers. The company’s Kindle e-readers are now a full-blown family of tablet computers, which it sells for little or no profit, with the goal of making money over the long term by selling books, movies, music and other services.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/technology/amazon-plans-an-internet-video-device.html?_r=0" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon is also </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/technology/amazon-plans-an-internet-video-device.html?_r=0" class="a" target="_blank">developing</a> <span style=" color: #000;">a television set-top box that it is expected to announce in the fall, a device that could give its video services a more meaningful audience in living rooms.

For music, for example, users can find and download songs and upload their own music library to an online locker, where Samsung will scan and match the library with songs in its own catalog so users do not have to repurchase them. (That’s similar to Apple’s matching service, iTunes Match.)</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/samsung-galaxy-s4-review-roundup/" class="s1" target="_blank">Although Samsung has found success selling devices and accessories, it has little experience in e-commerce, and technology reviewers have said it is especially </a>weak in designing software<span class="p">. It’s uncertain whether people will feel confident about buying digital content through a Samsung store.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“They are less strong than Apple or Google when it comes to content, media, applications, getting developers to write applications,” said Charles Golvin, a mobile analyst at Forrester Research.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Golvin said that Samsung was at a disadvantage because it was opening its store long after the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">competition. And its top rivals have particular strengths: Apple’s iTunes Store is extremely successful with music, Amazon dominates the e-book business and Google Play has become a vibrant destination for downloading Android apps.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Consumers make investments of time and money in ecosystems that make it harder for them to leave a company’s products, Mr. Golvin said. For example, people who bought a lot of books from Amazon for a Kindle device will be unlikely to want to buy e-books elsewhere.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“If you’re a glass-half-full person, it’s loyalty, and if you’re a glass-half-empty person, it’s lock-in,” Mr. Golvin said. “In order to secure the greatest possible loyalty or lock-in, you need all of those components working in your favor.”</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Samsung’s relationship with Google in particular is growing more complicated by the day, Mr. Golvin said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">“Google is to some extent reliant on Samsung as the dominant seller of Android phones,” he said. “At the same time, Samsung is reliant on Google for the larger Android ecosystem, people building Android apps and delivering them through Play.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Samsung Hub will be a direct competitor to Google Play. Mr. Golvin said either company’s next move could be equally competitive. Samsung could strike out on its own, using a platform called Tizen instead of Android. Or Motorola, owned by Google, could make Android phones that rival Samsung’s.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/google-buys-e-commerce-company-to-improve-shopping-search/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/google-buys-e-commerce-company-to-improve-shopping-search/" target="_blank">Google Buys E-Commerce Company to Improve Shopping Search</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/do-people-actually-shop-on-phones-the-answer-is-decidedly-yes/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/do-people-actually-shop-on-phones-the-answer-is-decidedly-yes/" target="_blank">Do People Actually Shop on Phones?

One media executive who has participated in discussions with Amazon about its set-top box said he thought the company’s standing as a top shopping destination would allow it to promote its new device and give it a strong chance of attracting an audience.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company could use other creative techniques for getting its set-top box into more living rooms.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said one approach that could make sense was for Amazon to sell the device for $100 or less, about what Internet set-top boxes cost today, and to include a free year of its subscription video service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">At the end of the term, customers would have an incentive to sign up for Amazon Prime to continue receiving all of its membership benefits, including the video service. “I think this is a Trojan horse to get people to join Prime,” Mr. Pachter said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amy Chozick contributed reporting from New York.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/business/media/saturday-night-live-archives-moving-to-yahoo.html" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><span class="s3">Streaming on Yahoo, It’s ‘S.N.L.’</span> Document NYTFEED020130425e94p0005o</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 1/Image_101.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark196">U.S.</a><a name="bookmark197">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Unraveling Boston Suspects’ Online Lives, Link by Link</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">By MICHIKO KAKUTANI</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">1,424 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">24 April 2013 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013.

And once the search focused on Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the brothers’ social media postings provided a rich vein of material to mine and sift.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://twitter.com/j_tsar" class="s1" target="_blank">There are more than a thousand messages on Dzhokhar’s </a><a href="https://twitter.com/j_tsar" class="a" target="_blank">Twitter account</a> <a href="http://vk.com/id160300242" class="s1" target="_blank">in addition to a </a><a href="http://vk.com/id160300242" class="a" target="_blank">profile page</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/muazseyfullah" class="s1" target="_blank">on VKontakte, a popular Russian social networking site, and in Tamerlan’s case, a list of </a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/muazseyfullah" class="a" target="_blank">favorite videos</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/1PNVMAW2D4CT1/ref%3Dcm_wl_sb_v?reveal=all&amp;filter=all&amp;sort=date-added&amp;layout=standard&amp;.x=29&amp;.y=19" class="s1" target="_blank">on YouTube and what appears to be an Amazon </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/1PNVMAW2D4CT1/ref%3Dcm_wl_sb_v?reveal=all&amp;filter=all&amp;sort=date-added&amp;layout=standard&amp;.x=29&amp;.y=19" class="a" target="_blank">wish list</a> <span style=" color: #000;">belonging to him (Amazon would not confirm whose list it was, citing its privacy policy.)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">These posts instantly became dots that people began trying to connect. Some details ratified the views of those former friends and neighbors who said they were utterly shocked at the brothers’ possible involvement in such a horrifying crime. Other posts pointed to Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s growing interest in Islamic radicalism and possibly a dark subtext to the friendly, boy-next-door affect of Dzhokhar.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">At the same time, they were reminders of the complexities of online identity — of the ways in which people strike poses and don masks on the Web (which can sometimes turn into self-fulfilling prophecies), and the ways in which the Web can magnify or accelerate users’ interests and preoccupations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The younger brother, Dzhokhar, in particular, seemed utterly immersed in American pop culture, and concerned with the sorts of things that preoccupy many young men — girls (“miss u.s.a. is so sexy”) and good times (“I am the best beer pong player in Cambridge. I am the #truth”). In fact, much of his Twitter feed is distinctive only in its ordinariness — ordinariness that stands in such startling contrast to the horror of what happened last week in Boston.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">There are lots of references to musicians like Chris Brown, Jay-Z and Michael Jackson; television shows like “Breaking Bad” and “Game of Thrones,” and movies like “Spider-Man” and “Finding Nemo.” He prattles away about Nutella and Frosted Flakes, complains about typos and losing his remote. “Pop-up adds are the worst, on par with mosquitoes,” he tweets on June 17, 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Given the layers of irony, sarcasm and joking often employed on Twitter, it can be difficult to parse the messages of a stranger. Yet some of them can seem menacing or portentous, given what we now suspect: “a decade in america already, I want out,” “Never underestimate the rebel with a cause” or, drawing from lyrics from a Kendrick Lamar song, “No one is really violent until they’re with the homies.” But others suggest a more Holden</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Caulfield-like adolescent alienation: “some people are just misunderstood by the world thus the increase of suicide rates.” Sometimes, Dzhokhar sounds downright sentimental (unless, of course, he is being ironic): “There are enough worms for all the birds stop killing each other for ‘em.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Parts of Dzhokhar’s VKontakte page are harsher and more serious. Under personal priority, it says “Career and money.” Under worldview, it says “Islam.” There is a link to a video indicating outrage at the violence in Syria, and a link to an Islamic Web site that says “And do good, for Allah loves those who do good.” Another video features a blind boy talking to an older man, saying he believes his blindness will be absolved on Judgment Day; the man starts to cry, and wonders how many people who have their sight are as committed to the study of the Koran as the boy.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Other posts on Dzhokhar’s page have a more sardonic edge. There is a link to a self-described “journal of sarcasm” called “Evil Corporation” (featuring a logo reminiscent of Angry Birds) and also a joke that goes like this: “A car goes by with a Chechen, a Dagestani and an Ingush inside. Question: Who is driving?” Answer: The police.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The videos linked to on Tamerlan’s YouTube page — created in August 2012, shortly after a trip to Russia — are far more militant, and hint at a growing radicalization. About seven months ago, he posted a couple of videos of Timur Mucuraev, whom The Washington Post has called “the bard of Chechen separatism.” Five months ago, he posted a video (subsequently deleted) under the subheading “Terrorists.” The video featured a militant named Abu Dujana (a k a Gadzhimurad Dolgatov), who was killed by Russian security services. The video shows the leader in sunglasses, flanked by two others, their faces hidden by balaclavas, brandishing automatic weapons.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/complete_coverage/harry_potter/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" class="s1" target="_blank">Four months ago, a link went up on Tamerlan’s YouTube page to a video called “The Emergence of Prophecy: The Black Flags from Khorasan.” The black flags refer to a kind of Armageddon-like prophecy reportedly embraced by Al Qaeda — about jihadis rising up from Central Asia to defeat the infidels. A video link featuring the radical Islamic preacher Feiz Muhammad has been removed in the past several days; it included a denunciation of the </a><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/complete_coverage/harry_potter/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" class="a" target="_blank">Harry Potter</a> <span style=" color: #000;">books and movies as glorifying “paganism and evil” and teaching “children the drinking of unicorn blood and magic.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">As for what appears to be Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s Amazon wish list page, it is a weird jumble of self-help books (Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People”), covert-operations-style manuals (“The I.D. Forger: Homemade Birth Certificates and Other Documents Explained”), Chechen history books (“Allah’s Mountains: The Battle for Chechnya, New Edition”), Mafia books (Nicholas Pileggi’s “Wiseguy”) and books about the Roman Empire (“The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire”). There is Boethius’s “Consolation of Philosophy” — a staple of college curriculums that addresses ideas of good and evil and free will — and “Snatch,” the “inside story of the making of the smash-hit movie starring Brad Pitt.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Did Tamerlan harbor macho dreams of being an action hero, or a Mafia operative? Did he want to read Boethius to grapple with deep existential doubts he was having, or was he assigned it in school? (The books all appear to have been added to the Amazon list in 2006 and 2007.) Did his interest in the Roman Empire have something to do with a conviction that the West was decadent and in decline?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">For that matter, does this Amazon wish list really belong to him? Or does our fascination with the list simply reflect our own desire to gain insight into his thinking, our hunger for more dots to try to connect? Indeed, online and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">off-line conversations around the nation last week were filled with hypotheses, theories and deconstructions as to why the Tsarnaev brothers might have committed the terrible acts they are suspected of. There were shrewd Nancy Drew-like insights, dangerous red herrings (which hurt some innocent people and underscored the dark side of crowd-sourcing and the mob mentality that can infect the Web) and silly speculation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">People drew analogies between the Tsarnaevs and such varied siblings as the twins in the David Cronenberg film “Dead Ringers,” the title characters in Dostoyevsky’s “Brothers Karamazov,” and the Corleones in “The Godfather.” A Twitter message posted by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hours after the marathon bombings (“Ain’t no love in the heart of the city, stay safe people”), prompted some amateur detectives to wonder if that reference to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Jay-Z’s song “Heart of the City (Ain’t No Love)” is a direct allusion to 9/11, since the album containing that song was released on Sept. 11, 2001.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/facebook_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org" class="s1" target="_blank">America has processed the Boston Marathon bombings in different ways from the terror attacks of 9/11 — in part because the level of digital sophistication has grown so exponentially since then (in 2001, there was no YouTube, no </a>Facebook<span class="p">, no Twitter).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The social media droppings the Tsarnaev brothers left behind not only attest to their own immersion in the interactive, electronic world, but they have also provided everyone else with plenty of digital data from which to try to extract patterns and possible meaning — fulfilling that very human need to try to make narrative sense of the tragic and the overwhelming.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Finn Cohen contributed reporting from New York, and Andrew E.

To him, </a><u>Apple</u><span style=" color: #000;">’s product is a clear leader in the market, while Amazon is the retailer he uses most. Amazon’s shares are up nearly 40 percent over the last 12 months, while Apple’s are down nearly 30 percent over the same period. So why have their stock prices diverged so much when both companies appear to be at the top of their game?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Growth is the most common answer you will hear. When a company convinces investors that its earnings can keep going up, an enthusiasm grows around the shares, and they tend to perform well. Wall Street analysts expect Amazon’s earnings next year to be 66 percent higher than the forecast for 2013. They project a 10 percent uptick for Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But there is another conversation you need to have.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It revolves around whether the market has already factored the hoped-for growth into the stock price. It is possible to pay too much for excellence.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">There are all sorts of ways to gauge how much credibility investors ascribe to a company’s “growth story.” One is to look at what investors are paying now for a company’s free cash flows, or the hard dollars it takes in from profits (minus the spending it does on plant and equipment).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">The results are stark. Apple’s stock market value is nine times last year’s free cash flows. On this metric, Amazon is at over 300 times. Sane investors would never touch a stock with such a dear valuation unless they felt cash flows were going to soar in the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">And this brings us to the part of investing that usually separates winners from losers: guessing whether companies will actually do what we expect them to.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Amazon’s believers don’t mind that it’s spending such huge amounts on setting up new operations for its retail and data businesses. At some point, hopefully in the not too distant future, that spending will fall as the expansion reaches its limits. In that case, Amazon will be churning out much bigger cash flows as it enjoys near unassailable dominance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Sure, but how wondrous will those cash flows be? Amazon’s operations produced $4.2 billion of cash flows last year. Let’s generously assume 10 percent annual growth for them, which would take them to $5.1 billion by the end of 2014.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Let’s be kind again and assume that capital expenditures fall a lot, to, say, $1 billion a year, from last year’s $3.8 billion. Free cash flows in 2014 would therefore total $4.1 billion.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=GOOG&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="s1" target="_blank">Now, remember, at this future point, Amazon’s growth in free cash flow will have slowed a lot. Investors will probably decide to attach a lower valuation to the company. Being generous, let’s assume they value those hypothetical 2014 free cash flows at 21 times, </a>Google<span class="p">’s multiple today. That would give Amazon a market worth of about $86 billion. That’s 30 percent lower than today.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Of course, the stock market believes what it wants to believe. It may well decide to remain starry-eyed about Amazon and give it a much higher valuation for years to come. But Apple’s recent drubbing suggests even the strongest runs can end nastily.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/einhorn-supports-apples-big-payouts/" class="a" target="_blank">Einhorn Supports Apple’s Big </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/einhorn-supports-apples-big-payouts/" target="_blank">Payouts</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">In Apple Fight, Einhorn Unveils ‘iPrefs’<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020130424e94o002mh</span></p></li></ul></body></html>
