STEWART</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,524 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">21 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Robert Sindelar, the bearded, redheaded managing partner at the Seattle independent bookseller Third Place Books — definitely a David to Amazon’s Goliath — got the idea to take on Amazon while attending BookExpo America in New York a few weeks ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘As you can imagine, all anyone was talking about was the standoff between Hachette and Amazon,’’ he told me in the past week, referring to the much-publicized impasse in contentious negotiations between the publisher and the giant Internet bookseller. ‘‘I wanted to do something positive that would take advantage of this.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times revealed last month that Amazon seemed to be discouraging sales of Hachette books by failing to stock them, delaying delivery and removing preorder buttons from its website. Exactly what the dispute involves has been shrouded in secrecy, but price is clearly at the center. Hachette and Amazon seem to be locked in the kind of intense negotiations that are common between manufacturers and retailers in most businesses, but have attracted enormous attention because of the visibility and cultural significance of books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I spoke to someone involved on the Hachette side of the negotiations who is under orders not to discuss them and asked not to be named. This person said that Amazon had been demanding payments for a range of services, including the preorder button, personalized recommendations and a dedicated employee at Amazon for Hachette books. This is similar to so-called co-op arrangements with traditional retailers, like paying Barnes &amp; Noble for placing a book in the front of the store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon ‘‘is very inventive about what we’d call standard service,’’ this person said. ‘‘They’re teasing out all these layers and saying, ‘If you want that service, you’ll have to pay for it.’ In the end, it’s very hard to know what you’d be paying. Hachette has refused, and so bit by bit, they’ve been taking away these services, like the preorder button, to teach Hachette a lesson.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What bothered Mr. Sindelar wasn’t that Amazon’s tactics were so hard-boiled. Rather, ‘‘our goal as retailers is to connect people to books,’’ he said. ‘‘The notion that a retailer would obstruct readers from getting to certain books they want completely violates our ethics as retailers. I wondered how we could get that message across to customers.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So Mr. Sindelar went to Hachette’s publishing list, looking for the next potential blockbuster. At the Hachette subsidiary Little, Brown and Company, he found ‘‘The Silkworm’’ by Robert Galbraith — a.k.a. J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series — the follow-up to her best seller, ‘‘The Cuckoo’s Calling.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘That seemed obvious,’’ he said. ‘‘Ordinarily, we wouldn’t get any preorders for a book like that. Zero. But Amazon had deleted its preorder button, so I thought we could capitalize on that.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Third Place Books began featuring ‘‘The Silkworm’’ on the home page of its website, offering hardcover copies at a 20 percent discount along with free, in-person delivery the day the book was released, which was Thursday. Mr. Sindelar, along with several other store employees, delivered the books. He also handed out what he called ‘‘Hachette swag bags’’ with a T-shirt and advance copy of a coming Hachette novel. Some buyers also received a surprise visit from a local author, Maria Semple, who wrote the best-selling book ‘‘Where’d You Go, Bernadette.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I thought this would show what we as booksellers stand for,’’ Mr. Sindelar said. ‘‘While Amazon is blocking people, we literally put the book in their hands. But we’re not asking people to boycott Amazon. We’re in Seattle and Amazon is a big part of the local economy. We’re sensitive to that.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So Third Place Books didn’t participate in the campaign to place ‘‘I didn’t buy it on Amazon’’ stickers on books that the comedian Stephen Colbert started this month on his show on Comedy Central. (Hachette is Mr. Colbert’s publisher, and the sticker campaign is backed by the American Booksellers Association.) ‘‘We decided not to get down in the mud with everybody else,’’ Mr. Sindelar said. ‘‘I’m tired of defining ourselves in terms of being different from Amazon. I thought this was a healthy, positive way to show how we operate and what we value.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Sindelar’s efforts to gain at the expense of a major rival like Amazon could also be described in another healthy, positive way: competition. Amazon’s decision to take a hard line with Hachette seems to have provided a sudden competitive advantage for other booksellers, large and small.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Walmart.com on Thursday, ‘‘The Silkworm’’ was one of three books featured on the books home page at 40 percent off, or $16.80. Walmart has also promoted the book with ads on Facebook and through mass emails to its customers promoting Hachette books. On Barnes &amp; Noble’s site, ‘‘The Silkworm’’ was one of four of ‘‘the week’s biggest books.’’ A digital edition for the Nook was $11.99. On Bookish, the website that the major publishers started last year to combat Amazon, it was the first ‘‘new and notable’’ release featured, and was selling for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$19.60.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon showed no sign of backing down. On Thursday, it was selling ‘‘The Silkworm’’ in hardback for $25.20 — nearly the full suggested retail price — along with the message that delivery could take ‘‘2 to 4 weeks.’’ (The Kindle digital edition was $9.99.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All of this must be warming the hearts of antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which was widely criticized after it filed an antitrust case against five major publishers and Apple, accusing them of conspiring to raise e-book prices. The five publishers — Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon &amp; Schuster (all the so-called majors except Random House) — settled the charges with the department and agreed not to collude. Apple was found guilty after a lengthy trial. (It is appealing the decision.) A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the Amazon-Hachette dispute.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To many, especially publishers, authors and booksellers, it seemed perverse that the government sued the major publishers and Apple, whose iBookstore was a new entrant into digital publishing, and not Amazon, which seemed to be rapidly amassing quasi-monopoly power in book retailing. But as Judge Denise Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled, the evidence was overwhelming that the publishers’ and Apple’s goal wasn’t to promote competition, but to raise e-book prices so that Apple wouldn’t lose money and so that e-book sales wouldn’t undercut the far more profitable sales of hardcover books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She noted that monopoly power isn’t illegal unless it’s gained unlawfully, in which case the publishers and Apple should have filed a complaint with the government, rather than conspiring to raise prices. ‘‘Another company’s alleged violation of antitrust laws is not an excuse for engaging in your own violations of law,’’ she ruled. ‘‘Antitrust laws were enacted for the ‘protection of competition, not competitors,’’’ she continued, quoting a famous Supreme Court case.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next big test for Hachette and Amazon will probably arrive in the coming week, when Little, Brown will publish ‘‘Invisible’’ by the mega-best-selling author James Patterson and the novelist David Ellis. The book isn’t available for preorder on Amazon, although a 28-page preview is free on Kindle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon confirmed on its website that it was not taking preorders for Hachette books. In its statement, it said that it was ‘‘the right of a retailer to determine whether the terms on offer are acceptable and to stock items accordingly.’’ And while Hachette is the lone publisher in the current standoff, other contracts between Amazon and major publishers will soon be expiring. (There’s nothing illegal about publishers’ adopting similar stances in their negotiations, as long as they don’t collude.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whether even the combined efforts of the publishers and competitive efforts of rival retailers can dent Amazon’s market power remains to be seen. (Amazon accounts for about a third of book sales in the United States and 60 percent of Hachette’s digital sales.) The person involved in the Hachette negotiations wasn’t optimistic for the publishers. In previous rounds with Amazon, ‘‘We had so little leverage. It felt like I had a slingshot and they had a tank. We’d fight and fight and then we’d make concessions. They rolled over us.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Who’s going to blink first?’’ mused Mr. Sindelar, the independent bookseller. ‘‘That’s what everyone wants to know. I have no idea. But a lot of our customers told us they were buying from us explicitly as a protest against Amazon. We live in Seattle, where people go to farmers’ markets. They don’t want to limit the diversity of where they shop. I think this has helped people realize that if Amazon is the only option, that’s putting way too much power in one company.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140620ea6l0009k</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_004.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2">finance</a><a name="bookmark3">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon phone is a tough call for Europe; Vodafone and Telefónica consider Fire, though its appeal may not translate</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MARK SCOTT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">637 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">20 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">18</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

And despite efforts by other technology giants like Microsoft to break into the smartphone market, Europeans still favor devices made by the market leaders, Apple and Samsung.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It’s already a pretty crowded market,’’ said Neil Mawston, an analyst with the technology researchers Strategy Analytics. ‘‘Amazon will have to pull out all the stops to make an impression.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon rolled out a number of new features in the hopes of winning market share from Apple and Samsung.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of them, a product recognition feature, allows users to scan images of items like books, DVDs and food using the smartphone’s camera and buy the products on Amazon’s website.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While the phone’s e-commerce feature may prove enticing to Americans accustomed to buying goods online, the service may be less successful in Europe, which has lagged in e-commerce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Online retail spending in eight of Europe’s largest economies, including those of France, Germany and Britain, is expected to total about $189 billion this year, compared with $306 billion in the United States, according to the Center for Retail Research, a British consulting group.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The United States, whose population is about the same as the combined population of the eight European countries surveyed, has a higher percentage of shoppers online and those shoppers each spend several hundred dollars more a year than do online consumers in Europe, the research group said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Countries like Germany and Britain are among Amazon’s largest markets outside of the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts say Amazon might be able to attract customers in Germany and Britain to its smartphone by allowing them to linking the device with other offerings like its fast-shipping services, which have proved successful in those markets.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As part of its American rollout, Amazon will offer a free one-year membership to its Amazon Prime service, which includes free shipping and online video streaming. The Fire phone sells for $199 with a two-year AT&amp;T contract.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Amazon will have to convince its Prime users in Europe to use its smartphone,’’ said Roberta Cozza of the technology research company Gartner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But for the Fire phone to take hold beyond these European countries, Amazon will have to get consumers in other parts of the region to not only buy the device but also to spend more money online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘We are further behind the U.S. in embracing e-commerce,’’ said Joshua Bamfield, director of the Center for Retail Research.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has announced a device that tries to fulfill the retailer’s dream of being integrated into consumers’ lives at every possible waking moment — whether they are deciding where to eat, realizing they need more toilet paper or intrigued by a snatch of overheard music.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The device is a cellphone, but making calls on it got almost no attention at all at the event in Seattle where it was introduced on Wednesday. The Fire phone, the product of four years of research and development, offers Amazon fans the chance to live in an Amazon-themed world, where just about every element can be identified, listed, ranked, shared and, of course, ordered.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It offered a view of a mobile future that will be alluring to some but might repel others. If the device works as described, and Amazon entices even a small portion of its 250 million active customers to buy one, the Fire could accelerate Amazon’s already intense competition with other retailers and tech companies, not to mention intensifying some of its current battles with suppliers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As if to underline the no-gloves nature of the battle, a promotional video in the first few moments of the presentation took a direct slap at Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire’s product recognition feature, Firefly, ‘‘is potentially a real threat to bricks and mortar retailers,’’ said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. ‘‘Scan a product or listen to music, and you’re delivered straight to the page on Amazon on which you can purchase it. Impulse shopping just went to a new level.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s phone — consumers in the United States can order it now; it ships starting July 25 — is arriving as the leading technology companies are increasingly trying to develop an array of services and products to keep consumers from wandering, the digital equivalent of Disney’s not wanting you to leave Disneyland for lunch.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microsoft brought out a tablet; Facebook tried a phone; Google is experimenting with a shopping and delivery service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Against such a frenzy of competition and innovation, an Amazon phone was inevitable. The company’s leaders asked themselves only one question, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, told the crowd at the event: ‘‘Can we build a better phone for our most engaged customers?’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos promoted Firefly heavily, as well as something Amazon calls Dynamic Perspective. Cameras on the phone allow the user to gain another view of a video game or see layered information on a map, like a Yelp review. Whether Dynamic Perspective is a gimmick or something more will depend on how aggressively developers invent new apps for it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This is the next big battleground in the ecosystem war,’’ said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie. ‘‘Amazon is not going to turn the tide decisively in its favor with this, but just needs to establish a beachhead.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s leap into the smartphone business comes as sales of the devices are beginning to mature, at least in the United States and Europe. Their use for shopping, however, is just beginning to explode. In the United States, purchases made with phones will jump more than 25 percent this year, to over $18 billion, according to eMarketer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos, for all his zeal, was relatively circumspect about the phone’s ultimate implications. Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of AT&amp;T Mobility, Amazon’s carrier partner, was more direct during a brief appearance on stage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I am going to buy a whole lot more things with this technology than I ever have before,’’ Mr. de la Vega said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One interesting question will be whether the phone will allow apps that might take customers to retailers whose prices undercut Amazon. Will residents of Planet Amazon, in other words, be permitted to visit other shopping worlds?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Our idea is to give the lowest price to the customer,’’ Dave Limp, an Amazon executive, said in an interview. ‘‘If we don’t have it, shame on us.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The lengthy development process for the Amazon phone was partly a result of the difficulty of the task. Phones are a graveyard of tech dreams. Just ask Google, which was hailed as a genius for buying the handset maker Motorola, and then hailed again for cutting its losses and promptly selling the faded icon. Only Apple and Samsung have found making phones consistently profitable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon, as always, is operating with a different playbook.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Amazon introduced the Kindle Fire in 2011, there was a lot of chatter about its being a challenge to Apple’s iPad. It was not. In the first quarter of this year, Apple had about a third of the tablet market, according to the research firm the International Data Corporation. Amazon had less than 2 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, that is a million more consumers taking up residence in the Amazon ecosystem. Just about anyone who has a Kindle Fire is a candidate for membership in Amazon’s fast-shipping club, Amazon Prime, and just about any Prime member might be enticed to buy a Kindle. Amazon Prime has an estimated 20 million subscribers, at $99 a year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Phone costs $199 with a two-year contract with AT&amp;T. But Amazon, as expected, is adding a year of free Prime club membership.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘If they are able to capture 10 percent of those Prime subscribers in the near term, then that would likely constitute a success,’’ said Eugene Signorini, vice president for mobile insights at Mobiquity. That would force Google and Apple, and possibly Facebook and Microsoft, to introduce innovations and new features in their own products. Mr. Schachter of Macquarie said that would benefit consumers in the short term.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">And in the long term, if Amazon or one of the other companies becomes dominant to the exclusion of all others? ‘‘That might be more problematic,’’ Mr. Schachter said.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140619ea6k00039</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_006.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark6">B</a><a name="bookmark7">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">AMAZON&#39;S CHIEF SETS PHONE GOALS</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By FARHAD MANJOO</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">33 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">20 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shortly after he introduced the new Fire phone on Wednesday, I spoke with Jeff Bezos, Amazon&#39;s founder and chief executive, about the device and Amazon&#39;s goals in the smartphone business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here is an edited transcript of the conversation. Sadly, it does not do justice to Mr. Bezos&#39;s booming laugh, which punctuated many of his sentences.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why did you make a phone?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our product development process always starts the same way. We don&#39;t start out by saying, &#39;&#39;We have to build an X.&#39;&#39; We say, &#39;&#39;If we were going to build an X, how would it be different? How would it be better?&#39;&#39; And it can&#39;t just be different. It has to be different constrained by customers caring. It&#39;s easy to be different if you don&#39;t constrain it that way. But it has to be useful.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">But are you too late into this market? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I think in the whole evolution of this, we&#39;re still pretty early. I don&#39;t want to judge before all the facts are in, but I think this wireless thing is going to be big.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If we go back in time just five, six, seven years, we&#39;re talking about different players -- Nokia, BlackBerry and others. Things change very rapidly in this area.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I was surprised that you weren&#39;t competing on price so aggressively. This is essentially the same price as rival devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, it&#39;s 32 gigabytes instead of 16, which is a big deal. So don&#39;t forget that small fact! And it has Prime -- for new or existing members, you get 12 months free.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">But it&#39;s a really premium phone. We&#39;ve packed a lot of hardware, a lot of expensive materials into the phone. Q.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Are you saying you&#39;re not making a profit on the phone? When you launched the Kindle tablets, you said you didn&#39;t want to make money when people buy your devices -- you want to make money when people use your devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m saying we haven&#39;t changed our approach. We look at it holistically.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I still see people using second-generation Kindles, like if I go to the beach. Gosh, that&#39;s a six-year-old Kindle. And we don&#39;t have to feel bad about that. We don&#39;t have to wish they were on the upgrade treadmill. I like the alignment with the customer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">With the $199 phone -- that&#39;s the same approach. Q.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">The other thing that&#39;s clear about the device is that it hooks you into buying from Amazon very directly. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We make those actions very simple. As we should. Guess what: One of the things people want to do with their phones is buy stuff, from Amazon and in general. So helping people take care of their shopping tasks is an important job to do in any smartphone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But that&#39;s not what the phone is about. It has to stand on its own as a fantastic phone. It even has to make phone calls.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And most exciting for us is third-party developers. It&#39;s easy to add custom actions to Firefly [the Fire&#39;s image-recognition system], and it&#39;s going to be really interesting to see what they come up with.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It sounds like you&#39;ve been using the Fire phone as your own phone. What were you using before, and what&#39;s it been like to use this?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, Samsung. And the thing I&#39;ve noticed is when I switch back to another phone, I&#39;m still reaching for the gestures that work so reliably on Fire phone, like autoscroll.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the design team, invention is about stepping back and finding those things in technology that aren&#39;t ideal, but you&#39;re so inured to them that you don&#39;t realize they could probably be improved. Traditionally scrolling is not that good. It&#39;s often a two-handed gesture. You&#39;re interjecting your finger in front of the screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Once you get used to autoscrolling, you&#39;ll be trying to do it on another device -- and that&#39;s a good sign. Q.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">How will you know whether this phone is working? What are your benchmarks? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have a long history of getting started and being patient. There are lot of assets you have to bring to bear to be able to offer a phone like this. The huge content ecosystem is one of them. The reputation for customer support is one of them. We have a lot of those pieces in place.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: justify;">It&#39;s our job to keep inventing and to be patient. One thing leads to the next. Q.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Is it too simplistic to point to one number -- to say the phone is aimed at selling Prime memberships, say? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yes, that is too simplistic. If you looked at the ratio of hard work in this to selling Prime memberships, that would be the hardest thing we could do. If you just looked at the number of machine vision and computer scientists, hardware engineers, you&#39;re talking about thousands of people building this phone.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, all of these things are self-reinforcing. The phone will make Prime memberships better, and Prime looks great on this phone. It&#39;s not that there&#39;s no interaction between these elements. But to say that&#39;s the primary purpose is too simplistic.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">You showed a graph of Prime memberships rising sharply. Is that because of your media content? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I think so. It&#39;s always hard to know for sure. But when we started Prime Instant Video, we started with 5,000 videos. People loved it. They didn&#39;t say, &#39;&#39;It&#39;s terrible, it&#39;s just 5,000 videos.&#39;&#39; They said, &#39;&#39;I bought this for fast, unlimited shipping, and I just got this really cool thing at no additional charge.&#39;&#39; And now it&#39;s 40,000 videos, including much-sought-after exclusives.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We can track people who are joining Prime for the first time, and we know if they&#39;re coming from a page about free shipping or a page about Prime Instant Video.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With every passing year, that is shifting toward Prime Instant Videos. There&#39;s one group of customers who start their membership because of Prime Instant Video, but they&#39;re like, &#39;&#39;I got this free two-day shipping thing.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There&#39;s this other group that starts with free shipping. That&#39;s still the bigger group, and they&#39;re like, &#39;&#39;I can get this cool video.&#39;&#39; All these things work together.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos, Amazon&#39;s chief, introducing the Fire, the online retailer&#39;s new smartphone venture, in Seattle on Wednesday.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Amazon invited the media and hundreds of its most loyal customers to witness the unveiling of a new device on Wednesday, everyone thought the company would introduce a smartphone made in the mold of its line of tablet computers: pretty good and really cheap.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Everyone was wrong. Though the device is called the Fire phone, Amazon’s new gadget is less a phone than a pocketable cash register hooked directly into the retailer’s intelligent warehouses. And it’s not cheap. The Fire phone sells for $199 with a two-year AT&amp;T contract. Although it also comes with a free one-year subscription to Amazon’s Prime membership, the Fire phone is essentially the same price as high-end phones made by Apple and Samsung.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Amazon, a company whose previous devices have had innovative pricing plans that often involved selling devices at cost, the Fire phone’s uninspired price tag is a surprising disappointment. The world needed a great, cheap smartphone. With its huge reach, obsessive dedication to customer service and a willingness to forgo immediate profits, Amazon seems uniquely capable of delivering such a device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But instead of a cheap phone, Amazon delivered a device packed with many high-end, whiz-bang features. Some of those features may be attractive to people who already love Amazon, but for people who aren’t looking to be hooked so intimately into Amazon’s brain, it’s hard to see what this phone offers over the iPhone, the Samsung Galaxy or any other top-of-the-line smartphone on the market today.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It’s a really premium phone,’’ said Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, when asked during an interview about the phone’s price. ‘‘We’ve packed a lot of hardware and expensive material in.’’ Mr. Bezos declined to say whether the company would make a profit on each phone sold. In the past, the company has eschewed that model of hardware sales. But he said the Fire phone’s technological capabilities made it a bargain at its price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s true that the Fire phone has several novel features. Among them is an image-recognition system, Firefly, that will let you identify any book, movie, phone number or other object you point at your phone. Firefly is the heart of the phone’s connection to Amazon’s shopping engine. Aim the device at anything around your house, like a bag of cat litter or a tube of toothpaste, and the phone instantly recognizes it and gives you an option to buy the item and have it delivered immediately. During a short demonstration of the phone, which is available for order now and will ship on July 25, I found that feature to be eerily accurate. It flawlessly recognized pretty much everything I pointed to, offering me a way to buy something on the fly — from Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos pushed back against the idea that there was anything nefarious about this connection to Amazon’s store. ‘‘Helping people take care of their shopping tasks is an important job to do in any smartphone,’’ he said. ‘‘But that’s not what the phone is all about.’’ He added that it would be ‘‘too simplistic’’ to call the phone simply a vehicle for selling Prime memberships, though he conceded that Prime members would get a lot out of this device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire has an innovative 3-D display that adds a sense of perspective to some of its user-interface screens. The system also allows you to scroll or browse through content by tilting the phone in certain ways. That feature leans more toward the gimmicky than the useful, but not in an annoying way. It does not slow down or otherwise interrupt how you use the device, but I’m not sure that it will add much, either. On the other hand, it does look pretty cool.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has included two features that are unusual and useful. One is Mayday, Amazon’s live video customer service, which it began offering on its Kindle Fire tablets last year. The feature lets you call up an instant,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">on-screen video chat with a customer service representative at the push of a button.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even the best, easiest-to-use smartphones can sometimes be vexing. How do you connect your phone to both your work and personal calendar? How do you get on your company’s VPN?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What’s the best way to send your mother a dozen full-resolution photos? Answering such questions for other phones involves consulting confusing online instructions, calling an 800 number or driving to a store. With Mayday, you just beckon for help; it’s immediate and delightful.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The other fantastic Fire phone feature: Every photo you snap on the phone is backed up on Amazon’s servers free. There’s no limit to how many photos are stored there. It’s a simple, headache-free backup system that I wish every other phone manufacturer offered — Apple most urgently.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And yet, despite these distinctions, Amazon’s phone suffers severe shortcomings compared with similarly priced rivals. Its app store doesn’t have anywhere near the number of third-party programs currently available on the iPhone or Android devices. There are more than 200,000 apps in Amazon’s store, but almost all are designed for the firm’s tablets. IOS and Android have app stores approaching a million titles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because Amazon’s phone is based on a version of Google’s Android operating system, it could be pretty simple for developers to transform some of their Android phone apps into Amazon phone apps, but it’s impossible to predict how many will do that.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With a cheaper phone marketed at a broader audience, Amazon could have jump-started that process. But a phone whose primary audience consists of Amazon Prime members may not be that attractive to developers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">More challenging than the app shortage is the phone’s novel user interface. While the Fire phone does look simple, it’s thoroughly new. People who are used to iOS and Android will need to figure out new ways to get around this device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It didn’t have to be this way. Amazon’s phone is making its debut at a pivotal time in the business — when innovation in high-end smartphones seems to have plateaued, with each new top phone just incrementally better than the last.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If expensive phones are now considered boring, customers might well begin to wonder if they need to spend all that much. Amazon could have offered a groundbreaking alternative — a great phone without whiz-bang features, for a substantial discount.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How much cheaper? Consider this math. Amazon’s $200-with-contract price implies a full sales price of about</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$650. You don’t see that price when you sign up for service, but it will be built into your monthly bill. For instance, if you get a 1 GB plan from AT&amp;T with the new phone, you will pay $82 a month — $50 a month for data service, plus an additional $32 a month for the Fire phone. The iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy sell for the same price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Amazon hadn’t added many of the more far-out features in the phone, it might have been able to make the phone for $250. If it sold its device at that price, then, your monthly bill would be $62.50 instead — $50 for data, plus only $12.50 for the phone. That might have been truly groundbreaking.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although he did not show the feature onstage, Mr. Bezos confirmed that his expensive new phone does makes calls. ‘‘I haven’t made a phone call on my phone in a long time,’’ he said. ‘‘But I know people still make phone calls.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document INHT000020140619ea6k0003q</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_009.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark12">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</a><a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">As Amazon and Hachette Brawl, Other Booksellers Are Preparing to Cash In</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By LESLIE KAUFMAN and ELIZABETH A. HARRIS</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">792 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 6</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like any mystery novel expected to be a summer blockbuster, Robert Galbraith&#39;s &#39;&#39;The Silkworm,&#39;&#39; set for release on Thursday, features shadowy subtext and crafty machinations -- but in this book&#39;s case the maneuverings are both on and off the page.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s because Mr. Galbraith is not a run-of-the-mill thriller writer but the pseudonym for J. K. Rowling, creator of the Harry Potter series, and the publisher is Little, Brown and Company, a division of Hachette Book Group, which is locked in battle with Amazon, the giant online retailer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which controls roughly a third of the United States book market, has been discouraging sales of Hachette books in an effort to make the publisher agree to terms on a new contract for its e-books. As part of the standoff, Amazon has removed pre-order buttons for several Hachette titles, including &#39;&#39;The Silkworm.&#39;&#39; While Amazon&#39;s hardball tactics have been a nightmare for Hachette and its affected authors, other booksellers have smelled opportunity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; expected to be a big hit -- the first Galbraith book, &#39;&#39;The Cuckoo&#39;s Calling,&#39;&#39; was a No. 1 New York Times bestseller -- retailers from independent bookstores to giant box chains are looking to exploit the dispute to win back customers who may be frustrated by Amazon&#39;s lack of inventory. (An Amazon spokeswoman said it will begin selling &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; on Thursday, though it is unclear whether it will have it in stock or there will be shipping delays, as there have been with other Hachette books.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart, especially, is looking to capitalize. In the last few weeks, the retailer has augmented its promotional strategy to give &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; an additional boost. This week, Walmart-sponsored advertisements started appearing on Facebook, promoting heavily discounted books -- most visibly &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; -- at Walmart. And a few weeks ago, the company sent an email to millions of customers promoting certain Hachette titles. It also displayed those books on its home page, and &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; was featured.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We just want to continue to let customers and readers know that they can find &#39;Silkworm&#39; and other Hachette titles at Walmart,&#39;&#39; said Jaeme Laczkowski, a Walmart spokeswoman.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the other end of the bookselling spectrum, Third Place Books in Seattle has been giving 20 percent off the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$28 list price to customers who pre-order the book from them and has promised to hand-deliver on Thursday. Other major booksellers are also eagerly awaiting the arrival of &#39;&#39;The Silkworm.&#39;&#39; At Books-A-Million, for example, some Hachette titles are available for up to 40 percent off, and &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; will be featured prominently at the front of the store for a discount of up to 30 percent. This week, the home page of the iTunes book section has featured a list of e-books available for pre-order for an unusually low price of $9.99 or less, all of which are Hachette titles, including &#39;&#39;The Silkworm.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hudson Booksellers, the ubiquitous airport bookstore, has created a Hachette page on its website that includes titles for 30 and 40 percent off -- along with a red downloadable sticker that reads &#39;&#39;I Didn&#39;t Buy it on Amazon.&#39;&#39; That sticker was first shown on Stephen Colbert&#39;s show earlier this month, and is also available for download on his website.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Mr. Colbert is a Hachette author.)</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble has not adjusted its marketing plan for &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; over the last few weeks -- its executives said they had always planned to give it a full-throated promotional push. Its efforts appear to be paying off. On Thursday, the book was ranked No. 1 among hardcover titles on the company&#39;s website.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We&#39;ve partnered with Hachette and supported J. K. Rowling from the very beginning,&#39;&#39; Mary Amicucci, vice president of adult trade books at Barnes &amp; Noble, said in an email. &#39;&#39;We know &#39;Silkworm&#39; is going to be one of our biggest books of the summer and have put forth our full marketing assets.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, Little, Brown, the publisher of &#39;&#39;The Silkworm,&#39;&#39; had ambitious marketing plans in place before the fight with Amazon broke out. Heather Fain, a marketing executive at Little, Brown, noted that while the inability to pre-order from Amazon could have hurt the book&#39;s sales, it also received a big publicity boost from all the attention it has received because of the dispute.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">J. K. Rowling&#39;s new book &#39;&#39;The Silkworm,&#39;&#39; to be released on Thursday, is expected to be a top seller. Walmart and other booksellers are racing to promote it, even at a discount.

Apple reached not just the “gadgetheads,” but the style obsessives as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of Steve Jobs’s great insights was that technology could take a page from high-fashion strategy in terms of tapping into desire and utilizing seasonal planned obsolescence in order to sell more stuff. Lots more stuff.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No other smartphone maker has been able to push those buttons as effectively, and get consumers to identify with their products the way, say, they identify with their handbags. So what are Amazon’s chances?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I’d say so-so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From what I can see, the phone looks good. I quite like the all-black casing and screen (black being very fashion), which makes the visuals pop. The problem is Amazon’s own image as the superstore for everything, not an exclusive, discriminating emporium. Its draw for consumers (for yours truly, if I am being honest) has always been ease and access: You can find anything if you are willing to weed through page after page of options. Yippee!</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But it just doesn’t make its choices feel special. And the promise of feeling special is what draws consumers to fashion.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/2012/05/07/amazon-embraces-highest-end-fashion/" class="s1" target="_blank">This is why Amazon — despite lots of talk about opportunity in high-end fashion and the fact that Jeff Bezos actually stood next to fashion’s grand pooh-bah Anna Wintour in black tie as </a><a href="http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/2012/05/07/amazon-embraces-highest-end-fashion/" class="a" target="_blank">a sponsor of the Met Ball</a> <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/498c7136-0f17-11e2-9895-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3551UK2uC" class="s1" target="_blank">in 2012 — has always been viewed with skepticism by members of the premium fashion industry. </a><a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/498c7136-0f17-11e2-9895-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3551UK2uC" class="a" target="_blank">They are not convinced</a> <span style=" color: #000;">it is the “right environment” for their products.

Sadly, it does not do justice to Mr. Bezos’s booming laugh, which punctuated many of his sentences.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why did you make a phone?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our product development process always starts the same way. We don’t start out by saying, “We have to build an X.” We say, “If we were going to build an X, how would it be different? How would it be better?” And it can’t just be different. It has to be different constrained by customers caring. It’s easy to be different if you don’t constrain it that way. But it has to be useful.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">But are you too late into this market? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I think in the whole evolution of this, we’re still pretty early. I don’t want to judge before all the facts are in, but I think this wireless thing is going to be big.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If we go back in time just five, six, seven years, we’re talking about different players — Nokia, BlackBerry and others. Things change very rapidly in this area.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I was surprised that you weren’t competing on price so aggressively. This is essentially the same price as rival devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, it’s 32 gigabytes instead of 16, which is a big deal. So don’t forget that small fact! And it has Prime — for new or existing members, you get 12 months free.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">But it’s a really premium phone. We’ve packed a lot of hardware, a lot of expensive materials into the phone. Q.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Are you saying you’re not making a profit on the phone? When you launched the Kindle tablets, you said you didn’t want to make money when people buy your devices — you want to make money when people use your devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I’m saying we haven’t changed our approach. We look at it holistically.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I still see people using second-generation Kindles, like if I go to the beach. Gosh, that’s a six-year-old Kindle. And we don’t have to feel bad about that. We don’t have to wish they were on the upgrade treadmill. I like the alignment with the customer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">With the $199 phone — that’s the same approach. Q.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">The other thing that’s clear about the device is that it hooks you into buying from Amazon very directly. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We make those actions very simple. As we should. Guess what: One of the things people want to do with their phones is buy stuff, from Amazon and in general. So helping people take care of their shopping tasks is an important job to do in any smartphone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But that’s not what the phone is about. It has to stand on its own as a fantastic phone. It even has to make phone calls.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And most exciting for us is third-party developers. It’s easy to add custom actions to Firefly [the Fire&#39;s image-recognition system], and it’s going to be really interesting to see what they come up with.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It sounds like you’ve been using the Fire phone as your own phone. What were you using before, and what’s it been like to use this?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, Samsung. And the thing I’ve noticed is when I switch back to another phone, I’m still reaching for the gestures that work so reliably on Fire phone, like autoscroll.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For the design team, invention is about stepping back and finding those things in technology that aren’t ideal, but you’re so inured to them that you don’t realize they could probably be improved. Traditionally scrolling is not that good. It’s often a two-handed gesture. You’re interjecting your finger in front of the screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: justify;">Once you get used to autoscrolling, you’ll be trying to do it on another device — and that’s a good sign. Q.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">How will you know whether this phone is working? What are your benchmarks? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have a long history of getting started and being patient. There are lot of assets you have to bring to bear to be able to offer a phone like this. The huge content ecosystem is one of them. The reputation for customer support is one of them. We have a lot of those pieces in place.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: justify;">It’s our job to keep inventing and to be patient. One thing leads to the next. Q.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Is it too simplistic to point to one number — to say the phone is aimed at selling Prime memberships, say? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yes, that is too simplistic. If you looked at the ratio of hard work in this to selling Prime memberships, that would be the hardest thing we could do. If you just looked at the number of machine vision and computer scientists, hardware engineers, you’re talking about thousands of people building this phone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, all of these things are self-reinforcing. The phone will make Prime memberships better, and Prime looks great on this phone. It’s not that there’s no interaction between these elements. But to say that’s the primary purpose is too simplistic.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">You showed a graph of Prime memberships rising sharply. Is that because of your media content? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I think so. It’s always hard to know for sure. But when we started Prime Instant Video, we started with 5,000 videos. People loved it. They didn’t say, “It’s terrible, it’s just 5,000 videos.” They said, “I bought this for fast, unlimited shipping, and I just got this really cool thing at no additional charge.” And now it’s 40,000 videos, including much-sought-after exclusives.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We can track people who are joining Prime for the first time, and we know if they’re coming from a page about free shipping or a page about Prime Instant Video.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With every passing year, that is shifting toward Prime Instant Videos. There’s one group of customers who start their membership because of Prime Instant Video, but they’re like, “I got this free two-day shipping thing.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There’s this other group that starts with free shipping. That’s still the bigger group, and they’re like, “I can get this cool video.” All these things work together.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140619ea6j00232</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_014.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark22">B</a><a name="bookmark23">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">MISSED OPPORTUNITIES AS AMAZON IS AIMING FOR THE STARS</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By FARHAD MANJOO</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">75 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

Though the device is called the Fire phone, Amazon’s new gadget is less a phone than a pocketable cash register hooked directly into the retailer’s intelligent warehouses. And it’s not cheap. The Fire phone sells for $199 with a two-year AT&amp;T contract. Although it also comes with a free one-year subscription to Amazon’s Prime membership, the Fire phone is essentially the same price as high-end phones made by Apple and Samsung.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Amazon, a company whose previous devices have had innovative pricing plans that often involved selling devices at cost, the Fire phone’s uninspired price tag is a surprising disappointment. The world needed a great, cheap smartphone. With its huge reach, obsessive dedication to customer service, and a willingness to forgo immediate profits, Amazon seems uniquely capable of delivering such a device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But instead of a cheap phone, Amazon delivered a device packed with many high-end, whiz-bang features. Some of those features may be attractive to people who already love Amazon, but for people who aren’t looking to be hooked so intimately into Amazon’s brain, it’s hard to see what this phone offers over the iPhone, the Samsung Galaxy or any other top-of-the-line smartphone on the market today.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140619ea6j001gt</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_017.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark28">Tech Demographics The Upshot</a><a name="bookmark29">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">How Amazon Measures Phone Success</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">475 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19 June 2014 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014.

They shop on Amazon more often, and spend significantly more money than other Amazon shoppers – an average $58 per transaction, versus $41 for non-Prime members, according to comScore. Prime shoppers account for half of Amazon’s sales, comScore estimates.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s ultimate goal, of course, is to sell stuff: books and clothes and diapers and movies and songs. And people are increasingly shopping on their phones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consumers spent $7.3 billion on mobile devices in the first quarter of the year, which is just 11.5 percent of the amount they spent on e-commerce as a whole. But mobile spending is growing at double the rate of shopping on computers. In the last year, the number of people who shop on Amazon only on their phones has grown 32 percent, comScore said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And perhaps most important for retailers and advertisers, 78 percent of shopping searches on mobile phones result in a purchase – significantly more than on desktop computers or tablets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Amazon phone’s Firefly feature recognizes things to buy and makes it easy to buy them from Amazon. Success for Amazon will not necessarily be overtaking iPhones or Samsung phones, but wringing more money from its most loyal shoppers, on whatever device they want to shop.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It’s not like it’s an attempt to overthrow Apple and Google and Samsung,” said Benedict Evans, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, who writes a popular newsletter about the mobile industry. “It’s locking in the top 10 percent most valuable customers more and more and more. They want to be the Sears Roebuck catalog of the Internet, and everything they do is around reinforcing that relationship.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s new phone has loads of features: the ability to recognize thousands of products in stores, supposedly tangle-free earbud cords and a screen that gives images the illusion of depth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Impressive, but the price for the Fire is $200, which doesn’t seem very special. Apple, Samsung and others, after all, have phones for that price. Even if you consider that the price is really $100 because Amazon will give you a year of $99 Prime service — free delivery and free videos and streaming music — is it enough to switch?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since almost all people who might consider an Amazon phone have a smartphone already, many of them with apps that do the things that a Fire does, the cost of getting the Amazon Fire isn’t $100. It is instead what economists call switching costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The friction isn’t a Benjamin in your wallet but the agony — or the belief there will be agony — of learning how to use it, of finding new apps, of loading those apps, of never again using a favorite app, of moving your contact list over, of losing all the text messages you sent, or of worrying that the movies and music you had on one system won’t work on the other.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How do you value that? It’s easier to sit where you are.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why would you switch? When the existing technology you have falls behind. It happened to users of Palm phones, once as innovative as Apple or Amazon are. Millions of people have left their BlackBerrys behind, even though they loved the keyboard and messaging abilities, because it lacked so much else.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So all Apple, Samsung or Google, maker of Android software, needs to do is match Amazon’s best features, which makes shopping (on Amazon) a breeze.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And that may be precisely what Amazon wants.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

Chen, BlackBerry’s chairman and chief executive, has repeatedly acknowledged that an absence of popular apps has hampered the company’s BlackBerry 10 line of phones. Candy Crush Saga players, Netflix viewers and Pinterest shoppers were among those who were out of luck if they bought a BlackBerry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BlackBerry announced last year with much fanfare that the BlackBerry 10 phones would be able to use apps developed for Android, the Google mobile operating system, which Amazon has adopted for its phone. But apparently out of security and compatibility concerns, BlackBerry did not make installing Android apps straightforward, particularly at first. The company instead preferred that developers submit their Android apps for distribution through BlackBerry’s app store.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/how-to/the-easiest-way-to-install-android-apps-on-bb10/" class="s1" target="_blank">An upgrade of the BlackBerry operating system released in January eventually allowed users to download apps from Amazon’s app store </a>through a process that was somewhat easier, if not entirely obvious<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new relationship with Amazon will make Amazon’s store directly available on BlackBerry phones after another operating system upgrade, which is scheduled for this fall. BlackBerry will also help developers who have posted apps on its store to also include them on Amazon’s. It was not immediately apparent if BlackBerry had found a way to deal with apps on Amazon’s store that are not fully compatible with its phones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lisette Kwong, a spokeswoman for BlackBerry, said that the company would continue to maintain its own app store after formally opening up its phones to Amazon. Asked why BlackBerry had not opened its phones to Google’s app store as well, Ms. Kwong replied: “We explored, and continue to explore, various options to improve the services and user experience for our customers. This opportunity with the Amazon Appstore is the best opportunity we have for delivering a greater selection of apps for our users.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maynard Um, an analyst with Wells Fargo, suggested in a note to investors that the Amazon relationship was unlikely to reverse BlackBerry’s slide.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Broadly speaking, the announcement should be viewed positive, in our view, though, whether it stems consumer churn remains to be seen,” Mr. Um wrote.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140618ea6i002e6</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_020.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark34">finance</a><a name="bookmark35">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon wants a direct line to customers; Retailer’s smartphone would be a big gamble in a highly competitive field</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">900 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">17 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">17</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

Amazon wants to burrow even deeper into our lives.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company is expected to introduce a smartphone on Wednesday at an event in Seattle, a long-rumored project that aims to close any remaining gap between the impulse to buy and the real act.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has spent the last several years investing billions of dollars on multiple fronts: constructing warehouses all over the United States to deliver goods as fast as possible, building devices as varied as tablets and set-top boxes, and creating and licensing entertainment to stock those devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It adds up to an ambitious venture without precedent in modern merchandising. Wall Street has cheered, but competitors like Walmart, eBay, Apple and Google have regarded these activities with unease. Customers are propelling Amazon toward the rare ranks of companies with revenue of $100 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The phone is the last and most crucial link in this colossal enterprise. It is a singular gamble for a company that, for all its technology components, is still primarily a merchant. Because even the smartest technology companies have trouble with phones. A Google smartphone, the Nexus One, failed to catch on. Google next bought Motorola and then dumped it. BlackBerry, once the dominant smartphone maker, is struggling to survive. Microsoft’s Windows Phone has less than 3 percent of the global market. A Facebook phone stumbled last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When it comes to smartphone profits, Apple and Samsung divide them up, leaving crumbs for other companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Mobile is asserting not just its utility but its supremacy,’’ said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. ‘‘If you’re Amazon, you’re worried you’re going to be cut out of the next big interface. So you jump in and make yourself relevant, whether your customer is in the bathroom, the kitchen or the car. You go for broke.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Amazon, the risk of doing nothing is that it could be completely marginalized by one of its competitors. Mr. McQuivey offered the example of coconut flour. Search for the flour on Google, and Amazon comes up in two of the top responses, one of them an ad it paid for. In the future as designed by Google, however, the search engine will remember what you are looking for when you’re out in the world and sell ads against that. So the next time you pass Trader Joe’s, your Android phone sends a note: There is coconut flour just 50 feet away.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If that sort of transaction starts happening too often, the coconut flour is going to go stale in Amazon’s warehouses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In building a phone, Amazon has advantages other phone makers do not. It can sell to its 250 million customers without a middleman. It can bundle features with the Amazon Prime membership club, as it just did last week with a new streaming music service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most of all, Amazon has the blessing of Wall Street to lose money as long as it is gaining market share — though recently the enthusiasm has dimmed a bit. The stock is about 20 percent off its peak.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An early demonstration of what Amazon wants to do with shopping can be seen in the Dash, a wand that the company quietly introduced this year. Customers who belong to Amazon’s grocery service can use the Dash, which scans bar codes and takes voice commands, to restock their refrigerator and cabinets.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Imagine the Dash set free on the world and you have Amazon’s long-term hopes for a phone. Sam Hall, an Amazon mobile executive, set forth the agenda in an interview a few years ago: ‘‘We’re trying to remove the barrier between ‘I want that’ and ‘I have it.’’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on the event Wednesday. Reporters and the public were invited to apply to attend the event, and so were developers who had worked on apps using a phone’s motion sensors. The developers were also asked if they had experience with ‘‘machine learning,’’ which could mean Amazon is trying to design the phone so it can serve information based on behavior. For instance, say you bought a new camera on Amazon, searched for hotels in Florence, Italy, and downloaded a timetable for Italian trains; the company could ask you, Would you like to buy this passport holder? Special price, today only.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon at the moment is publicly fighting with several media suppliers, including Hachette and Warner Home Video in the United States and Bonnier in Germany. It wants better terms, as it nearly always does, and the media companies are resisting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ironically, for all the criticism that Amazon’s book business has generated recently, the company kicked off its event with an old-fashioned — in all senses of the word — book. On Friday, attendees received a 1965 children’s tale, ‘‘Mr. Pine’s Purple House,’’ in the mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s about a man who wants to distinguish his house from the other houses on the street, so he paints it purple. Accompanying the book was a note from Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, saying that this was his favorite childhood book. ‘‘I think you’ll agree that the world is a better place when things are a little bit different,’’ Mr. Bezos wrote.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140616ea6h0002z</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_021.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark36">B</a><a name="bookmark37">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">WITH PHONE, AMAZON SEEKS TETHER TO SHOPPERS</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">67 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon introduced a music streaming feature on Thursday that gives subscribers to its Prime service access to thousands of songs free and without interruptions from advertising.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new feature, called Prime Music, which has been rumored in the music industry for months, has music from two of the three major record labels as well as various independents. But it omits most new releases and will not include the catalog of the Universal Music Group, the world’s largest music company, as a result of strained negotiations over licensing terms.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, already one of the biggest retailers of music downloads, is adding the streaming feature as a sweetener for its Prime customers, whose annual subscription fee was recently raised to $99 from $79. Prime subscribers get free two-day shipping on orders, and other perks like free streaming for some movies and television shows.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Licensing negotiations with record labels and music publishers began about six months ago, but they were slowed by disagreements over financial terms that many music companies considered low.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon told most small labels that in exchange for one-year licensing agreements they would be offered shares of a $5 million royalty pool, to be divided by a market-share formula of Amazon’s choosing, according to two people involved in the negotiations who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal. Bigger labels and distributors were offered larger one-time payments for a year of access to certain titles. Amazon initially offered a total of about $25 million in these fees; it was unclear whether the figure changed in negotiations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sony and Warner Music, two of the three major labels, have signed such deals. But Universal, whose catalog includes stars like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Kanye West, did not reach an agreement with Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With a relatively small catalog, Amazon’s service is not seen as a major threat to companies like Spotify, Rhapsody and Beats Music, which offer millions of songs. But Amazon’s sheer size gives it a big advantage. The company recently announced that it had 244 million active customer accounts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140612ea6d000dz</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_024.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark42">finance</a><a name="bookmark43">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Early adopters see major flaws as field develops; Special Report: Bits</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">763 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">202</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. The C.I.A. isn’t afraid of the cloud.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, a relative baby in the field of technology services, triumphed over stalwart IBM to gain a $600 million Central Intelligence Agency contract, but the most remarkable part of the deal was that the agency was a cloud convert in the first place. The fact that a tech company could warehouse data involving the government’s spies is the clearest signal yet that cloud computing is having its moment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Somewhat like outsourcing a decade ago, cloud computing is the coming technology destined to sweep away all before it. Amazon Web Services is the fastest-growing part of fast-growing Amazon, and analysts expect it someday to be the dominant part of the company. Google, IBM, Verizon, Microsoft and a host of smaller players are competing for a part of the action. Global spending on public cloud services alone is forecast to hit $210 billion in 2016, up 172 percent from 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And yet outsourcing provides a cautionary tale of how enthusiasm can be derailed by reality. Outsourcing advocates said every customer service call, every information technology fix, even the creation of routine legal documents was destined to be done in India or the Philippines. They said this would be cheaper and more efficient. They said American companies would be hollowed out.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It didn’t happen quite that way. While many companies outsourced routine tasks, some moved them back after complaints of poor service. Others never outsourced. Outsourcing was ultimately a segment of the market rather than becoming the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloud computing is already confronting similar issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Members of the Open Data Center Alliance, a consortium of global information technology companies like Infosys, Disney, Deutsche Telekom and SAP, are cloud enthusiasts. But in a recent alliance survey, two-thirds of the members said concerns about data security were delaying their move to the cloud. That was down from the 80 percent of respondents who expressed a concern about security the previous year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other results, however, are headed away from cloud computing. Fifty-six percent now say regulatory issues will limit their adoption, up from 47 percent. And 47 percent worry about being tied to one vendor, up from 39 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloud computing ‘‘is kind of in the first wave,’’ said Michael Masterson, director of cloud solutions for Compuware, which helps clients improve the performance of their applications. ‘‘I don’t know if I’d call it immature, but it’s definitely Version 1.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Immature’’ is exactly what Roman Stanek would call it. Mr. Stanek founded GoodData in 2007 with the mission of disrupting business intelligence. Amazon had just started Amazon Web Services and GoodData became a client. It was not an entirely happy experience, Mr. Stanek said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Imagine if your electric company didn’t know whether it would be up or down — if they told you, ‘No guarantees, but we believe it will be mostly up,’’’ he said. ‘‘Maybe that works for some clients.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services had well-publicized failures in October 2012, and two months later. But reliability is not a problem specific to Amazon. Mr. Masterson pointed out that Hewlett-Packard, which publishes its service agreements on the web, says it has 99.95 percent availability, which works out to about four hours of trouble a year. The service agreement also says a failure counts only if it lasts for more than six minutes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Imagine a company selling a premium new car whose warranty includes 2M piston revolutions, 10k door latch cycles, and 20k window open and closes,’’ Mr. Masterson wrote in a recent blog post. ‘‘And even then, with 99.5 percent availability, you might still be unable to start the car two days a year, or during winter there might be two weeks where the doors won’t unlock until the sun melts the ice in the door locks. Ready to buy?’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Staten said the last companies to go to the cloud would be those that had no experience with it — hospitals, medical device makers, and architecture and construction companies. ‘‘The reason they should go last is they don’t yet know what they don’t know,’’ he said. ‘‘They’ll start with applications that do not involve compliant data or customer data.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In general, he said, ‘‘it’s hard to make a case for organizations that should not go to cloud at all.’’ It is not like outsourcing, which faltered over communications issues and rising prices in the host countries, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140612ea6d0008e</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_025.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark44">finance</a><a name="bookmark45">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon stops taking preorders for videos; Block on Warner movies is latest move in retailer’s battle with suppliers</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">615 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Everything Store is shrinking again. Amazon customers who want to order forthcoming Warner Home Video features, including ‘‘The Lego Movie,’’ ‘‘300: Rise of an Empire,’’ ‘‘Winter’s Tale’’ and ‘‘Transcendence,’’ are finding it impossible to do so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer’s refusal to sell the movies is part of its effort to gain leverage in yet another major confrontation with a supplier to become public in recent weeks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a standoff with the Hachette Book Group, Amazon is refusing to take advance orders and delaying shipments. Amazon and Hachette are wrangling over e-book terms. The retailer is in a third standoff in Germany, with the Bonnier Media Group.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Disputes between retailers and vendors happen every day. What is unusual here is not Amazon’s relentless desire to gain margin from its suppliers, but the suppliers’ growing resolve to hold the line. If other suppliers adopt the same attitude, that might have significant implications for Amazon’s pell-mell growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The confrontations indicate that Amazon’s long-stated desire to sell everything to everybody might be taking a back seat. The biggest book release in the middle of June is the new J.K. Rowling novel from Hachette; the biggest movie is ‘‘Lego.’’ Amazon is basically telling its customers to go elsewhere for them, which is a very un-Amazon thing to do.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon started refusing preorders for the Time Warner movies in mid-May. That frustrated some customers, who voiced their displeasure on its forums.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This has got to be the most eagerly awaited 2014 movie being released so far — kids’ movie, adults like it too, the first good 2014 film,’’ one movie buff wrote about ‘‘Lego.’’ ‘‘Oh well, Amazon may be digging their own grave if they keep this up.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer’s page for the movies says that customers’ only option is to sign up to be notified when they become available.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The Lego Movie’’ is not even featured in Amazon’s list of forthcoming ‘‘Kids &amp; Family’’ movies. Such lists are a big driver of preorders. The Blu-ray of ‘‘The Lego Movie,’’ due out next week, languishes at No. 18,183. The Blu-ray of ‘‘300’’ is ranked 105,389.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Warner Bros. spokesman said it was the company’s ‘‘general policy not to comment on contract terms or any other proprietary information having to do with our partners.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the middle of the Hachette confrontation, Amazon issued a statement saying disputes with suppliers were routine. It also said people who really wanted the books immediately should go to a competitor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is no resolution in sight to the Hachette standoff. Amazon’s tactics with Warner Home Video are unlikely to provoke as much of an uproar, since DVDs do not carry the cultural weight of books. And the films are readily available from other vendors, including Target and Barnes &amp; Noble. Neither does Amazon seem to be imposing</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lengthy shipping delays on the DVDs once they go on sale, one of the things that provoked particular ire with Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The delays with Hachette books took weeks to become public. So have the issues with the videos. ‘‘Considering all the press regarding Hachette it seems strange that no one is reporting this,’’ one commentator wrote on the Amazon forum.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the few websites that did notice something was going on with the movies was Digital Bits, which briefly noted that it had learned ‘‘through industry sources’’ that ‘‘preorders on Warner titles have been suspended’’ until there is a new contract.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140611ea6c0005w</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_026.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark46">BITS</a><a name="bookmark47">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTF</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Even Early Adopters See Major Flaws in the Cloud</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,105 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 8</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. The C.I.A. isn&#39;t afraid of the cloud.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, a relative baby in the field of technology services, triumphed over stalwart IBM to gain a $600 million</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">C.I.A. contract, but the most remarkable part of the deal was that the agency was a cloud convert in the first place. The fact that a tech company could warehouse data involving the government&#39;s spies is the clearest signal yet that cloud computing is having its moment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Somewhat like outsourcing a decade ago, cloud computing is the coming technology destined to sweep away all before it. Amazon Web Services is the fastest-growing part of fast-growing Amazon, and analysts expect it someday to be the dominant part of the company. Google, IBM, Verizon, Microsoft and a host of smaller players are competing for a part of the action. Global spending on public cloud services alone is forecast to hit $210 billion in 2016, up 172 percent from 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And yet outsourcing provides a cautionary tale of how enthusiasm can be derailed by reality. Outsourcing advocates said every customer service call, every information technology fix, even the creation of routine legal documents was destined to be done in India or the Philippines. They said this would be cheaper and more efficient. American companies would be hollowed out, with only executives and their aides left on the payroll.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It didn&#39;t happen quite that way. While many companies outsourced routine tasks, some moved them back after complaints of poor service. Others never outsourced. Outsourcing was ultimately a segment of the market rather than becoming the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloud computing is already confronting similar issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Members of the Open Data Center Alliance, a consortium of global information technology companies like Infosys, Disney, Deutsche Telekom and SAP, are cloud enthusiasts. But in a recent alliance survey, two-thirds of the members said concerns about data security were delaying their move to the cloud. That was down from the 80 percent of respondents who expressed a concern about security the previous year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other results, however, are headed away from cloud computing. Fifty-six percent of members now say regulatory issues will limit their adoption, up from 47 percent. And 47 percent worry about being tied to one vendor, up from 39 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloud computing &#39;&#39;is kind of in the first wave,&#39;&#39; said Michael Masterson, director of cloud solutions for Compuware, which helps clients improve the performance of their applications. &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d call it immature, but it&#39;s definitely Version 1.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;Immature&#39;&#39; is exactly what Roman Stanek would call it. Mr. Stanek founded GoodData in 2007 with the mission of disrupting business intelligence. Amazon had just started Amazon Web Services, and GoodData became a client. It was not an entirely happy experience, Mr. Stanek said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Imagine if your electric company didn&#39;t know whether it would be up or down -- if they told you, &#39;No guarantees, but we believe it will be mostly up,&#39; &#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Maybe that works for some clients.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services had well-publicized failures in October 2012 and two months later. But reliability is not a problem specific to Amazon. Mr. Masterson pointed out that Hewlett-Packard, which publishes its service agreements on the web, says it has 99.95 percent availability, which works out to about four hours of trouble a year. The service agreement also says a failure only counts if it lasts for more than six minutes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Imagine a company selling a premium new car whose warranty includes 2M piston revolutions, 10k door latch cycles, and 20k window open and closes,&#39;&#39; Mr. Masterson wrote in a recent blog post. &#39;&#39;And even then, with 99.5 percent availability, you might still be unable to start the car two days a year, or during winter there might be two weeks where the doors won&#39;t unlock until the sun melts the ice in the door locks. Ready to buy?&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GoodData grew with Amazon. It has raised more than $75 million and has nearly 300 employees. But in the first quarter, the company left Amazon. It moved to a private cloud hosted by Rackspace, which is based near San Antonio. With Rackspace, it had more control. The only thing worse than a company offering unreliable service appears to be a company whose very existence is in doubt. Nirvanix was a cloud company based in San Diego with impressive backers, including Intel Capital and Khosla Ventures, and impressive hype. It was going to take on the big boys, Amazon Web Services and Google.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last Sept. 16, Nirvanix warned customers they had two weeks to retrieve their data. On Oct. 1, it filed for bankruptcy. Apparently all customers got their data out, but it was a near miss. Then last month Rackspace, whose stock dropped by half since the beginning of 2013, said it was hiring Morgan Stanley to advise it on a possible sale or merger. While profitable, Rackspace faces increasing competition.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Companies that fail or are sold would matter less if data was more portable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It&#39;s still difficult to tap into Rackspace and change your mind, or tap into AWS and change to something else,&#39;&#39; said James Staten, an analyst with Forrester Research. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re a long way from sufficient standards where that&#39;s a possibility.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Staten said the last companies to go to the cloud would be those that had no experience with it -- hospitals, medical device makers, and architecture and construction companies. &#39;&#39;The reason they should go last is they don&#39;t yet know what they don&#39;t know,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;They&#39;ll start with applications that do not involve compliant data or customer data.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In general, he said, &#39;&#39;it&#39;s hard to make a case for organizations that should not go to cloud at all.&#39;&#39; It is not like outsourcing, which faltered over communications issues and rising prices in the host countries, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GoodData expects to ultimately go full circle as competition increases. &#39;&#39;This used to be very much Amazon&#39;s monopoly, and a one-horse race was not good,&#39;&#39; Mr. Stanek said. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s why I&#39;m happy to see Google get in. In a couple of years, you will be able to go to Google or Amazon and say, &#39;Give me the features I need, the service agreements and a good price, and I will have no reason to build my own cloud.&#39; &#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SEATTLE -- From his ninth-floor office in downtown Seattle, Hewlett-Packard&#39;s cloud computing outpost, Bill Hilf can see the Space Needle, the Pike Street Market and the future of computing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;There&#39;s two security companies setting up over there,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Hilf, the vice president of cloud product management at HP, pointing east. Toward the waterfront is Blue Box, a cloud hosting company. South, in Pioneer Square, is a cloud engineering outpost of EMC, a data storage giant, as well as lots more start-ups.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It&#39;s like Detroit used to be for car companies,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The galactic players are here, and they are creating lots of little companies. The only thing driving anyone away from here is the weather.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Rain or shine, Seattle has quickly become the center of the most intensive engineering in cloud computing: the design and management of global-scale data centers. Last year, Mr. Hilf was hired from Microsoft&#39;s giant cloud business, Azure, to spearhead HP&#39;s efforts to build its own cloud service (based in Seattle, not at HP&#39;s home in Silicon Valley), and build technology for other cloud companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was a 13-minute drive from Microsoft to his new office, above the Seattle convention center. Amazon Web Services, the biggest of the cloud companies, is a six-minute walk from HP, in downtown Seattle. North over Queen Anne Hill, in the Fremont district, Google has a thousand engineers working on its cloud system. In Kirkland, near Microsoft, there is another Google facility.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s too early to say if this concentration of big engineering talent is sustainable over the long haul and whether it will evolve into a flywheel of innovation like Silicon Valley. For now, however, it appears to be attracting a lot of money and talent, eager to grow in the cloud.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I could be completely wrong, but it seems like the valley is focusing on consumer stuff, like search and social, while we&#39;re building infrastructure, things that are a lot harder to learn,&#39;&#39; said Jared Wray, chief technology officer of cloud at CenturyLink, a large provider of Internet connectivity to business. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a generational change.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last November, Mr. Wray&#39;s company, a provider of cloud computing services to small and midsize businesses called Tier 3, was bought by CenturyLink for an undisclosed sum. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve grown the engineering team 20 percent, to 100 people, since then,&#39;&#39; Mr. Wray said. &#39;&#39;They want to have 400.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Besides talent that knows how to build infrastructure, Seattle has a number of leading cloud software companies. Tableau Software, a leader in the computer visualization of large sets of data, is across the street from Google in Fremont. Concur, used for online expense forms, is in Bellevue, near Microsoft Azure. Other companies include Chef, which produces open source cloud automation software; Apptio, a cloud monitoring company, and Socrata, which stores and publishes over 100,000 data sets for 150 government organizations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a little more collaborative than the valley, because we still have lots of hard problems to solve in cloud computing,&#39;&#39; said Kevin Merritt, founder and chief executive of Socrata.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Others note that Washington State has tougher noncompete clauses in its labor laws than does California, which can give established firms some peace of mind about setting up shop in Seattle but frustrate venture capitalists by making it harder for people to walk out of one company and start a competitor.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For all the action, Seattle still has only one major venture capital firm, compared with scores of such businesses in Silicon Valley. That firm, Madrona, has participated in 15 cloud deals since March 2012, raising $68 million of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$304 million total venture capital for cloud companies in the Seattle area (the rest came from 20 other investors, mostly in the valley.) Those companies, all still private, are valued at $2.3 billion&#39;&#39;This is the next two years,&#39;&#39; said Matt McIlwain, a partner at Madrona, standing before a whiteboard where he brainstormed more than 20 areas where new cloud businesses might be built. As for the &#39;&#39;relative dearth&#39;&#39; of venture money, he said, the increasing number of people getting rich at the area&#39;s new tech companies would bring in a lot of angel investors in Seattle. &#39;&#39;The big question in town is what Steve Ballmer will do with his money.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Besides, perhaps, buy a basketball team in Los Angeles. (Mr. Ballmer, a former Microsoft chief executive, has agreed to pay $2 billion for the beleaguered Los Angeles Clippers.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The roots of Seattle&#39;s strength in cloud computing, longtime observers say, goes back to the mid-1990s, when Microsoft, long the sole big power in Seattle tech, began doing extensive work in distributed computing, or making computers work together in problem solving. That concept is the root of what cloud computing is today: lots of computer servers working together for various tasks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several Microsoft veterans played key roles building out Amazon&#39;s cloud. In particular, James Hamilton, a former database specialist, is credited with making cloud computing far less expensive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another factor is the growing presence of the University of Washington&#39;s computer science department, now considered a leader in distributed computing. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s an argument that Seattle owns the cloud now,&#39;&#39; said Ed Lazowska, who holds the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates chair in Computer Science and Engineering at the university. &#39;&#39;Universities are always part of the axis&#39;&#39; in building out a regional tech center, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The university, which awards about 250 computer science degrees a year, is now working on courses in machine learning, which is how computers, particularly in the cloud, study and adapt based on big streams of data.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The cloud and big data are closely connected,&#39;&#39; Mr. Lazowska said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re incredibly lucky to be in Seattle.&#39;&#39; This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FUTURISTIC: Seattle&#39;s office towers frame the Space Needle, a 1962 landmark.

Companies that shut down old-style data centers in favor of private or public clouds usually migrate data and applications to the new location.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloud Computing: A method of configuring and delivering computing power on demand. Individual servers and storage, along with networks and software applications, are pooled and shared by various devices like smartphones and laptop computers, allowing easier use and higher performance. Usage is frequently metered, like a utility.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Private Cloud: An instance of cloud computing by a single organization. It may be owned by the organization, or owned and managed by a third party.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Public Cloud: Cloud infrastructure provided for use by the general public, often as a rental service. It may be owned and operated by an academic, government or private organization. The biggest public clouds are believed to belong to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft&#39;s Azure and Google&#39;s Compute Engine. But there are many others.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">N00b: Someone who is new to a subject.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service. Basic computing resources, such as computer processing, networking, data storage and operating systems, offered through a network connection. Consumers usually pay a fee for usage of the infrastructure, which they can configure, add software applications to or use to handle overflows in periods of heavy usage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PaaS: Platform as a Service. A combination of infrastructure and basic computing resources used for coding and deploying software applications, usually for delivery over the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">AWS: Amazon Web Services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">API: Application Programing Interface. A specification of how different software components can interact. Using a cloud API, a software developer can modify or customize a software application to suit the needs of a specific case. Companies are said to &#39;&#39;open&#39;&#39; their APIs when they want third parties to build new things on their product.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SaaS: Software as a Service. Software applications offered as part of a cloud infrastructure, most often on a rental basis to businesses and consumers. Customers do not manage the underlying infrastructure, and receive automatic software updates through a network connection.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CDN: Content Delivery Network. An interconnected system of computers in various locations that store duplicate copies of web content so it can be called up quickly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RFP: Request for Price. A term used to define the expectations in a contract. A company may describe what it needs and then ask for bidders to say how much it will cost them.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Service Provider: An entity that provides individuals and entities access to the Internet or telecommunications services..</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Streaming: Delivery of content, usually audio or video, to a connected device like a tablet. Netflix, for example, streams video to computers and Internet-connected televisions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Elastic Computing: Growing or shrinking the amount of computing resources used to meet different levels of demand. Amazon, for example, sees high demand on its sites on Thanksgiving weekend and in the week before Christmas, and needs additional computing resources. A cloud system is elastic to the degree it can respond to demand changes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distributed Computing: A branch of computer science that deals with how two or more computers can solve problems by coordinated actions.

Since Amazon is the biggest bookseller in the country, that is seriously affecting Hachette. On the other hand, the outrage seems to be mounting. While Amazon has its defenders — the novelist Barry Eisler </a><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/04/war-on-amazon-publishing-writers" class="a" target="_blank">wrote in The Guardian this week</a> <span style=" color: #000;">that the</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">publishing industry has been run “for decades in a way that has benefited the few while stifling new opportunities for the many” – they are greatly outnumbered by its critics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Colbert’s 2012 book, “America Again: Re-Becoming the Greatness We Never Weren’t,” is marked on Amazon as “usually ships in two to four weeks.” To further discourage sales, the book sells at full price instead of the usual discount. Third parties do offer it on Amazon for as little as a penny but Mr. Colbert does not approve, saying “publishers and authors get no cash from used book sales. Plus you don’t want them. Used books are the sluts of the literary world.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He brought on a Hachette author, Sherman Alexie, who plugged the Hachette book, “California,” by Edan Lepucki. Mr. Colbert urged people to buy it at the independent Portland, Ore., store Powell’s, tweeting to his six million followers, “Together we can #CutDownTheAmazon.” Powell’s struggled to keep up with the orders as “California,” a first novel, immediately became its No. 1 best-seller.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Colbert’s show followed the denunciation of Amazon earlier this week by John Green, author of the immensely popular “The Fault In Our Stars.” “What’s ultimately at stake is whether Amazon is going to be able to freely and permanently bully publishers into eventual nonexistence,” said Mr. Green, who is not published by Hachette.

The negotiations reportedly deal with the pricing of electronic books, but the companies are not discussing them publicly. What seems clear is that Amazon is using its market power — the company accounts for about 40 percent of new books, print and digital, sold in the United States and more than 50 percent in Germany — to get the best deal for itself while it squeezes publishers, annoys its customers and hurts authors by limiting their sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At one level, this dispute appears to be the kind of hard-nosed negotiations that always take place when distributors and producers try to figure out how to split the profits from a relatively new business, in this case</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-books. Even as publishers battle Amazon, they themselves are facing demands from some authors and their agents for a bigger slice of e-book profits.

(In Germany, publishers have called on lawmakers to change antitrust laws so they can negotiate contracts jointly with Amazon.) But regulators should keep an eye on this case. There may be grounds to investigate Amazon if its squeezing of Hachette drags on or if it engages in similar actions against other publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It would be best if Amazon simply dropped its bullying tactics and spent its energy reaching agreements with Hachette and Bonnier.

In 2012, the Justice Department sued Apple and five large publishers, arguing that they illegally colluded to fix and raise the price of e-books. Publishers were unhappy that Amazon was deeply discounting some digital books and selling many for $9.99, which, in some cases, was lower than the wholesale cost of the e-book. Apple, by contrast, allowed publishers to set the retail price of e-books and took a commission on each sale. The publishers then forced Amazon to agree to adopt that model of selling</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-books, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Justice Department eventually settled with the publishers and last year won its case against Apple, which is appealing the decision. The settlements and ruling against Apple allowed Amazon to again discount e-books, which led to lower prices but also strengthened Amazon&#39;s already strong position in that segment of the business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It would be best if Amazon simply dropped its bullying tactics and spent its energy reaching agreements with Hachette and Bonnier. The longer this dispute drags on, the more likely it is that some readers will reconsider</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">their relationship with Amazon and start buying books from other retailers. That would surely damage Amazon&#39;s goal of becoming the seller of everything to everyone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020140604ea640007f</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_034.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark62">finance</a><a name="bookmark63">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon and Mattel to create a ‘content hub’ based on children’s show</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By BROOKS BARNES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">844 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">18</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Fireman Sam,’’ a cartoon aimed at preschoolers, has long been a hit outside the United States. Now Mattel and Amazon are teaming up to sell the yellow-hatted hero to American children — a potentially controversial experiment that, if successful, could create a new model for marrying television shows with related merchandise.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon and Hit Entertainment, a division of Mattel, are creating an Amazon.com ‘‘content hub’’ that will — side by side — offer episodes of ‘‘Fireman Sam’’ and the opportunity to buy related toys, books, games, costumes, lunchboxes, T-shirts, hoses, hats, bags, footwear and bikes. Until now, Amazon has mostly kept the video streaming and retail sides of its business separate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This allows us to test the boundaries of how a kids’ franchise can be activated,’’ said Sid Mathur, a Hit Entertainment vice president. ‘‘At the same time, it allows Amazon to transition from a place that simply fulfills consumer demand to one that also creates consumer demand.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fireman Sam episodes and themed merchandise will be sold exclusively at Amazon. About 75 episodes of the cartoon will be available by the end of the year, beginning with 13 on Tuesday; the related consumer products will arrive in October. ‘‘We’re always looking for ways to make parents’ lives easier,’’ Peter Larsen, an Amazon vice president, said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The effort could agitate watchdog groups that monitor marketing to children.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘All of these kids’ shows are made with consumer products in mind, but there is usually no direct link between watching the episode and buying the backpack,’’ said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. ‘‘Does making it easier for consumers to act — what Amazon is all about — present a moral question in this case?’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the cartoon were to run on a traditional television channel, Mr. McQuivey noted, Mattel would be barred from placing ads for Fireman Sam toys during the show or ‘‘adjacent’’ to it under the rules of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit, a division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The Federal Communications Commission also regulates advertising in children’s television.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the Internet is murkier territory. And exactly what constitutes an ad on a shopping site like Amazon, anyway?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Fireman Sam episodes and merchandise will be offered on the same page on Amazon’s primary site, Amazon said it expected children to watch the cartoon through one of its walled services. Kindle FreeTime, for instance, is a subscription-based streaming service that gives children access to preselected shows but prevents them from visiting Amazon’s retail pages or the broader web.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Kindle FreeTime doesn’t allow kids to buy things and contains no ads,’’ Nate Glissmeyer, Amazon’s director of digital product management, Kids and Kindle Products, said in an interview. As for Amazon’s interest in Fireman Sam, Mr. Glissmeyer said, ‘‘He’s about being helpful, which I think is a great message for kids.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The animated firefighter, introduced in Britain in 1985 and aimed at children ages 2 to 5, in recent years has appeared in a limited fashion on Sprout, an American cable channel for preschoolers now owned by NBCUniversal. But the character has never taken off in the United States, in part because Hit Entertainment has been focused on two bigger properties: Thomas &amp; Friends and Bob the Builder.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mattel, which bought Hit Entertainment in 2011 for $680 million, has made popularizing Fireman Sam a priority. Based in El Segundo, Calif., Mattel had a terrible holiday season last year, with sales at its core Fisher-Price preschool unit dropping 13 percent; Barbie also sputtered.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The toy company could have used a time-tested method to ignite interest in Fireman Sam: Sell the show to a TV channel, hope for a big audience and then use ratings to persuade retailers to devote shelf space to themed merchandise. If everything went like clockwork, it would have taken a year to get items in stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But eager to speed up the process — and mindful that children are increasingly consuming cartoons through streaming services and on-demand apps — Hit Entertainment instead approached Amazon. ‘‘Netflix would have brought reach to a certain set of consumers, but Amazon brought that and something else, namely a giant retail platform,’’ Mr. Mathur said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts say Amazon’s status as the world’s largest online retailer is emerging as a significant point of leverage in its battle with Netflix for video programming, at least in certain categories like children’s entertainment. (Nickelodeon left Netflix for Amazon last year as part of a deal valued at several hundred million dollars.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This is a sign of things to come,’’ Mr. McQuivey said of the Fireman Sam partnership, noting that Amazon could easily make similar merchandising deals with home decorating, cooking and health and fitness shows. ‘‘These programs are product placement from beginning to end,’’ he said. ‘‘Amazon is perhaps the only video distributor in the world that can let people immediately act on those impulses.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140602ea630003j</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_035.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark64">B</a><a name="bookmark65">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">AMAZON ABSORBING PRICE FIGHT PUNCHES</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID CARR</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">73 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a young book editor at Little, Brown &amp; Company in 1992, Michael Pietsch paid $80,000 -- $45,000 more than the next-highest bidder -- for a postmodern novel by a little-known writer named David Foster Wallace.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He spent years urging Mr. Wallace to cut hundreds of pages from the sprawling manuscript and impose at least some structure on the disparate plot strands. The book, &#39;&#39;Infinite Jest,&#39;&#39; was finally published in 1996 and became an instant literary sensation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Pietsch is now chief executive of Little, Brown&#39;s parent company, the Hachette Book Group, and is engaged in a very different sort of battle -- not with a fragile author, but with one of the most powerful corporations in the United States: Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the first chief executive of a major publishing house to negotiate new terms with Amazon since the Justice Department sued five publishers in 2012 for conspiring to raise e-book prices, Mr. Pietsch finds himself fighting not just for the future of Hachette, but for that of every publisher that works with Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;In a sense, Michael Pietsch is like &#39;Horatius at the Bridge,&#39; &#39;&#39; says the literary agent and former Amazon executive Laurence J. Kirshbaum, referring to the soldier of legend who single-handedly saved ancient Rome by fighting off an invading army. &#39;&#39;He is carrying the rest of the industry on his back.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because Hachette and Amazon have signed confidentiality agreements as part of their negotiations, the particulars of their dispute have been kept secret. But inside the publishing world, the consensus is that Amazon wants to offer deep discounts on Hachette&#39;s electronic books, and that the negotiations are not going well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The proudly customer-friendly Amazon is delaying shipments and preventing preorders of certain Hachette books, suggesting to potentially frustrated shoppers that they buy them elsewhere. Mr. Pietsch (pronounced peach), ordinarily easygoing and accessible, is refusing to talk to the news media and has told employees to do the same.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is little question that Mr. Pietsch, 56, would not be squaring off against the country&#39;s largest bookseller if it were not an absolute necessity for his company&#39;s bottom line. Friends say he never wanted the negotiations to become public. But now that they have, everyone in the book industry is watching and waiting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We&#39;re all Hachette now,&#39;&#39; one publisher joked last week at the trade fair BookExpo America in Manhattan.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Given his background, Mr. Pietsch, is an unlikely figure to find himself in such a position. He is trained as an editor, not a businessman. He took over Hachette in April 2013, trading a life of poring over manuscripts for one of scrutinizing spreadsheets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like a player-coach, though, he has continued to acquire and edit a small handful of books, most notably Donna Tartt&#39;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, &#39;&#39;The Goldfinch.&#39;&#39; He has built an all-star stable of authors that includes highbrow writers as well as mass-market giants like Michael Connelly and James Patterson.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is unusual for a lifelong editor to become C.E.O. of his own publishing company, but over the years, Mr. Pietsch had developed a reputation as both a man of letters and a shrewd deal maker. The combination could serve him well in his dispute with Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;While I don&#39;t envy his position in this street fight, I think he&#39;s exactly the right guy to be conducting it,&#39;&#39; said Sloan Harris, an agent at International Creative Management.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The son of an Army officer, Mr. Pietsch grew up in Norfolk, Va. He attended Harvard, where he concentrated in English and wrote his senior thesis on Chaucer&#39;s 14th-century work &#39;&#39;The Canterbury Tales.&#39;&#39; During his senior year, Mr. Pietsch interned at a publisher based in Boston, David R. Godine, and liked it so much that he stayed on after graduating.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He eventually moved to New York and spent six years at Scribner -- among other things, editing an unpublished Ernest Hemingway manuscript -- before joining Little, Brown as an editor in 1991. Over the next 10 years, Mr.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pietsch helped transform the company from a sleepy, largely literary house, to a modern, commercial publisher.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Pietsch worked his way up through the ranks there, becoming editor in chief in 1998 and publisher in 2001. Even as a publisher, he was known for being hands-on. After Mr. Wallace committed suicide in 2008, Mr. Pietsch painstakingly assembled the thousands of typed and handwritten manuscript pages that Mr. Wallace had left behind into a posthumously published novel. He also wrote the introduction to that book, &#39;&#39;The Pale King.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A resident of Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., Mr. Pietsch is married to Janet Vultee Pietsch, a children&#39;s book editor. As Hachette&#39;s chief executive, he now oversees not just Little, Brown but all of the publisher&#39;s imprints, which together put out about 1,000 books every year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette has been largely silent since the dispute broke out into the public last month, though it did issue a public statement -- written by Mr. Pietsch -- that underscored its view that books deserve to be treated differently from hard drives, diapers and the countless other products that Amazon sells.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Amazon indicates that it considers books to be like any other consumer good,&#39;&#39; the statement said. &#39;&#39;They are not.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Pietsch received support from one of his authors, Mr. Patterson, who went on a tirade during a luncheon speech last week at BookExpo. &#39;&#39;Amazon also, as you know, wants to control bookselling, book buying, and even book publishing, and that is a national tragedy,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Pietsch&#39;s central role in his industry&#39;s dispute with Amazon seems to be nothing more than sheer happenstance. As part of Hachette&#39;s antitrust settlement with the government, the company agreed to allow Amazon to continue to discount the price of e-books for two years. That agreement has expired, and for some reason -- no one is sure why -- Hachette is the first publisher to find itself in the position of negotiating a new one.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other publishers are holding their breath. It is in their interests for Mr. Pietsch to drive a hard bargain, and they are cheering him on, but silently. They have their own relationships with Amazon to protect, and they do not want anything they say to be construed as antagonistic, all the more so now that Amazon has demonstrated its willingness to punish booksellers when negotiations become contentious.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Mr. Pietsch is a hero to some, he is a reluctant one. &#39;&#39;He doesn&#39;t want to be seen as the warrior against Amazon,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Wallace&#39;s agent, Bonnie Nadell, who has known Mr. Pietsch for 25 years. &#39;&#39;I think that makes him incredibly uncomfortable.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Michael Pietsch at a Glance Age: 56</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Education: Harvard</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Career: Editor at Scribner&#39;s (1979-&#39;85); editor at Harmony (1985-&#39;91); editor at Little, Brown (1991-2001); publisher of Little, Brown (2001-&#39;12); chief executive of the Hachette Book Group (2012-present)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Books and Authors:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Infinite Jest&#39;&#39; by David Foster Wallace &#39;&#39;The Tipping Point&#39;&#39; by Malcolm Gladwell &#39;&#39;The Art of Fielding&#39;&#39; by Chad Harbach &#39;&#39;Life&#39;&#39; by Keith Richards, right</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The Goldfinch&#39;&#39; by Donna Tartt Michael Connelly</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">James Patterson</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Michael Pietsch, chief executive of Hachette.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Updated, 9:07 p.m. | In the dispute between Amazon and Hachette, neither side is blinking.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has been discouraging sales of books published by Hachette in an effort to make the publisher come to terms on a new contract for e-books. The confrontation has dominated publishing and bookselling circles.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has been heavily criticized for using writers as pawns, although it also has its defenders.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last week, Amazon increased the pressure on Hachette by refusing to let customers order future books. Since advance orders are used to determine print runs, even the biggest books will be affected. Amazon is about a third of most publishers&#39; physical sales, presumably including Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s competitors are trying to seize the advantage. Walmart.com, for instance, is promoting Hachette titles at 40 percent off, and said Friday that its online book sales had jumped as a result.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many Hachette authors have weighed in. James Patterson was vehement in his criticism of Amazon, which he repeated at the booksellers&#39; convention in New York this week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But there was one voice that was notably absent: that of Malcolm Gladwell, author of &#39;&#39;David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference&#39;&#39; and other extremely popular social science books. Amazon has trimmed or eliminated the discount on most of his books or added weeks to the shipping time, or both. In Germany, Mr. Gladwell is published by Bonnier, whose books Amazon is also discouraging shoppers from buying.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In his first interview on the clash, Mr. Gladwell did not quite say he felt betrayed by Amazon, but said he was &#39;&#39;surprised and puzzled&#39;&#39; by its actions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here&#39;s a lightly edited account of the conversation:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">You&#39;ve been silent since this story broke. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I was initially asked by Hachette to give them some time to negotiate. It&#39;s easier when things are not being hashed out in the press. But several weeks have passed, so maybe it is appropriate for me to say something.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s hear it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s sort of heartbreaking when your partner turns on you. Over the past 15 years, I have sold millions of dollars&#39; worth of books on Amazon, which means I have made millions of dollars for Amazon. I would have thought I was</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">one of their best assets. I thought we were partners in a business that has done well. This seems an odd way to treat someone who has made you millions of dollars.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">What is happening to your sales? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They have been profoundly affected. Where Amazon used to sell two copies, now it sells one. It&#39;s a pretty big decline.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why is Amazon doing this?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m not privy to the negotiations. But it&#39;s puzzling. Authors like James Patterson and J. K. Rowling drive millions and millions of people to the Amazon site, where presumably they buy everything else Amazon is selling. Why would Amazon turn around and bite the hand that feeds them?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some people think Amazon is hoping to drive a wedge between you and Hachette, so you sign your next book with someone else -- or even with Amazon itself. Then, the theory goes, Hachette will be weak and Amazon can get the contract it wants.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That strategy is too counterintuitive even for me. I don&#39;t think human beings reward those who hurt them. If Amazon wanted me to do something in their interest, I imagine they would do something in my interest. This isn&#39;t.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Most people think Amazon is the Goliath here, although some argue that this is Goliath vs. Goliath. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">There&#39;s no question who is more powerful here: Amazon. Q.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">So is there a way for the underdog to triumph here, like the cases you recount in &#39;&#39;David and Goliath&#39;&#39;? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I don&#39;t think the appropriate framework here is a battle between two people. It&#39;s a partnership. My publishers, Amazon and I have been in business together, an extremely successful business. We should all be celebrating together instead of fighting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s critics would say you were naïve about this being a true partnership. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I don&#39;t think it was destined to blow up. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s entirely impossible to fix. We need Amazon and Amazon needs us. That&#39;s a classic partnership.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Are you personally taking any action? A.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve had the position I need to respect the rights of these two parties to negotiate. I didn&#39;t think to insert myself. But if this keeps going, the authors are going to have to get together. It&#39;s Hachette now, but I don&#39;t think anyone is under any illusions it stops with Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Gladwell or his remarks. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">The author Malcolm Gladwell is published by Hachette.

Maybe it needs the money; One theory about why the retail giant is willing to risk being vilified</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD and MELISSA EDDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">917 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">31 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the course of nearly two decades, Amazon has hewed to a consistent philosophy: It’s all about the customer. The retailer is so devoted to its customers that it takes the profit that would normally go to shareholders and gives it to shoppers in the form of faster delivery and lower prices. It is a brilliant strategy that has propelled the company to the top ranks of American businesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So when Amazon took the rare step of explaining why it decided to hold hostage 5,000 Hachette books when contract negotiations with the publisher failed, it once again said it was all about the customer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘When we negotiate with suppliers, we are doing so on behalf of customers,’’ the retailer said in an unusual statement. ‘‘Negotiating for acceptable terms is an essential business practice that is critical to keeping service and value high for customers in the medium and long term.’’ Amazon suggested that anyone who really wanted a Hachette book should go elsewhere.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In other words, Amazon is willing to alienate those customers upon which it usually lavishes so much attention. And it is willing to be vilified on the Internet for undermining writers, further denting its reputation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To make all that trouble worthwhile, the goal must be pretty tempting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has not really explained what it is after, but here is one compelling theory: The company just doesn’t have enough money to finance everything it wants to do. Rather than trim its ambitions, it is putting one side of its business through the wringer to pay for another.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s no coincidence that the confrontation with Hachette in the United States — and Bonnier in Germany — comes as Wall Street is getting a little restless with Amazon. The retailer has been doing its best to tighten its business, including raising the cost of its Prime membership program. It chopped the royalty rate for self-published audio books. And publishers and customers say books on the site are getting more expensive. (Amazon has hotly denied this.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the same time, however, Amazon is restlessly expanding. It is paying HBO $300 million for the rights to stream programs like ‘‘The Sopranos’’ free to Prime customers. It was reported on Thursday to be introducing a streaming music service this summer. There are new warehouses galore. An Amazon phone is a persistent rumor. All of this development takes money, so even with the tightening, Amazon is barely making a profit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has issued no statement about how it is working for its customers in Germany. It could not pass on to them any savings it achieved in negotiations even if it wanted to, because books have fixed prices in Germany.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There seems a bit of confusion over what is happening in Germany. In its statement, Amazon recommended a blog that makes a strident defense for the company; it’s from a Long Island outfit, the Permanent Press. The blog post says Bonnier is ‘‘known primarily for publishing magazines throughout the Western world and far fewer books.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Surely Amazon knows better than this, even if the Permanent Press does not. Bonnier Media Germany belongs to the Bonnier Media Group, which is based in Sweden. It includes nine German-language publishers of fiction, nonfiction, children’s literature and comics. Bonnier is the third-largest publishing group in Germany, after</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Random House and Holtzbrinck. Internationally known authors published by Bonnier Germany include Isabel Allende, John le Carré, J.K. Rowling, Malcolm Gladwell, Elizabeth Gilbert and William Boyd.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Price negotiations between Amazon and German publishers take place annually and normally last only a month. Bonnier and Amazon started negotiating late last year but have not been able to agree on how to divide the take from e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some people in the German publishing world believe that Amazon focused on Bonnier because it was big enough to set a precedent but was not one of the two heavyweights.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The German pricing law exists to prevent any bookseller from undercutting their rivals. The law is rooted in the country’s belief that books are a necessity to a free-thinking, pluralistic society; one of the most moving monuments to the Nazi-era terror is a white room full of empty bookshelves recalling the volumes burned in 1933. The law is also considered a measure to ensure the survival of smaller bookshops and publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This does not sound like hospitable territory for Amazon, but the company is selling a lot of books in Germany. That must further increase the ire of small booksellers and independent publishers. They view the online giant’s tactics against Bonnier as a political statement against their way of life.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The use of its market position to purposely delay delivery of books from selected publishers in order to pressure them to accept their demands for conditions is not only a threatening sign for the book industry, but a clear affront to those who read and buy books,’’ wrote a group of some 880 independent booksellers and publishers, members of a loose organization that calls itself the Booksellersmeeting in protest against Amazon’s action.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which has the further problem of labor troubles in Germany, does not seem worried. Perhaps it is confident the complaints will blow over. And perhaps it really needs the money.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A strong contender for quote of the month comes from Dennis Loy Johnson, of the small publishing firm Melville House. &#39;&#39;How is this not extortion?&#39;&#39; he said to David Streitfeld and Melissa Eddy of The Times, in a story published last week. &#39;&#39;You know, that thing that is illegal when the Mafia does it.&#39;&#39; He was referring to Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As you&#39;ve undoubtedly heard, Amazon and Hachette, the big publishing house, are in a pricing dispute. Pricing disputes, of course, take place all the time, but they don&#39;t usually include accusations of extortion. Walmart became a giant, low-cost retailer by constantly squeezing its suppliers for better -- i.e. lower -- prices. Cable companies regularly get into pricing squabbles with television networks. Even in the book business, pricing disputes are not uncommon. In its heyday, Barnes &amp; Noble was constantly fighting with publishers to get better prices, so it could offer bigger discounts on best-selling books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Barnes &amp; Noble never had the kind of power that Amazon has. Publishers Weekly reports that in March, Amazon commanded 41 percent of all new books sold, and a staggering 65 percent of all online books sold, whether print or digital, according to research conducted by the Codex Group. Borders, a once-viable bookseller, is gone. Barnes &amp; Noble has never been terribly successful as an online store, and its Nook e-reader is a dismal failure. Independent booksellers have been marginalized.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the years, as Amazon became increasingly powerful, publishers began whispering about how someday that power would be abused. Amazon has always pushed hard for the lowest price possible, but what would happen if it truly became a monopoly? Wouldn&#39;t it then be able to raise prices at will, hurting book buyers? As its dispute with Hachette illustrates, Amazon is more than willing to flex its powerful muscles. It can now take weeks instead of days to get a Hachette-published book from Amazon. Amazon won&#39;t allow customers to pre-order Hachette books before they are published. Earlier this week, Amazon put out a statement acknowledging that it was doing these things because of the dispute.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But its goal is not to raise prices, which is contrary to Amazon&#39;s pro-consumer culture. Instead, it is trying to upend the economic model that has long sustained book publishers. No wonder the stakes feel so high, and the fear and loathing so palpable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The story really began some years ago, when Amazon began issuing a standard price for e-books of $9.99 -- in some cases selling below cost. Publishers feared that they would become locked into the $9.99 price the same way the music industry had been locked into 99-cent songs by Apple&#39;s iTunes service. They fought back by joining forces with Apple, cutting preferable deals to participate in Apple&#39;s e-book-selling service, and then forcing Amazon to go along with the same terms. E-book prices quickly rose.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unfortunately for the publishers, their brilliant idea turned out to be an illegal conspiracy, and the government forced them to settle on terms that had the effect of boosting Amazon. Although Amazon has not entirely reverted back to $9.99 e-books, it could if it wanted to, and it has in some cases. In other cases -- especially with</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">self-published books or romances -- e-book prices are down to $5.99 and even $2.99. &#39;&#39;There is a strong gravitational pull downward,&#39;&#39; said one publisher (who did not want to be quoted, fearing Amazon&#39;s wrath).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The way I hear it, what Amazon is insisting upon is a deal where it would no longer have to bear the full brunt of its discounting -- the publisher would have to bear some of it, in the form of tighter margins, or even losses.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette, meanwhile, contends that it needs to be compensated for the important things publishers do: editing, marketing, and curating.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is an argument that may appeal to the cultural elite, but it is unlikely to move Jeff Bezos, Amazon&#39;s founder and chief executive. Publishers, he has been known to say, are gatekeepers. &#39;&#39;Even well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation,&#39;&#39; he wrote in his 2011 letter to shareholders, according to Brad Stone, the author of a recent book about Amazon, &#39;&#39;The Everything Store.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No matter what you think of Amazon&#39;s tactics, they surely don&#39;t violate any laws. It is acting the way hardheaded companies usually act -- inflicting some pain on the party in a dispute to move it toward resolution. On some level, the book industry has never fit comfortably in the contours of big business. But over the years, as one house after another was bought by conglomerates, as they merged with each other, as they tried to increase profits with the kind of regularity that pleases Wall Street, they began the process of commoditizing books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos?

Since advance orders are used to determine print runs, even the biggest books will be affected. Amazon is about a third of most publishers’ physical sales, presumably including Hachette.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s competitors are trying to seize the advantage. Walmart.com, for instance, is promoting Hachette titles at 40 percent off, and said Friday that its online book sales had jumped as a result.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/05/james-patterson-calls-out-amazon-at-book-expo.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Many Hachette authors have weighed in. James Patterson was vehement in his criticism of Amazon, which he </a><a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/05/james-patterson-calls-out-amazon-at-book-expo.html" class="a" target="_blank">repeated at the booksellers’ convention</a> <span style=" color: #000;">in New York this week.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But there was one voice that was notably absent: that of Malcolm Gladwell, author of “David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants,” “The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference” and other extremely popular social science books. Amazon has trimmed or eliminated the discount on most of his books or added weeks to the shipping time, or both. In Germany, Mr. Gladwell is published by Bonnier, whose books Amazon is also discouraging shoppers from buying.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In his first interview on the clash, Mr. Gladwell did not quite say he felt betrayed by Amazon, but said he was “surprised and puzzled” by its actions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here’s a lightly edited account of the conversation:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">You’ve been silent since this story broke. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I was initially asked by Hachette to give them some time to negotiate. It’s easier when things are not being hashed out in the press. But several weeks have passed, so maybe it is appropriate for me to say something.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let’s hear it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s sort of heartbreaking when your partner turns on you. Over the past 15 years, I have sold millions of dollars’ worth of books on Amazon, which means I have made millions of dollars for Amazon. I would have thought I was one of their best assets. I thought we were partners in a business that has done well. This seems an odd way to treat someone who has made you millions of dollars.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">What is happening to your sales? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They have been profoundly affected. Where Amazon used to sell two copies, now it sells one. It’s a pretty big decline.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why is Amazon doing this?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I’m not privy to the negotiations. But it’s puzzling. Authors like James Patterson and J. K. Rowling drive millions and millions of people to the Amazon site, where presumably they buy everything else Amazon is selling. Why would Amazon turn around and bite the hand that feeds them?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some people think Amazon is hoping to drive a wedge between you and Hachette, so you sign your next book with someone else — or even with Amazon itself. Then, the theory goes, Hachette will be weak and Amazon can get the contract it wants.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That strategy is too counterintuitive even for me. I don’t think human beings reward those who hurt them. If Amazon wanted me to do something in their interest, I imagine they would do something in my interest. This isn’t.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Most people think Amazon is the Goliath here, although some argue that this is Goliath vs. Goliath. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">There’s no question who is more powerful here: Amazon. Q.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">So is there a way for the underdog to triumph here, like the cases you recount in “David and Goliath”? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I don’t think the appropriate framework here is a battle between two people. It’s a partnership. My publishers, Amazon and I have been in business together, an extremely successful business. We should all be celebrating together instead of fighting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon’s critics would say you were naïve about this being a true partnership. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I don’t think it was destined to blow up. And I don’t think it’s entirely impossible to fix. We need Amazon and Amazon needs us. That’s a classic partnership.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Are you personally taking any action? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I’ve had the position I need to respect the rights of these two parties to negotiate. I didn’t think to insert myself. But if this keeps going, the authors are going to have to get together. It’s Hachette now, but I don’t think anyone is under any illusions it stops with Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Gladwell or his remarks.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon and Hachette took their cases to the public on Wednesday as a dispute over contract terms became clashing visions about the distribution of information in the digital age.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On one side is a publisher whose roots stretch back to 1837. On the other is a technology company that has single-handedly upended just about every part of the relationship between readers and their books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The publishing community, which is assembling in New York this week for the annual bookselling show, is watching in uneasy fascination. Publishers know that whatever terms Hachette ends up with, they will all get.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The issues at play are a matter of life and death for Hachette,&#39;&#39; said Jeremy Greenfield, editorial director of Digital Book World. &#39;&#39;This is about controlling the future of book publishing.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon wants to do away with gatekeepers. It promises a world where books are cheap, where anyone can publish anything, where there are no editors or distributors saying this is not what is selling now, go away.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette is holding fast to the traditional publishing system that underpins modern culture. It was a world where publishers bankrolled writers in return for a large cut of the proceeds, where editors improved prose and sharpened arguments, and where books were selected and presented rather than simply released. They cost more, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Amazon indicates that it considers books to be like any other consumer good,&#39;&#39; Hachette said in a statement. &#39;&#39;They are not.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are many considerations here besides money, the publisher said, noting that authors are engaging &#39;&#39;in a complex and difficult mission to communicate with readers.&#39;&#39; It added, &#39;&#39;In addition to royalties, they are concerned with audience, career, culture, education, art, entertainment and connection.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The only thing the publisher and the retailer agree on is that there is no deal in sight, and 5,000 Hachette books are caught in the middle. Amazon said that if customers ordered them, it would ship them -- eventually.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We are not optimistic that this will be resolved soon,&#39;&#39; Amazon said in its statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette said any resolution would have to &#39;&#39;value appropriately&#39;&#39; the publisher&#39;s role in editing, marketing and distributing books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Amazon&#39;s mission to remove all barriers between readers and writers, the biggest obstacle is the New York publishers, which for the most part still publish the writers whom people want to read. But Amazon controls the Kindle e-reader platform and sees no reason a publisher like Hachette should receive so much of the revenue from a digital book. That was where the negotiations failed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The eventual winner is hard to forecast. Amazon faces criticism across the Internet, so much so that it complained in its statement about the voluminous coverage expressing &#39;&#39;a relatively narrow point of view.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon promoted instead a small publisher&#39;s blog that offered a &#39;&#39;wider&#39;&#39; -- as in, pro-Amazon -- perspective.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Authors published by the traditional houses, including Hachette, argue that their livelihood is at stake, and that the world where Amazon is the only gatekeeper would be a deeply problematic one. There have been vows of boycotts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon is content to play the long game, as usual, and seems confident that Hachette authors will ultimately grow restive and blame the publisher. The publisher&#39;s oldest line is Little, Brown, which has published books like Edward Gibbon&#39;s &#39;&#39;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&#39;&#39; and David Foster Wallace&#39;s &#39;&#39;Infinite Jest.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One thing is clear: The publishing business, once a profession for gentlemen, now resembles &#39;&#39;The Sopranos&#39;&#39; -- which Amazon just paid handsomely for the rights to stream.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The origins of the current confrontation go back at least four years. When Amazon felt threatened then by publishers demanding a different pricing system for e-books, it had two responses: It removed the &#39;&#39;buy&#39;&#39; buttons from one publisher, and sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission with accusations of illegal behavior. The buttons were soon restored, but the publishers were hit by a government antitrust suit whose consequences are still being felt.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now the situation is reversed, with Amazon in the dominant position. Is there a role for regulators this time around? According to a leading antitrust lawyer, there might be.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;This situation is rife with antitrust risk&#39;&#39; for Amazon, said William MacLeod, chairman of the antitrust and competition practice group at the Washington firm Kelley Drye.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Under U.S. law, even a monopolist can refuse to deal or can charge what the market will bear,&quot; said Mr. MacLeod, the former director of the F.T.C.&#39;s Bureau of Consumer Protection. &#39;&#39;But if the activity has the potential to create or entrench market power, a company&#39;s exclusionary conduct or imposition of onerous terms could indeed run afoul of the law.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon declined to comment on Wednesday on antitrust topics. While it issued its statement defending itself, it also tried to take a nothing-to-see-here approach. &#39;&#39;This business interruption affects a small percentage of Amazon&#39;s demand-weighted units,&#39;&#39; it pointed out. (Demand-weighted means the things that people are actually buying.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If customers really wanted any of those 5,000 Hachette books immediately, Amazon said, they could go &#39;&#39;to one of our competitors.&#39;&#39; It was an extraordinary declaration from a company that has striven to be the &#39;&#39;everything&#39;&#39; store, merchandising an ever-increasing pile of goods in ever-increasing ways.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The retailer has had great success in reworking the publishing industry, partly because it has focused so relentlessly on customers that they always knew they were getting a better deal. Thanks to Wall Street&#39;s unwavering support, Amazon could afford to sell books for what it paid for them -- something no physical bookseller could do.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It also paid higher royalty rates on e-books it published itself than the traditional publishers did on their e-books. All those editors and other legacy overhead needed their cut.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But even those who believed Amazon was ushering in a utopia of publishing were jolted a few months ago when it abruptly chopped the royalty rates on self-published audiobooks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I&#39;m shocked that Amazon would do anything to fuel the speculation that once they grow big enough, authors will suffer,&#39;&#39; wrote Hugh Howey, an author who is usually a champion of Amazon&#39;s way of doing things.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon warehouse in England. Amazon said that customers who wanted Hachette books immediately could go elsewhere.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. I know I have to pay extra, but how do I turn off the commercials on my Kindle Fire screen?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A. Amazon refers to certain Fire tablet and e-readers as &#39;&#39;Kindle With Special Offers.&#39;&#39; These &#39;&#39;special offers&#39;&#39; -- or as many people call them, advertisements -- appear as screen savers, on the lock screen or at the bottom of the home screen. Amazon also has &#39;&#39;limited time special offers&#39;&#39; on newer Kindle Fire models to provide discounts on selected items, as explained at amazon.com/exclusivefireoffers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While the ads do not appear on the pages of books you buy for the Kindle, they do subsidize the overall cost of the hardware. To pay for ad removal, log into your Amazon account at amazon.com/manageyourkindle or go to the Your Account page and in the Digital Content area, click on &#39;&#39;Manage Your Content and Devices.&#39;&#39; Next, click on &#39;&#39;Manage Your Devices&#39;&#39; and select your Kindle to display its details. Next to &#39;&#39;Special Offers,&#39;&#39; click Edit and follow along.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Depending on the type of Kindle, it typically costs $15 or $20 to unsubscribe from the special offers -- which is around the price difference with the Kindle models that come ad-free out of the box. Once you unsubscribe, your Amazon account is billed accordingly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Using an iPad As the Hot Spot</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. If my home broadband connection goes out, how hard is it to turn my new 4G iPad into a mobile hot spot so I can get my laptop online?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Sharing the iPad&#39;s cellular-data connection -- and its monthly allowance -- with your laptop through the Personal Hotspot feature in iOS 7 is not difficult, although you should contact your wireless carrier to see if any additional fees or particular data plans are required. AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon all offer cellular iPads now and also have information about using the personal hot spot, also known as &#39;&#39;tethering,&#39;&#39; on their websites. Some prepaid data plans, like those from Verizon, include mobile hot spot use.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You may also get a link to contact your carrier the first time you set up the Personal Hotspot feature. On the iPad&#39;s home screen, open the Settings icon and select Cellular Data.

They answer our needs almost before we can express them, which means they ceaselessly extend their domination of our minds and wallets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">News that reflects poorly on these companies tends to do little permanent damage, whether it is privacy issues, bullying behavior or poor treatment of workers. People care, in theory, but it is not in front of them the way the product or service itself is.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Working in an Amazon warehouse might seem pretty miserable, in other words, but all a customer sees is that something ordered on Monday shows up on the doorstep on Wednesday. It’s like magic.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even if customers care a lot, protesting can be difficult. On the Amazon ‘‘Help and Customer Service’’ page, for example, there are all sorts of prominent instructions about how to return items or track packages, but none are about giving feedback to Amazon itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This was the situation that confronted Ardelle Cowie when she heard that Amazon had begun delaying delivery of books from the publisher Hachette to its customers by as much as a month. Amazon was apparently trying to squeeze Hachette for better terms by causing trouble for readers and authors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I am a big fan of Amazon and spend as much as $5,000 per year there (not just books),’’ Ms. Cowie, a Connecticut investor and landlord, wrote me. ‘‘But this treatment of Hachette is completely unacceptable. I called Amazon today to let them know that I will boycott them until this Hachette dispute is resolved.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The call did not go well. Ms. Cowie said she was unable to convince the help-desk person that she did not have a complaint about a delivery but had a complaint about Amazon itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She contemplated a bolder course of action. Instead, Ms. Cowie, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister who instilled early a sense of right and wrong, just quit Amazon, or tried to.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I’m feeling a bit like I decided to go on a hunger strike but did so in the privacy of my own home without letting anybody know,’’ she wrote a week later. ‘‘I’ve certainly missed Amazon. I bought three bird-watching books from Barnes &amp; Noble about a week ago. So far, I’ve received one.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Cowie had other problems. Amazon had the clothing hangers she wanted, but no one else did.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘I’m convinced that Amazon will not make any effort to regain me since they can rely on getting me back due to the magnetism of their efficiency and their massive stock of everything,’’ she wrote. ‘‘So, feeling as isolated as I do in my feeble protest, I believe I’ll call it quits soon if there is no prospect of it making a difference to anyone.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This sort of experience could be why Amazon, which declined to comment, might think it will get what it wants from Hachette. On Friday, however, Ms. Cowie’s resolve stiffened with the news that Amazon had escalated its campaign against Hachette. She signed up for another bookseller’s express shipping plan. ‘‘I am actually not missing Amazon right now,’’ she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140526ea5r0003m</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_046.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark86">Business/Financial Desk; SECT</a><a name="bookmark87">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Strategy Raises Hackles in Germany</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MELISSA EDDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,302 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">27 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The International New York Times English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BERLIN -- It was German authors, carefully monitoring their Amazon rankings, who were among the first to notice something was amiss.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a country where efficiency is prized as highly as the written word, Amazon was suddenly saying it could take as many as 11 days to deliver some older titles -- inconceivable given that a system of distributors ensuring deliveries within 24 hours has existed for decades, predating online book sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Only when the German division of the Bonnier Media Group wrote to its authors and agents several weeks ago to apologize for the delays did an explanation emerge. Bonnier, one of Germany&#39;s largest publishing groups, said it was in negotiations with Amazon over how to share the earnings of its electronic books. The delays appeared to be a tactic aimed at forcing the publisher to give Amazon, the American retailing giant that has come to dominate book sales, a bigger cut of the proceeds.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like their counterparts in the United States who have felt the force of Amazon&#39;s clout, German book agents are chafing. &#39;&#39;This is above all about the future market and the e-book market,&#39;&#39; said Matthias Landwehr, a literary agent who represents many of the authors affected.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So far, unlike in the United States, where Amazon has been discouraging customers from buying new and coming titles from Hachette by making it impossible to order or pre-order, the tactics in Germany involve only delays in deliveries of backlist titles of authors published by houses owned by the Bonnier Media Group.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But in Europe, where the clout of American Internet giants is already deeply resented, whether on privacy grounds in the case of Google, or by their sheer marketing might, Amazon may find itself facing rules and resistance of sorts it has not encountered in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other European countries like France and Britain do not appear to be affected so far by Amazon&#39;s actions. Sales of Hachette&#39;s books via Amazon&#39;s site in France did not appear to be impeded; Hachette&#39;s French division declined to comment. Nor have other leading German publishers been targets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, many in the publishing world here contend that Amazon has used the negotiations with the German Bonnier imprints, which include Piper, Ullstein, Carlsen and Berlin Verlag, to send a message.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;They are using them to set an example and counting on the fact that publishers are not allowed to speak with one another,&#39;&#39; Mr. Landwehr said of Amazon, citing potential antitrust concerns on the publishers&#39; part if they should compare notes. &#39;&#39;But if they can get them to change the existing conditions with one publisher, it would trigger a domino effect.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon did not respond to requests seeking comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is no stranger to conflict in Europe. This year, French lawmakers approved what has become known informally as the &#39;&#39;anti-Amazon law,&#39;&#39; which restricts online vendors from offering free delivery on top of the country&#39;s maximum 5 percent discount on books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Germany, the company came under fire last year for its use of immigrant workers and Amazon workers in two of the largest distribution plants have been struggling to unionize.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the new dispute marks the first time the American company has confronted head-on the country&#39;s tradition of protecting the printed word.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Germany has prided itself since the 19th century on being the home of &#39;&#39;Dichter und Denker,&#39;&#39; or poets and philosophers. As in several other European countries, including France, Austria and Italy, books in Germany are considered of such indispensable value to society that publishers are allowed to dictate the prices at which retailers can sell all new titles, including best sellers and e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That law also is aimed at ensuring the survival of a thriving network of bookshops. The German Publishers and Booksellers Association counts 3,800 across this country of 80.7 million people, from larger chain stores to traditional antique booksellers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet in a country where shopping hours are also tightly controlled by the government, Germans are becoming increasingly accustomed to the ease and independence of ordering books at all hours and having them delivered to their front doors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Germany&#39;s book-order business, including online sales, grew by 4 percent last year to 2.7 billion euros, or $3.7 billion, according to the Federation of Mail-Order Booksellers. Amazon towered above its competitors, controlling more than half of the German market, with sales of €1.9 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has an even stronger hold on the e-book market here, despite attempts by German publishers to create an alternative open-source platform to compete with the Amazon Kindle format. E-book sales in Germany grew 200 percent from 2012 to 2013, and experts predict that number will only increase.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But given German price-setting laws, Amazon has little wiggle room in Germany for increasing its share of the income generated by e-books. While Amazon receives a 50-50 percent cut of all printed books sold in Germany, the standard rate for e-books gives the company just 30 percent of the sales price, with the remainder going to the publisher, who then pays authors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon appears to be banking on the strength of its position to push for a larger share of the proceeds, hoping to eventually reach the parity it enjoys on printed books, said Christian Russ, an attorney who specializes in publishing law.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;The publishers are not allowed to react under the current antitrust laws,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Every individual publisher is forced to deal with these demands, because they cannot break with a company that accounts for 50 percent of the market.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The German booksellers association has responded by calling on lawmakers to adapt antitrust laws to better fit the digital market, which would allow publishers to band together. It is also pushing lawmakers to grant e-books the same value-added-tax exemptions that printed books receive. The tax now on e-books is 19 percent, compared with 7 percent for printed books, which further reduces the wiggle room for price negotiations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The European Commission has ruled against allowing member states to lower their V.A.T. rates on e-books, although both France and Luxembourg, where digital copies of books are taxed at 7 percent and 3 percent, respectively, have ignored that edict.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The commission on Monday had no comment on the Bonnier publishers&#39; dispute with Amazon, a spokeswoman said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Landwehr, the literary agent, contends that ultimately Amazon wants to drive authors away from the traditional system of agents and publishers, and have them sign directly with the company&#39;s Kindle Direct Publishing. He said he counsels authors against such arrangements, pointing to what he considers the heavy-handed tactics the company is using against Bonnier.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Public reaction by German authors has been generally muted, although many have reached out to their publishers asking how they can show their support, Siv Bublitz, chief executive of the Ullstein publishing, wrote in an email.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;We have asked them to show restraint at the moment, because we are in talks with Amazon and do not want to exacerbate the conflict from our side,&#39;&#39; Ms. Bublitz said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Joscha Sauer, a cartoonist whose works are published by Carlsen, is one of the few who swiftly took to social media to decry Amazon for &#39;&#39;blackmailing several publishers.&#39;&#39; He said that he has &#39;&#39;no clue&#39;&#39; whether sales of his backlisted books have been affected.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It is theoretically possible that through the dispute, even more people have become aware of my work,&#39;&#39; Mr. Sauer said in a telephone interview from Frankfurt. &#39;&#39;From a purely moral standpoint, what Amazon is doing is a dirty trick. From an economic point of view, it is nothing out of the ordinary.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020140527ea5r0003c</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_047.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark88">BITS</a><a name="bookmark89">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">One Woman&#39;s Lonely Boycott of Amazon</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">762 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 5</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

On the Amazon &#39;&#39;Help and Customer Service&#39;&#39; page, for example, there are all sorts of prominent instructions about how to return items or track packages, but none are about giving feedback to Amazon itself. (The answer, dogged investigative reporting reveals, lies in the &#39;&#39;Contact Us&#39;&#39; button off to the side, which takes you through another series of prompts that says you want to talk about &#39;&#39;something else.&#39;&#39;)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This was the situation that confronted Ardelle Cowie when she heard that Amazon had begun delaying delivery of books from Hachette to its customers by as much as a month. Amazon was apparently trying to squeeze Hachette for better terms by causing trouble for its readers and authors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">More than a few people were bothered by this, at least if Twitter is something to go by, but Ms. Cowie seemed more bothered than most.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I am a big fan of Amazon and spend as much as $5,000 per year there (not just books),&#39;&#39; Ms. Cowie, a Connecticut investor and landlord, wrote me. &#39;&#39;But this treatment of Hachette is completely unacceptable. I called Amazon today to let them know that I will boycott them until this Hachette dispute is resolved.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The call did not go well. Ms. Cowie said she was unable to persuade the help-desk person that she did not have a complaint about a delivery but had a complaint about Amazon itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Maybe some tweeting would help, but I&#39;m 68 and don&#39;t know how to manage that,&#39;&#39; she told me. She contemplated a bolder course of action.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It occurred to me,&#39;&#39; she wrote me in another message, &#39;&#39;that I might put things on my wish list but NOT buy them from Amazon.&#39;&#39; Instead, she would buy them elsewhere and let Amazon know that, so the retailer could quantify how much it was losing. &#39;&#39;Is that too complicated for them to understand?&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Yes, she concluded. Instead, Ms. Cowie, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister who instilled early a sense of right and wrong, just quit Amazon. Or tried to.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I&#39;m feeling a bit like I decided to go on a hunger strike but did so in the privacy of my own home without letting anybody know,&#39;&#39; she wrote a week later. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve certainly missed Amazon. I bought three bird-watching books from Barnes &amp; Noble about a week ago. So far, I&#39;ve received one. I need to consult Amazon to make decisions about what I want to order because the customer feedback is so weak at B.&amp;N.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There were other problems. Amazon had the clothing hangers she wanted, but no one else did.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;I&#39;m convinced that Amazon will not make any effort to regain me since they can rely on getting me back due to the magnetism of their efficiency and their massive stock of everything,&#39;&#39; she wrote. &#39;&#39;So, feeling as isolated as I do in my feeble protest, I believe I&#39;ll call it quits soon if there is no prospect of it making a difference to anyone.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Now you know why Amazon expects to win its battle with Hachette, and indeed every battle with its suppliers. A spokesman for the retailer declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On Friday, however, with the news that Amazon was escalating its case against the publisher, her resolve was once again stiffening. Her books, she said, would henceforth be purchased elsewhere.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ardelle Cowie, who says she spends as much as $5,000 a year on Amazon, is protesting Amazon&#39;s treatment of Hachette.

Predictably, given the book’s not-so-subtle allusion to the cover-up of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, it has never been published on the mainland.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His latest novel, “The Unbearable Dreamworld of Champa the Driver,” about a young Tibetan trying to find his way in Beijing, was published in English this month. In an interview, Mr. Chan talked about sex, censorship, Tibet, stolen pets and people opening his mail. Excerpts follow:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Did you try getting “The Fat Years” published on the mainland? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several mainland publishers came to me after the novel got published. I asked them to read it first before we talked. They didn’t come back.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But someone — I don’t know who — typed it up in simplified Chinese and passed it around the Internet, where it stayed for about six months. There were at least two versions — one typed and one scanned — that were widely circulated, mostly as PDFs, until they were deleted. The censors were not so fast back then.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Did a similar thing happen to “Champa”? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This time, the controls are tighter. They are getting better at blocking things. And maybe readers are less keen. There are so many titles in China now. Why would people want to spend their energy looking for the censored ones?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Where do you get your own reading materials? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are one or two really good bookstores in Beijing, plus Amazon China. For English books, I can go to the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Amazon.com and they get through most of the time.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But banned books are a problem. I tried to get my own books — meaning books I had written — sent to me, and they were not allowed in. They are opening my boxes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are you reading?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I’m trying to finish these thick novels by Jonathan Franzen — “The Corrections” and “Freedom.” I’ve also read “2666” by Roberto Bolaño. I’m not courageous enough to write such thick novels for Chinese audiences. And I read “White Teeth” by Zadie Smith. I liked that.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Champa” begins with an affair between a handsome young Tibetan and an older, richer businesswoman. She is the sugar mommy and he is the arm candy. Why did you turn this gender stereotype on its head?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This is something I noticed in real life. Many Chinese women in middle age, when they go to Tibet their behavior changes. They become very flirty with their tour guide or driver — and they’d never do that in Beijing. And these guys are quite handsome.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The protagonist is a Tibetan young man. He is intelligent, but not highly literate. He likes his women, his wine and his cars. I tried to write it as directly as possible. He isn’t deep. He’s deeply flawed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">How does the Tibet you depict differ from the usual stereotypes? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">My ambition was to write an antiromantic novel about Tibet. I didn’t want to write about this Shangri-La-type place that was spiritual and exotic.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I’ve been to Tibet many times. Lhasa is very modern. Half the population is not Tibetan, and many Tibetans work for the state — for example, as police. These young people behave just like other Chinese, with their fake designer jeans and obsession with cars. These guys — they do love their vehicles. So I wanted someone who was not a herder or a farmer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">How much has Tibet changed in one generation? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I started researching Tibet because I was supposed to be producing a movie for Francis Ford Coppola’s studio. I started visiting Tibet in 1992, and it has changed a lot. There are more Chinese than ever from the mainland. The number of Chinese tourists has broken all records, but there are fewer international tourists because it is hard for them to get visas. Sometimes they will let elderly Westerners in in small groups, but the young backpackers are largely gone. The same with foreign NGOs. There are very few left in Tibet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are two graphic scenes in which Champa seems to force himself on women, including both this businesswoman and her daughter. Would you call this rape?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In one case, you have a young girl who is quite unsure of her sexuality, and a young man who did not enjoy doing it. It is really a gray area. While both women did not like it, they did not resist much, either.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I wanted to create sexual relationships that were as complex as possible. It’s a metaphor for Chinese and Tibetan relationships. Tibet and China are engaged in a very complex co-dependency. You should feel uncomfortable reading these passages.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With his Tibetan looks and Tibetan papers, Champa has a hard time finding a place to stay. Would you say that the Chinese were being racist to him?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They’re pragmatic. The hotels want to avoid trouble, and so they overreact. Landlords, too. And the result is not so subtle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The only job Champa can get in Beijing is “security work in a hotel,” which is a euphemism for “thug in a black jail”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">— an extralegal detention center. How common is this practice? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The one thing a Tibetan guy can do in Beijing is be a security guard. In fact, Beijing has held recruiting campaigns for young Lhasa men to do this work in the capital. So Champa goes to work for one of these “hotels.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When the government rounds up petitioners, they are kept in these “hotels” until they can be sent back to their home provinces. There are also “hotels” that the local security officials use for people when they don’t want to press official charges. It’s a non-place.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Champa gets involved with activists trying to save a truckload of dogs headed for the slaughterhouse. Does this really happen?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eating dog is legal in China, and the dog meat restaurants need supplies. But nobody actually rears meat dogs — it’s too expensive — so they just steal them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These incidents really take place. A group of activists will stop a delivery truck with their cars — they have cars because they are generally middle-class. Then they buy up the stock of stolen dogs. I find it encouraging that people are organizing things not related to their immediate interests.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You’ve worked with Greenpeace and local environmental groups. You also predict a dark ecological future in your novels. How bad is the situation in China? Is the damage reversible?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some rivers could still be cleaned up — some, maybe not all. The air quality could be improved if they made an effort to phase out coal. Forestry is almost gone. That’s too late. You can’t replant biodiversity. But the main problem is the underground water — it’s so polluted. This is the most serious crisis: the water supply.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140525ea5p000p2</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_049.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark92">Business/Financial Desk; SECTA</a><a name="bookmark93">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">As Publishers Fight Amazon, Books Vanish</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD and MELISSA EDDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,219 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s power over the publishing and bookselling industries is unrivaled in the modern era. Now it has started wielding its might in a more brazen way than ever before.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seeking ever-higher payments from publishers to bolster its anemic bottom line, Amazon is holding books and authors hostage on two continents by delaying shipments and raising prices. The literary community is fearful and outraged -- and practically begging for government intervention.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;How is this not extortion? You know, the thing that is illegal when the Mafia does it,&#39;&#39; asked Dennis Loy Johnson of Melville House, echoing remarks being made across social media.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is, as usual, staying mum. &#39;&#39;We talk when we have something to say,&#39;&#39; Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder and chief executive, said at the company&#39;s annual meeting this week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The battle is being waged largely over physical books. In the United States, Amazon has been discouraging customers from buying titles from Hachette, the fourth-largest publisher by market share. Late Thursday, it escalated the dispute by making it impossible to order Hachette titles being issued this summer and fall. It is using some of the same tactics against the Bonnier Media Group in Germany.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the real prize is control of e-books, the future of publishing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Publishers tried to rein in Amazon once, and got slapped with a federal antitrust suit for their efforts. Amazon was not directly a party to the case but has reaped the rewards in increased market power. Now it wants to increase its share of the digital proceeds. The publishers, weighing a slide into irrelevance if not nonexistence, are trying to hold the line.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Friday afternoon, Hachette made by far its strongest comment on the conflict.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We are determined to protect the value of our authors&#39; books and our own work in editing, distributing and marketing them,&#39;&#39; said Sophie Cottrell, a Hachette senior vice president. &#39;&#39;We hope this difficult situation will not last a long time, but we are sparing no effort and exploring all options.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Authors Guild accused the retailer of acting illegally.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Amazon clearly has substantial market power and is abusing that market power to maintain and increase its dominance, which likely violates Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act,&#39;&#39; said Jan Constantine, the Guild&#39;s general counsel.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Independent booksellers, meanwhile, announced they could supply Hachette books immediately. The</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">second-largest physical chain, Books-a-Million, advertised 30 percent discounts on select coming Hachette titles. Among the publisher&#39;s imprints are Grand Central Publishing, Orbit and Little, Brown.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is also flexing its muscles in Germany, delaying deliveries of books from Bonnier.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It appears that Amazon is doing exactly that on the German market which it has been doing on the U.S. market: using its dominant position in the market to blackmail the publishers,&#39;&#39; said Alexander Skipis, president of the German Publishers and Booksellers Association.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The association said its antitrust experts were examining whether Amazon&#39;s tactics violated the law.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Of course it is very comfortable for customers to be able to order over the Internet, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,&#39;&#39; Mr. Skipis said. &#39;&#39;But with such an online structure as pursued by Amazon, a book market is being destroyed that has been nurtured over decades and centuries.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Christian Schumacher-Gebler, chief executive for Bonnier in Germany, said the group&#39;s leading publishing houses noticed delays in deliveries of some of its books several weeks ago and confronted the retailer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Amazon confirmed to us that these delays are directly related to the ongoing negotiations over conditions in the electronic book market,&#39;&#39; Mr. Schumacher-Gebler said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer began refusing orders late Thursday for coming Hachette books, including J. K. Rowling&#39;s new novel, published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In some cases, even the web pages promoting the books have disappeared. Anne Rivers Siddons&#39;s new novel, &#39;&#39;The Girls of August,&#39;&#39; coming in July, no longer has a page for the physical book or even the Kindle edition. Only the audio edition is still being sold (for more than $30).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The confrontations with the publishers are the biggest display of Amazon&#39;s dominance since it briefly stripped another publisher, Macmillan, of its &#39;&#39;buy&#39;&#39; buttons in 2010. It seems likely to encourage debate about the concentration of power by the retailer. No firm in American history has exerted the control over the American book market -- physical, digital and secondhand -- that Amazon does.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">James Patterson, one of the country&#39;s best-selling writers, described the confrontation between Amazon and Hachette as &#39;&#39;a war.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Bookstores, libraries, authors, and books themselves are caught in the crossfire of an economic war,&#39;&#39; he wrote on Facebook. &#39;&#39;If this is the new American way, then maybe it has to be changed -- by law, if necessary -- immediately, if not sooner.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Patterson&#39;s novels due to be released this summer and fall are now impossible to buy from Amazon in either print or digital form.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette, which is owned by the French conglomerate Lagardère, was one of the publishers in the antitrust case, which involved e-book prices. But even before that, relations between the retailer and the publisher have been tense. Hachette made the case to Washington regulators in 2009 that Amazon was having a detrimental effect on publishing, but got nowhere.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For several months, Amazon has been quietly discouraging the sales of Hachette&#39;s physical books by several techniques -- cutting the customer&#39;s discount so the book approached list price, taking weeks to ship the book, suggesting that prospective customers buy other books instead and increasing the discount for the Kindle version.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has millions of members in its Prime club, who get fast shipping. This was, as Internet wits quickly called it, the &#39;&#39;UnPrime&#39;&#39; approach.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer&#39;s strategy seems to be to drive a wedge between the writers, who need Amazon sales to survive, and Hachette. But this does not seem to be working the way Amazon might want. Nina Laden, a children&#39;s book writer, was one of many Hachette authors lashing out at Amazon in the last week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I have supported Amazon for as long as Amazon has existed,&#39;&#39; she wrote in a Facebook posting she also sent to the retailer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She went on to say that she was &#39;&#39;frankly shocked and angry at what you are doing&#39;&#39; to her new book, &#39;&#39;Once Upon a Memory.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;It has made me tell my readers to shop elsewhere -- and they are and will,&#39;&#39; she wrote. (Amazon customer service wrote back, saying &#39;&#39;We will be glad to investigate this issue further&#39;&#39; if Ms. Laden would provide additional information.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One of the books made scarce by Amazon&#39;s actions is an updated edition of Brad Stone&#39;s &#39;&#39;The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon.&#39;&#39; The book revealed how Mr. Bezos said Amazon should approach vulnerable publishers &#39;&#39;the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;What irony,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Stone, a former reporter for The New York Times. &#39;&#39;A book detailing Amazon&#39;s heavy-handed tactics in business negotiations becomes, at least in a small way, a victim of those tactics.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">On Friday, a new edition of Brad Stone&#39;s &#39;&#39;The Everything Store&#39;&#39; was listed as &#39;&#39;unavailable.&#39;&#39; (B2) Document NYTF000020140527ea5o0000m</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_050.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark94">finance</a><a name="bookmark95">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon ups ante in battle with publishers; Online giant increases pressure on Hachette and Germany’s Bonnier</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD and MELISSA EDDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">700 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, under fire in much of the literary community for energetically discouraging customers from buying books from the publisher Hachette, has abruptly escalated the battle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer began refusing orders late Thursday for coming Hachette books, including J.K.

Anne Rivers Siddons’s new novel, ‘‘The Girls of August,’’ coming in July, no longer has a page for the physical book or even the Kindle edition. Only the audio edition is still being sold (for more than $60). Otherwise it is as if it did not exist.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is also flexing its muscles in Germany, delaying deliveries of books issued by the German division of the Bonnier Media Group, a major publisher.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It appears that Amazon is doing exactly that on the German market which it has been doing on the U.S. market: using its dominant position in the market to blackmail the publishers,’’ said Alexander Skipis, president of the German Publishers and Booksellers Association.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The association said its antitrust experts were examining whether Amazon’s tactics were illegal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Of course it is very comfortable for customers to be able to order over the Internet, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,’’ Mr. Skipis said. ‘‘But with such an online structure as pursued by Amazon, a book market is being destroyed that has been nurtured over decades and centuries.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The confrontations with the publishers are the biggest display of Amazon’s dominance since it briefly stripped another publisher, Macmillan, of its ‘‘buy’’ buttons in 2010. It seems likely to encourage debate about the enormous power the company wields.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment. A Hachette spokeswoman did not return a message for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Christian Schumacher-Gebler, chief executive for Bonnier in Germany, said the group’s leading publishing houses noticed delays in deliveries of some of its books several weeks ago and confronted the company about it. ‘‘Amazon confirmed to us that these delays are directly related to the ongoing negotiations over conditions in the electronic book market,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which is under immense pressure from Wall Street to improve its profit margins, is trying to get better terms on e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer controls an increasing share of the digital book market in the United States in the wake of the Justice Department’s successful pursuit of most of the major New York publishers on antitrust violations having to do with the pricing of e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For several months, Amazon has been quietly discouraging the sales of Hachette’s physical books by several techniques — cutting the customer’s discount so the book approaches list price; taking weeks to ship the book; suggesting that prospective customers buy other books instead; and increasing the discount for the Kindle version.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer’s strategy seems to be to drive a wedge between the writers, who need their sales at Amazon to survive, and Hachette. But this does not seem to be working quite the way Amazon wants. Nina Laden, a Hachette children’s book author, lashed out at Amazon this week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I have supported Amazon for as long as Amazon has existed.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The biggest test yet of American investors’ appetite for a Chinese Internet company has passed with flying colors</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">— and it doesn’t involve the Alibaba Group, China’s e-commerce giant.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instead, JD.com, an online retailer aspiring to become China’s answer to Amazon.com, exceeded expectations for its initial public offering on Wednesday, raising $1.78 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even though the company has lost money for the last several years, the stock sale valued the company at $25.7 billion, a valuation even higher than Twitter’s at its market debut last fall.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The warm reception for JD.com reflects investor hunger for a wave of fast-growing Chinese companies that are going public in the United States to stake their claims as global technology powers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The biggest of these budding titans remains Alibaba, something of an amalgam of eBay, Amazon and Google, whose astounding growth has inflated expectations for its coming I.P.O. Analysts have speculated that Alibaba may be worth as much as $200 billion when it finally goes public, more than the value of Facebook or Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These Chinese companies have drawn intense interest because they offer shareholders a way to tap China’s enormous growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘They’re basically directional bets on the Chinese consumer economy,’’ said Rett Wallace, the chief executive and a co-founder of Triton Research.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">JD.com, however, is coming to market at a time when the once-torrid pace of technology I.P.O.s has slowed significantly amid concerns over high valuations. Some once-hot stocks, like the security firm FireEye, are trading below their offering prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the allure of a fast-growing Chinese Internet company appears to have proved powerful: The offer was 15 times oversubscribed, according to a person briefed on the matter. Shares in JD.com rose sharply after they began trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday, and were up 10.2 percent at $20.94 near midday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">By many measures, JD.com is not nearly as big as Alibaba, whether by revenue or market value. But the retailer, whose backers include the Chinese mobile software giant Tencent, has established itself as a significant force in its home market on the back of its expansive online shopping empire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">JD.com, which began as a seller of electronics, now claims to be the biggest direct seller to Chinese consumers, with $20.7 billion worth of goods sold to customers last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Much of the company’s appeal lies in the relatively unconquered Chinese e-commerce market. In its prospectus, JD.com noted that less than 50 percent of the country’s population was online. And online shopping is expected to grow about 27 percent each year, according to the iResearch Consulting Group.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though many investors have directly compared JD.com to Alibaba, the two operate differently. JD.com maintains a significant amount of product inventory and owns much of its shipping and logistics network, a business model that many have likened to Amazon’s core business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But Alibaba serves primarily as a middleman between customers and sellers, akin to parts of eBay and Amazon. Alibaba’s is a much less expensive operating model that gives the company its eye-popping margins: Operating</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">profits in the first nine months of its 2013 fiscal year amounted to 48 percent of revenue, a ratio that is the envy of Silicon Valley giants.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By contrast, JD.com has reported a loss for each of the last five years, even as its sales have ballooned. Last year, for instance, the company lost $8 million, despite racking up $11.5 billion in sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has reinvested significantly in its operations, following Amazon’s example and betting that investors will give it the same sort of leeway that they allow the American retailer. Among its biggest costs has been investing in a delivery network that offers same-day delivery in 43 Chinese cities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Running such an operation is likely to be costly over time, though the company has argued that it reaps other benefits from that spending.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It really has been able to control the customer experience,’’ said Kelland Willis, an analyst at Forrester Research.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">JD.com also benefits from its association with Tencent, an Internet software company often considered the biggest rival to Alibaba. Tencent purchased a 15 percent stake in JD.com this spring, and it formally acquired an additional 5 percent on Wednesday in a transaction tied to the I.P.O.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The tie-up had benefits for both sides. JD.com took over much of Tencent’s e-commerce operations. It also gained access to something that may be even more valuable down the road: WeChat, the enormously popular messaging service that Tencent runs, which claims about 400 million monthly active users.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Already, about 18 percent of JD.com’s orders come via mobile devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘They’re integrated into the biggest messaging app in China,’’ Ms. Willis said. ‘‘It does give them an advantage.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">JD.com’s offering also will bestow wealth — both realized and on paper — on its existing investors. The biggest is the company’s founder and chief executive, Richard Qiangdong Liu, who will sell shares in the I.P.O. but will still control billions of dollars’ worth of its stock.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other big winners are Western investors including Tiger Global Management, an investment firm, and DST Global, the Russian investment group. Both are also expected to keep multibillion-dollar stakes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While those investors will benefit from the eagerness of newcomers, analysts have raised concerns about parts of JD.com’s structure, among them the unusual power the company’s founder will have. Thanks to his ownership of a second, much more powerful class of stock, Mr. Liu will continue to exert an enormous amount of control, wielding an effective 84 percent of the retailer’s voting power.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And analysts have questioned whether JD.com will be able to build itself into a colossus like Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘There’s so much suspension of belief by Americans investing in these companies,’’ Mr. Wallace of Triton said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, he added, ‘‘This is just one of a handful of companies that have some scale and staying power in that market.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140522ea5n0006u</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_052.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark98">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark99">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s Tactics Confirm Its Critics’ Worst Suspicions</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By FARHAD MANJOO</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">564 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

Amazon has also invested heavily in publishing new authors and it has pushed exciting new formats made possible by electronic distribution.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet the literary community has always greeted Amazon’s moves with suspicion. The fear is mostly about the future. What will happen to books when Amazon controls the entire industry? How will authors and publishing houses reckon with Amazon’s unchecked power?</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/amazon-escalates-its-battle-against-hachette/?ref=technology" class="s1" target="_blank">This week, as part of a contract dispute with the publisher Hachette, </a>we’re seeing Amazon behaving at its worst<span class="p">. The company’s willingness to nakedly flex its anticompetitive muscle gives new cause for concern to anyone who cares about books — authors, publishers, but mainly customers.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here’s the back story: In an effort to exert pressure on Hachette, Amazon began taking down preorder buttons for many Hachette titles. It has also suddenly raised prices on some Hachette books and has changed its page design to more prominently recommend other titles. These moves follow weeks of increasingly hardball tactics.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among other customer-punishing moves, Amazon has increased shipping times for Hachette titles from a few days to weeks.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/12/independent_bookstores_vs_amazon_buying_books_online_is_better_for_authors_better_for_the_economy_and_better_for_you_.html" class="s1" target="_blank">For years, Amazon’s drive for cheaper prices has been good for consumers, and </a>arguably for literary culture<span class="p">, too. When books are cheaper and more widely accessible, more people can read them — and there’s nothing better for literary culture than people owning and reading books.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Physical bookstores sell books at a huge markup, which necessarily reduces the number of books that people can afford to buy. Amazon sells printed books, e-books and audiobooks for much, much less. Anyone who has used Amazon’s services has noticed how that fact changes one’s attitude toward books. Through its Prime program, through the Kindle, and through its audiobook subsidiary Audible, Amazon has made it possible to buy books on impulse.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just wait, the company’s critics have always shot back. Wait till Amazon controls the whole market — then see how well it treats authors, publishers and customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now Amazon is walking right into its detractors’ predictions. There are a couple obvious reasons this is a bad strategy. It’s bad public relations — if it doesn’t already, Amazon may soon control a monopolistic stake of the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-book market and its tactics are sure to invite not only scorn from the book industry but also increased regulatory oversight.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But the more basic problem here is that Amazon is violating its own code. To win a corporate battle, Amazon is ruining its customer experience. Mr. Bezos has long pointed to customer satisfaction as his North Star; making sure customers are treated well is the guiding principle for how he runs Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now Amazon is raising prices, removing ordering buttons, lengthening shipping times and monkeying with recommendation algorithms. Do these sound like the moves of a man who cares about customers above all else?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140523ea5n003s5</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_053.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark100">ArtsBeat Arts</a><a name="bookmark101">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Unveils Children’s Show</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MIKE HALE</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">199 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

To a more disinterested observer, it seems pleasant enough, with a soothing pace and shipboard and forest settings and other visual effects that are richer and deeper than the television norm.

At that price, shareholders valued the company at more than $28.6 billion, more than other United States technology names like Twitter and LinkedIn.

Alibaba filed to go public in the United States earlier this month, though it has not yet publicly provided details about how much it will raise and where it will list. What’s more, JD.com achieved a rich price </a>despite poor governance<span class="p">, another good sign for Alibaba, which is also hoping to sell an unusual governance structure to investors in its own I.P.O.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Compared with Alibaba, JD.com is smaller by revenue and valuation. Like Amazon, JD.com says that it is most focused on its customers’ experience and has poured its profits into reinvestments in operations, particularly its delivery services. As a result, the Chinese company has reported net losses for the last five years.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/from-virginia-chasing-down-credit-suisse" class="s1" target="_blank">CREDIT SUISSE’S UNLIKELY FOE | “Hundreds of miles from Credit Suisse’s Madison Avenue office tower and an ocean away from its headquarters in Zurich, the bank found an unlikely opponent in Alexandria, Va.,” </a>DealBook’s Ben Protess writes<span class="p">. There, federal prosecutors helped lead an investigation into the Swiss bank, which this week pleaded guilty to helping thousands of United States clients hide their wealth overseas.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Never mind that Credit Suisse has no offices in Virginia, Mr. Protess writes, adding, “Prosecutors at the United States attorney’s office in Alexandria, working with the Justice Department’s tax division in Washington, had all the jurisdiction they wanted: A lone Credit Suisse client, on a single day eight years ago, flew out of Dulles International Airport in Virginia on his way to Zurich.” The tactic demonstrated the long arm of prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia, who have prosecuted a number of banks and other financial players scattered across the country and the globe.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under Neil H. MacBride, who led the attorney’s office until recently, Virginia prosecutors filed some of the few criminal cases stemming from the 2008 financial crisis, though against regional companies rather than big Wall Street players. Headline-grabbing financial cases typically belong to Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, but prosecutors in Virginia have a few tactical advantages. For one, the office ranks as the quickest federal court district in the country in terms of the time it takes for a case to go to trial.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/barclays-fined-43-9-million-in-setting-price-of-gold" class="s1" target="_blank">BARCLAYS FINED | Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority has fined Barclays $43.9 million after it accused a former trader at the British lender of improperly influencing gold prices at the expense of a customer, </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/barclays-fined-43-9-million-in-setting-price-of-gold" class="a" target="_blank">DealBook’s</a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/barclays-fined-43-9-million-in-setting-price-of-gold" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/barclays-fined-43-9-million-in-setting-price-of-gold" class="a" target="_blank">Chad Bray writes</a>. The regulator said it issued the fine because Barclays failed to adequately manage conflicts of interest between the bank and its customers and for a failure in its internal controls. The failures occurred from 2004 to 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The F.C.A. also fined Daniel James Plunkett, a former Barclays trader, 95,600 pounds and barred him from participating in any regulated financial activity. The F.C.A. said Mr. Plunkett, who settled with the regulator, profited at the expense of a customer. Mr. Plunkett’s improper conduct occurred a day after the F.C.A. and the United States authorities announced a $450 million fine against Barclays for improperly influencing global benchmark interest rates, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Barclays fine comes as the F.C.A. has been examining whether the gold fixing process complies with new international standards put in place for benchmarks in light of the Libor scandal. The fine is the latest black eye for Barclays, which has struggled to rebuild its reputation since it became the first bank to admit to wrongdoing in the Libor scandal two years ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ON THE AGENDA | Data on new home sales for April is out at 10 a.m. Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, is on CNBC at 9 a.m. Frank Keating, the chief executive of the American Bankers Association, is on Bloomberg TV at 2:20 p.m.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In honor of Memorial Day, there will be no DealBook newsletter on Monday.

A partnership vote had been set for this weekend to finalize the Patton Boggs merger with Squire Sanders, an international firm founded in Ohio. But the vote is said to have been suspended.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The suspension came after a motion was filed on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan to block a settlement between Patton Boggs and the Chevron Corporation, Ms. Olson writes. The settlement required Patton Boggs to withdraw from representing clients in Ecuador who were seeking to collect a $9.5 billion verdict against Chevron that their principal lawyer, Steven R. Donziger, had won in an Ecuador court. As a result of the settlement, Patton Boggs forfeited millions in fees and paid Chevron $15 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In legal papers, Mr. Donziger called Patton Boggs’s actions “unprecedented” and a “flagrant” ethical violation. Patton Boggs agreed to the deal with Chevron to “pave the way for a merger with another law firm,” he wrote, which made the violations “all the more troubling.” Patton Boggs has been seeking a merger partner for some months but has been haunted by its work for the Ecuadorean clients.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="https://twitter.com/melbournecoal" class="s1" target="_blank">| Contact: </a><a href="https://twitter.com/melbournecoal" class="a" target="_blank">@melbournecoal</a> <a href="mailto:sydney.ember@nytimes.com" class="s1" target="_blank">| </a><a href="mailto:sydney.ember@nytimes.com" target="_blank">E-mail</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: justify;">Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter<a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/category/mergers-acquisitions/" class="s1" target="_blank">, delivered every morning and afternoon. </a><a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/category/mergers-acquisitions/" target="_blank">Mergers &amp; Acquisitions »</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Boeing Agrees to Acquire British Aviation Software Firm | ETS Aviation, based in Bristol, England, provides software to more than 120 airlines and corporate flight departments, Boeing said.

Moritz said as he entered a Whole Foods store in San Francisco one recent afternoon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Moritz, the chairman of the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and a recipient of a British knighthood last year, was wearing a bright green T-shirt bearing a logo for Instacart, a two-year-old grocery delivery start-up that Sequoia has invested in. He was here to show me what it’s like to work for the start-up — in particular, how unexpectedly difficult it is to quickly and accurately buy and deliver an assortment of groceries for a stranger.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.instacart.com/" class="a" target="_blank">Instacart</a> <span style=" color: #000;">might not sound like a novel service. It is one of several companies that is trying to revive a dream first floated, and then shelved, during the last dot-com boom — the dream of ordering your staples online and having them show up at your door a short while later. At least a half-dozen firms offer grocery delivery across the country, including Amazon.com’s AmazonFresh, FreshDirect, Peapod and services run by big grocery chains.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/technology/rough-patch-for-uber-services-challenge-to-taxis.html?_r=0" class="s1" target="_blank">But behind the scenes, Instacart is unusual and intriguing. It operates according to a decentralized business model that borrows from services like Uber, Airbnb and other firms in the </a>so-called sharing economy<span class="p">. And it is not only potentially lucrative, but also could redefine how we think about the future of labor.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you buy groceries from Instacart, the company summons a green-shirted “personal shopper” through the firm’s smartphone app. The shopper receives your list, scurries through a grocery store to pick up your items and then heads across town in his own car to deliver your stuff.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics4_445100.htm#00-0000" class="s1" target="_blank">Instacart’s shoppers earn from $15 to $30 an hour, depending on how quickly they deliver people’s food. That’s quite a high wage considering the job does not require a college degree, is part time and can be done during flexible hours. It’s substantially more than the typical supermarket worker salary of about </a><a href="http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics4_445100.htm#00-0000" class="a" target="_blank">$9 to $11 per hour</a> <span style=" color: #000;">— though of course without any benefits like health insurance. The workers are independent contractors, responsible for paying for expenses like their own Social Security taxes.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, Instacart’s success suggests that rather than simply automate workers out of their jobs, technology might create new labor opportunities for people who haven’t acquired formal credentials or skills in an economy where low- and medium-skilled workers face a bleak outlook. Like the ride-sharing service Uber, Instacart creates work by connecting affluent customers who have more money than time with part-time workers who have the opposite problem — lots of time, not enough money.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/business/companies-built-on-sharing-balk-when-it-comes-to-regulators.html" class="s1" target="_blank">But unlike ride-sharing or apartment rental services, Instacart isn’t intruding upon a regulated industry, and its service poses little risk to its customers’ health or property, so it faces few of </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/business/companies-built-on-sharing-balk-when-it-comes-to-regulators.html" class="a" target="_blank">the complications that have dogged</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/business/companies-built-on-sharing-balk-when-it-comes-to-regulators.html" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/business/companies-built-on-sharing-balk-when-it-comes-to-regulators.html" class="a" target="_blank">other sharing companies</a>. Because it expands the customer base for physical stores, it has also been welcomed by some grocery chains as a potential bulwark against the wider roll-out of Amazon’s delivery service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“When you ask what kind of niches we’ll see for people who used to be in traditional middle-class jobs, this is the kind of labor that could fit into that,” said Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University whose book “Average Is Over” contemplates how technology is altering labor markets. “I wouldn’t want to suggest people will become grocery-delivery millionaires,” he said, “but if you don’t have a college education but you’re smart and responsible, could you make a living doing this and maybe piecing it together with some of these other kinds of jobs? Absolutely.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instacart was founded in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, now 27, an engineer who spent two years working at Amazon.com. “I had this problem of never having groceries in my fridge and never having the motivation and energy to go to the store,” Mr. Mehta said. But he found most grocery services, including AmazonFresh, too cumbersome. They required him to submit his order many hours in advance of delivery, and they sometimes didn’t offer the merchandise he was used to getting at his local store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What’s more, traditional grocery delivery services are costly to set up, requiring warehouses to store perishable food, a fleet of custom-painted trucks for delivery and a staff of full- or part-time workers to package and deliver the orders. “We were the clowns who invested in WebVan, and we are only just getting out of therapy from that,” Mr. Moritz said, referring to the first boom’s spectacular grocery flameout.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instacart does not maintain warehouses or trucks. Instead, the service is assembled out of found parts — existing supermarkets, willing part-time workers and their cars. The model has many advantages. It creates vast selection for customers by allowing them to shop at many different stores, from large chains to specialty shops like San Francisco’s worker-owned, vegan-friendly Rainbow Co-Op. It allows for extremely quick delivery too, including an option that will deliver your groceries in under an hour.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though he declined to provide specifics, Mr. Mehta also said the firm had turned a profit in certain markets. Instacart now operates in 10 cities, including New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Austin, Seattle and Los Angeles, and plans to be in 17 by the end of the year. It has 50 full-time employees and more than 1,000 independent shoppers under contract, many of whom fall into two demographic groups: college students and middle-aged mothers looking for flexible work.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite its low-cost business model, Instacart isn’t cheap. The service charges a delivery fee of $3.99 for most orders, and it also makes money by marking up store prices. The amounts vary depending on the item, but I noticed Instacart’s prices coming in at about 20 percent more than I could find at my local store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The markup explains in part how Instacart can afford to pay shoppers such high wages. But as I discovered as I shopped with Mr. Moritz, there’s another factor behind high pay: Shopping is a skill, and Instacart pays handsomely to get people who are very good at it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though he could talk at length about the virtues of Instacart’s business, Mr. Moritz is a billionaire investor, but he turned out to be a poor shopper. As we walked through Whole Foods, he often needed my help to locate a customer’s items. I had to show him where to find grapes, bananas and Perrier; neither of us had any luck finding Babybel cheese.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A few days later, I went on another delivery with Sharon Schedler, a 43-year-old mother who has been working for Instacart for about a year. She was a pro. Despite my peppering her with questions, she completed an 11-item order in under 10 minutes, including giving the customer a call to suggest substituting chicken breasts for chicken tenders, which were out of stock. Ms. Schedler was also meticulous about picking produce. “I try to be pickier than I would be for myself,” she said as she studied zucchinis for nicks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lawrence F. Katz, an economist at Harvard who studies technology and labor, offered a few reasons to stifle excessive optimism about Instacart’s model. First, technology may yet one day render Instacart’s shoppers obsolete. Drones could pick our groceries, after all.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another possibility, he said, is that wages will be bid down as more people compete to become Instacart shoppers. Or, as the company’s software becomes more sophisticated, it could squeeze more efficiency out of workers; they may end up doing more work and not earn any more money for it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A third problem is the lack of job security and benefits, which were once considered standard features of middle-class jobs. But Mr. Mehta says he doesn’t see that shifting. “The advantage to this model is that you</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">choose your own hours,” he said. More corporate control over work habits “is something that would drive a lot of people away. The independent contractor model — I’m not sure that’s going to change.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Correction: May 21, 2014, Wednesday</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this column provided an outdated number of cities in which Instacart, a grocery delivery start-up, operates.

Just last year, in perhaps one final assertion of its dwindling powers, B&amp;N stocked fewer Simon &amp; Schuster books because it felt the publisher </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/books/barnes-noble-simon-schuster-dispute-said-to-hurt-sales.html?_r=0" class="a" target="_blank">was not doing enough</a> <span style=" color: #000;">to “support” the chain.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two things make Amazon’s confrontational stance toward Hachette unusual. First, there is the overwhelming power Amazon has in the marketplace. I usually write that it controls a third of the American book business — new, used and e-books — although other estimates put it as high as half. Barnes &amp; Noble at its peak had to be mindful of Borders, whose stores were just a short drive away. But Amazon has blown away its online competition.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The other unusual thing is Amazon’s multifaceted approach. Most of the time, it has all sorts of ways to encourage you to buy a book: faster shipping, cheaper shipping, a discount, a cheap copy from a third party who was cleaning out his closet. Now, like a river reversing its flow, it is using all sorts of ways to get people not to buy Hachette titles: more expensive, slower shipping, pitching something else instead.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/28602.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Affected are not only popular authors like Michael Connelly and celebrities like the Yankees’ Mariano Rivera </a><a href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/28602.html" class="a" target="_blank">but</a><a href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/28602.html" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/28602.html" class="a" target="_blank">also specialist lines</a><a href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/28602.html" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/28602.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Hachette either owns (Yen Press, a manga line) or distributes (Marvel Comics).</a></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/Off-Topic/Amazon-vs-Hachette/td-p/43549684" class="s1" target="_blank">“You can really ruin authors and companies financially by doing this,” wrote a commentator </a><a href="http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/Off-Topic/Amazon-vs-Hachette/td-p/43549684" class="a" target="_blank">on a gaming site</a> <span style=" color: #000;">. “Heck the manga will take quite a beating. Manga is rather niche, and Amazon is one of the main places you can find it.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The worry for Hachette is that its authors will rise up in anger at the publisher, forcing it to surrender to Amazon’s terms. The worry for Amazon is that it will be perceived of as a thug. If the 4,000 tweets on my two stories on the topic late last week are anything to go by, Amazon might need to worry more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://t.co/dwmyaz8j2u" class="s1" target="_blank">He’s looking at you, Amazon. </a><a href="http://t.co/h2AFy3h1QI" class="a" target="_blank">http://t.co/dwmyaz8j2u </a><a href="http://t.co/h2AFy3h1QI" target="_blank">http://t.co/h2AFy3h1QI</a></p><ul id="l4"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://twitter.com/JamieFord/status/465203979358449664" class="a" target="_blank">Jamie Ford (@JamieFord) 10 May </a><a href="https://twitter.com/JamieFord/status/465203979358449664" target="_blank">14</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette authors seem outraged at Amazon, not Hachette:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://t.co/dtUhVakSY8" class="s1" target="_blank">God, how I hate Amazon, now more than ever, as they screw my book.

Hugh C. Howey, who self-published his novel “Wool” through Amazon and then sold the rights to Simon &amp; Schuster for a physical edition, said Amazon was being held to a different standard than independent bookstores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.hughhowey.com/amazon-and-hachette-go-to-war/" class="s1" target="_blank">“When bookstores refuse to carry Amazon-published books, they are celebrated as champions,” he said </a><a href="http://www.hughhowey.com/amazon-and-hachette-go-to-war/" class="a" target="_blank">in an</a><a href="http://www.hughhowey.com/amazon-and-hachette-go-to-war/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.hughhowey.com/amazon-and-hachette-go-to-war/" class="a" target="_blank">article on his website</a><a href="http://www.hughhowey.com/amazon-and-hachette-go-to-war/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a>titled “Amazon and Hachette Go to War.” He’s also upset that Barnes &amp; Noble, in its spat with Simon &amp; Schuster last year, made it all but impossible to find “Wool” at its stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is, however, a big difference between those earlier incidents and what is happening now. Independent bookstores broke with tradition in 2012 and decided not to sell books published by Amazon. That was their choice. And if customers chose as a result not to shop there, that was their choice. It’s a free country.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon is not saying it is dropping all Hachette books. Instead, it’s as if Barnes &amp; Noble had run ads for Mr. Howey’s “Wool” last spring and then, when an eager customer came in to buy it, said there were no copies available but how about a copy of Philip K. Dick’s “The Penultimate Truth” — another dystopia about a community living underground — instead?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That sounds like bait and switch, something the Federal Trade Commission frowns on as deceptive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Say, for example, you have lunch with a friend and he tells you he’s reading this great book by Sherman Alexie, “The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.” So after lunch you go back to your desk and type on Google, “How can I buy Alexie Diary” (without quotes).</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Absolutely-True-Diary-Part-Time-Indian/dp/0316013692" class="s1" target="_blank">The first result that pops up is Amazon. But Amazon says </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Absolutely-True-Diary-Part-Time-Indian/dp/0316013692" class="a" target="_blank">it might be a month</a> <span style=" color: #000;">before the book, published by Hachette’s Little, Brown Books for Young Readers line, shows up on your doorstep.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/07132327193/amazon-taunting-antitrust-regulators-screwing-over-customers-who-want-books-hachette.shtml" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon wants to have it both ways, telling customers it has the book while discouraging them from buying it. This is why some Internet commentators are saying </a><a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ftc-policy-statement-on-deception" class="a" target="_blank">the real issue here is deception </a>as defined by the FTC<span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">– “a representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumer’s detriment.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon seems confident the uproar will soon die down and it will get what it wants.

All Rights Reserved. The world’s biggest bookstore is a bit smaller these days.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s secret campaign to discourage customers from buying books by the French publisher Hachette burst into the open on Friday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The uneasy relationship between the retailer and the writing community, which needs Amazon but fears its power, immediately soured, as authors took to Twitter to denounce what they saw as bullying.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Among Amazon’s tactics against Hachette, some of which it has been employing for months, are charging more for its books and suggesting that readers might enjoy instead a book from another author. If customers for some reason persist and buy a Hachette book anyway, Amazon is saying it will take weeks to deliver it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The scorched-earth tactics arose out of failed contract negotiations. Amazon was seeking better terms, Hachette was balking, so Amazon began cutting it off. Writers such as Malcolm Gladwell and J.D. Salinger are affected, although some Hachette authors are unscathed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On both sides, the stakes are high. Amazon controls about a third of the book business, which means big publishers cannot live without it. But Amazon risks alienating readers as well as authors, and undermining its carefully wrought image as the consumer’s friend.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘What we are seeing is a classic case of muscle-flexing,’’ said Andrew Rhomberg, founder of Jellybooks, an e-book discovery site. ‘‘Kind of like Vladimir Putin mobilizing his troops along the Ukrainian border.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As accusations flew, the two antagonists kept a low profile. Hachette emphasized that it was shipping orders promptly and yet Amazon was still showing the books as being unavailable. Amazon, as usual, declined to say anything at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer appeared to be using three main tactics in its efforts against Hachette, which owns Grand Central Publishing; Orbit; and Little, Brown, as well as many other American imprints.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One is simply warning that books will take a long time to show up. Amazon has been relentlessly expanding its delivery ambitions and just this week announced Sunday deliveries in the United States in 15 more cities, including Austin, Tex., and New Orleans. Its two-day free shipping program has more than 20 million members.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But if a reader wants a Malcolm Gladwell book from Amazon, ‘‘Outliers,’’ ‘‘The Tipping Point,’’ ‘‘Blink’’ and ‘‘What the Dog Saw’’ were all listed as taking two to three weeks. A Spanish edition from another publisher was available immediately.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then there is the question of price. ‘‘Outliers’’ was selling Friday for $15.29, a mere 10 percent discount. On Barnes &amp; Noble, the book was $12.74.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With some Hachette authors, Amazon seemed to be discouraging buyers in other ways. On the top of the page for Jeffery Deaver’s forthcoming novel ‘‘The Skin Collector,’’ Amazon suggested that the prospective customer buy other novels entirely.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Similar items at a lower price,’’ it said, were novels by Lee Child and John Sandford.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette authors were fuming.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Like all repressive regimes, Amazon wants to completely control your access to books,’’ Sherman Alexie said in a Twitter post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Given AMZN’s near-monopoly position I think it’s an antitrust violation, but the U.S. antitrust regulators are broken,’’ Charlie Stross said, also on Twitter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With the demise of the Borders chain, the struggles of Barnes &amp; Noble, and the ever-precarious position of the few remaining independent stores, authors of all types have grown to depend on Amazon. The Hachette author Marla Heller, who wrote ‘‘The Dash Diet Weight Loss Solution,’’ said Amazon’s actions ‘‘dramatically impacted’’ her sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On March 19, she said, Amazon raised the price of her book by $8. Then it ran a banner recommending other less expensive diet books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Then they let my book go out of stock,’’ she wrote in an email. ‘‘When this problem started, my book was ranked in the top 300 on Amazon. It has since dropped to as low as the top 3,000. While this may be a dispute between an Internet giant and a major publisher, it is the authors who will pay the price.’’ She included a chart of her sales, which were flat.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman did not respond to a message about Ms. Heller’s complaints. Her book is listed as available with a two- to three-week delay. The discount is 10 percent. The banner promoting other books, however, had disappeared, at least for the moment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Authors Guild said it had received about 15 complaints Friday from Hachette authors involving more than 150 titles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘If you’re a monopolist, you get to be a bully,’’ said Richard Russo, the Pulitzer-winning novelist and Authors Guild vice president. ‘‘Maybe you feel immune.’’ Still, he added that he was surprised that Amazon ‘‘would want one more bad story about its practices.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Michael J. Sullivan is not sure whom to blame. When the science fiction writer saw in March that his books were suddenly unavailable, he called Amazon, which said Hachette was not shipping the books. Hachette told Mr.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sullivan it was. He does not know whom to believe but knows this: ‘‘It’s the little guys who pay the price.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon stopped discounting his novels entirely two months ago. ‘‘To me, this is even worse than the slow shipping aspect,’’ Mr. Sullivan said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Amazon was founded in the mid-1990s, publishers celebrated it as a counterweight to the chain stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘One of the main reasons for doing deals with Amazon in the beginning was because its terms were favorable,’’ said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester. ‘‘They didn’t demand all the concessions that their traditional retail partners asked for. But almost all of those companies, as their relationship with Amazon matured, started to get requests for better terms.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For at least a decade, Amazon has been very aggressive toward publishers. One publisher, who declined to be identified because of fear of Amazon, said negotiations with the company resembled a chef deboning a chicken</p><ul id="l5"><li><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">by the end, everything of value had been sliced off.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One reason for Amazon to pursue Hachette and other suppliers is that the mood on Wall Street is changing. For years, Amazon’s investing all its profits in new businesses was applauded. Revenue soared, and so did the stock.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But shares are down sharply this year and analysts are cutting earnings forecasts. The pending stock exchange debut of Alibaba, the highly profitable Chinese e-commerce company, has underlined the notion that Internet retail does not have to be a break-even game.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Amazon needs to improve its bottom line, it is a dangerous game to make things harder for its customers. Ms. Mulpuru said Amazon was usually cleverer than that. ‘‘This could seem like they’re being spiteful and petty,’’ she said. ‘‘That’s typically not Amazon’s playbook.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140511ea5c0000o</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_059.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark112">B</a><a name="bookmark113">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">WRITERS FEEL AN AMAZON-HACHETTE SPAT</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">81 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">10 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

Many e-commerce companies – led by Amazon.com and the sites it owns, like Diapers.com and Soap.com – have made it easy to order even items like toilet paper and diapers without paying a cent for shipping.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://news.van.fedex.com/fedex-announces-pricing-changes" class="s1" target="_blank">So when FedEx</a><a href="http://news.van.fedex.com/fedex-announces-pricing-changes" class="a" target="_blank">announced last week</a> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304655304579547632772245734" class="s1" target="_blank">that it would change its shipping prices to charge for the space a package occupies in a truck, not just its weight, many </a><a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304655304579547632772245734" class="a" target="_blank">analysts suggested</a> <span style=" color: #000;">that Amazon would be the biggest victim.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/technology/sales-are-colossal-shares-are-soaring-all-amazoncom-is-missing-is-a-profit.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Shipping costs already eat into </a>its slim profits<span class="p">, and as any Internet shopper knows, Amazon has a habit of mailing items from a single order in multiple oversize boxes, often with free two-day shipping.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/16/business/some-shoppers-rebel-against-giant-web-retailers.html" class="s1" target="_blank">But FedEx needs Amazon more than Amazon needs FedEx. Instead, FedEx’s price increase – which happens in January and which analysts say U.P.S. is likely to match — could further cement Amazon’s power over retailing by striking a bigger blow to small Internet retailers, the same ones that are already </a>losing the battle with Amazon<span class="p">. The Internet might have made it possible for the smallest of businesses to sell their wares, but the price of delivering cardboard boxes highlights just how powerful an advantage size can be in the Internet economy.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The main reason is that standard shipping rates simply do not apply to Amazon. The company negotiates its own rates with FedEx and other shipping companies, and gets an enviable deal because of the huge volume of business it supplies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Put another way: FedEx would rather give Amazon a sizeable discount than lose Amazon as a customer altogether.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.shoprunner.com/non_member/home/" class="s1" target="_blank">“The big guys always do better whenever there’s a change because they can bring clout to the negotiations,” said Fiona Dias, chief strategy officer at </a>ShopRunner<span class="p">, an e-commerce service that offers free shipping at a variety of retailers. “Little retailers don’t have that clout.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The web operation of your local book or shoe store also gets retailer discounts from shipping companies, but they are not as deep.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.singer22.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">Jon Singer, founder and chief executive of </a>Singer22<span class="p">, a retail store and e-commerce site based in Long Island, said he might try to fit more items into smaller boxes if U.P.S., his shipping service, also changed pricing, but he would not start charging shoppers more for shipping. Ultimately, he said, “We’re going to have to eat it.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smaller boxes would probably be a relief to people who care about the environment or just want more space in their recycling bins. But for small online retailers, it is actually another added expense because they have to buy more sizes of box. Now they generally buy only a few.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“You’re going to have to weigh shipping air across the country and paying extra for that, or buying more custom-fitted boxes and paying extra because you have all these size of boxes sitting around,” Ms. Dias said.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201117850" class="s1" target="_blank">And FedEx has added incentive to maintain its side of the deal with Amazon, because Amazon has already signaled to FedEx and the other delivery companies that it doesn’t necessarily need them as much as it once did.

D. Salinger and other popular writers, a flexing of its muscle as a battle with a publisher spills into the open.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Internet retailer, which controls more than a third of the book trade in the United States, is marking many books published by Hachette Book Group as not available for at least two or three weeks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Hachette spokeswoman said on Thursday that the publisher was striving to keep Amazon supplied but that the Internet giant was delaying shipments &#39;&#39;for reasons of their own.&#39;&#39; Hachette is one of the largest New York houses, publishing under the Little, Brown and Grand Central imprints, among many others.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The affected books are a mixture of new and old. A just-published memoir, &#39;&#39;Everybody&#39;s Got Something,&#39;&#39; by the &#39;&#39;Good Morning America&#39;&#39; anchor Robin Roberts, is taking as long as three weeks to ship, customers were told. So is Stephen Colbert&#39;s &#39;&#39;America Again: Re-becoming the Greatness We Never Weren&#39;t.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">James Patterson&#39;s &#39;&#39;Alex Cross, Run&#39;&#39; published at the end of February, is taking as much as five weeks. &#39;&#39;NYPD Red,&#39;&#39; by Mr. Patterson and Marshall Karp, will take as much as three weeks. Other Hachette books by the prolific Mr. Patterson are readily available, however.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Generally, most popular books are available from Amazon within two days. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Publishers say the bookseller, whose shares have tumbled 25 percent this year as investors itch for profits, is determined to squeeze as much margin out of its suppliers as possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We have been asked legitimate questions about why many of our books are at present marked out of stock with relatively long estimated shipping times on the Amazon website, in contrast to immediate availability on other websites and in stores,&#39;&#39; said Sophie Cottrell, a Hachette spokeswoman. &#39;&#39;We are satisfying all Amazon&#39;s orders promptly.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But, she added, &#39;&#39;Amazon is holding minimal stock&#39;&#39; and restocking some of Hachette&#39;s books &#39;&#39;slowly, causing &#39;available 2-4 weeks&#39; messages.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For at least a decade, Amazon has not been shy about throwing its weight around with publishers, demanding bigger discounts and more time to pay its bills. When a publisher balked, it would withdraw the house&#39;s titles from its recommendation algorithms.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Typically, it was about 30 days before they&#39;d come back and say, &#39;Ouch, how do we make this work?&#39; &#39;&#39; an Amazon buyer told the journalist Brad Stone in his book about the company, &#39;&#39;The Everything Store.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes, though, more action was needed. The bookseller pulled all the &#39;&#39;buy&#39;&#39; buttons for Macmillan books in 2010 in a dispute over e-book pricing. Two years later, Amazon was negotiating for a higher discount with the distributor Independent Publishers Group. &#39;&#39;They decided they wanted me to change my terms,&#39;&#39; the IPG president, Mark Suchomel, said at the time. &#39;&#39;It wasn&#39;t reasonable. There&#39;s only so far we can go.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon promptly removed more than 4,000 IPG e-books from its site. After lengthy and quiet negotiations, the parties came to terms and the books were restored.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020140509ea590005r</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_062.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark118">B</a><a name="bookmark119">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">HACHETTE SAYS AMAZON IS DELAYING DELIVERY OF SOME BOOKS</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">60 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group has filed paperwork in the United States to sell stock to the public for the first time, in an embrace of the global capital markets that represents a coming-of-age for China’s booming Internet industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Alibaba is the fastest-growing Internet company in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,’’ said Sameet Sinha, an analyst with B. Riley &amp; Company, a boutique investment bank in Los Angeles. ‘‘They are like an Amazon, an eBay and a PayPal.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the filing on Tuesday, Alibaba said it intended to raise $1 billion in an initial public offering, a figure used to calculate its registration fee. But the company is expected ultimately to raise $15 billion to $20 billion, which could make it the biggest American I.P.O. since Facebook’s $16 billion offering in May 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When it makes its debut on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq market, Alibaba is also expected to have a share price that could value the company at roughly $200 billion, more than the market value of Facebook, Amazon.com or eBay, though still trailing that of Google or Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The immense size of the offering means that Alibaba shares will probably find a home in many mutual funds and pension funds, and thus indirectly in the portfolios of small investors around the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wall Street has been eagerly awaiting the Alibaba I.P.O., seeing it as perhaps the best chance yet to buy into China’s growth. Online shopping there is expected to grow at an annual rate of 27 percent, according to the iResearch Consulting Group, and Alibaba is the leader in that area.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet the offering will also divulge a company that is relatively unknown in the West and whose complex web of businesses and dealings may put off potential shareholders. Alibaba warned prospective investors that Chinese laws and regulations are difficult to understand and predict. In addition, the prospectus says that Alibaba’s management and major shareholders will control the board, giving ordinary shareholders no power over the direction of the company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In China, Alibaba’s brands are household names. It operates an online shopping center, Tmall, where global companies like Walt Disney, Apple, L’Oréal, Nike and Procter &amp; Gamble have set up virtual storefronts to sell products directly to Chinese shoppers. Another of its sites, Taobao, is aimed largely at small Chinese firms that want to sell items to Chinese consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company’s digital payment affiliate, Alipay, not only handles transactions on its sites, but is also widely used as a mobile payment system on cellphones in China, much as credit cards are used in other countries. It handled</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$519 billion worth of payments last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last year, the value of all merchandise sold on Alibaba exceeded $248 billion, more than the volume on eBay and Amazon combined. In the last three months of last year, nearly 20 percent of the purchases on Alibaba were made through mobile phones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">American companies like Google and eBay can only dream of making the kind of profit margin that Alibaba enjoys. In the 2013 calendar year, Alibaba had net income of $3.56 billion on revenue of $7.95 billion, which translates into a profit margin of roughly 45 percent. In comparison, eBay mustered a 17.8 percent margin.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alibaba has much higher profit margins than American Internet companies, analysts say, because its costs are low. It does not own the merchandise sold on its sites, making money instead from the merchants that pay a commission for access or that buy ads to promote themselves. Alibaba also enjoys a low tax rate of about 10 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alibaba is one of China’s top three Internet players, along with the search engine company Baidu and the media and gaming conglomerate Tencent, but it is bigger and more profitable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some investors have resorted to indirect routes to get a piece of Alibaba, like buying stock in Yahoo and SoftBank of Japan. SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications giant, is Alibaba’s biggest investor, with a 34.4 percent stake. Yahoo is next, with 22.6 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jack Ma, Alibaba’s founder, is the biggest individual shareholder, owning 8.9 percent of the stock; he is followed by his longtime lieutenant, Joseph C. Tsai, who owns 3.6 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When Yahoo first bought a 40 percent stake in 2005, it valued Alibaba at just $2.5 billion. Six years later, when a consortium of investors took another stake, the company was valued at about $32 billion. Now, analysts estimate that Alibaba may be worth from $130 billion to $235 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many details of the offering, such as the share price and the number of shares to be sold, have not yet been set. Shares are not expected to begin publicly trading for several months, as the Securities and Exchange Commission reviews Alibaba’s offering materials.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That time frame increases the risk that investors may be less willing to take a chance on an expensive Internet stock. Technology stocks have fallen sharply in the last few weeks after an impressive run, with some analysts saying that they are overvalued. The market’s appetite for I.P.O.s has also cooled.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Alibaba amassed its multibillion-dollar fortune a little at a time, shrewdly capitalizing on two trends — the rise of the Internet and China’s growing prosperity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company does some business overseas in markets like Russia and Brazil, and has invested in several American companies. It is also building an American online marketplace called 11 Main.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But in its prospectus, Alibaba emphasized that it planned to concentrate on the Chinese market, one whose potential it believes has not been fully tapped. It cited statistics showing that only about 45.8 percent of the country’s population uses the Internet, significantly lower than in the United States and Japan. And only about 49 percent of customers in the country shopped online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yahoo, which currently owns about 22.6 percent of Alibaba on a fully diluted basis, is set to sell 208 million shares in the offering, leaving it with a roughly 13.6 percent stake. Other big shareholders, like SoftBank, the American private equity firm Silver Lake Partners and the Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner, are considered unlikely to sell much stock.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SoftBank, in an earnings report Wednesday, said it would not sell any of its Alibaba shares in the near future, Reuters reported from Tokyo. ‘‘Of course, that doesn’t mean we promise to hold it forever, but for now we consider Alibaba a core strategic partner,’’ especially in Asia, Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s chief executive, told reporters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">SoftBank said its holding in Alibaba had added 66.78 billion yen, or $656 million, to its pretax profit in the fiscal year ended last March, according to Reuters. Mr. Son added that the value of the holding could decline after the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I.P.O. because of dilution.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Alibaba keeps entering new businesses, including mobile phone service, banking, cloud computing and logistics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It’s becoming a conglomerate,’’ said Mr. Sinha, the analyst at B. Riley. ‘‘It is going into all aspects of the Internet.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document INHT000020140507ea580002w</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_064.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark122">DealBook</a><a name="bookmark123">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business Day; Dealbook</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Big Profits at Alibaba, but Filing Has Gaps</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By PETER EAVIS</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,239 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

The big numbers Alibaba has put up will probably excite many on Wall Street. The company says, for instance, that goods worth $248 billion were sold on its marketplaces in 2013, an amount more than that of </a><a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=AMZN&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon</a> <a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=EBAY&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="s1" target="_blank">and </a><a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=EBAY&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="a" target="_blank">eBay</a> <a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=FB&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="s1" target="_blank">combined. And Alibaba’s revenue grew 57 percent in the first nine months of its 2013 fiscal year. That pace is faster than at </a><u>Facebook</u><span style=" color: #000;">, currently one of America’s most successful technology companies.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=IBM&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="s1" target="_blank">Perhaps more important, Alibaba’s profit margins — which measure how much money the company gets to keep after paying its costs — will generate envy across Silicon Valley. The strong figures are encouraging some stock analysts to value the company north of $200 billion, which would be higher than </a>IBM<span class="p">’s current stock market capitalization.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To put their own price on Alibaba, investors will most likely try to compare it against other technology companies. That may be difficult. While Alibaba shares characteristics of some well-known tech names, it is, over all, quite unlike any of them.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=GOOGL&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="s1" target="_blank">Like Amazon, Alibaba dominates its home e-commerce market. But, unlike Amazon, it does not amass large amounts of inventory. Instead, like eBay, it merely matches buyers and sellers. In some ways, though, Alibaba resembles </a>Google<span class="p">. Alibaba gets a very large share of its revenue from sellers who pay for more prominent placement on the marketplaces. That income stream is akin to Google’s ad revenue. But the company did not say exactly how much revenue came from that source.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alibaba is growing faster than eBay, Facebook and Google. Its revenue surged 57 percent in the first nine months of its 2013 fiscal year.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=BIDU&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="s1" target="_blank">Compared with those American companies, Alibaba has far less revenue. But what excites investors is how much profit it earns. Alibaba’s operating profits in those first nine months totaled $3.1 billion, which was equivalent to 48 percent of revenue — a margin that is far higher than at Google, eBay and Amazon. Its operating margins are also better than those at other public Chinese Internet firms, including </a>Baidu<span class="p">, a search engine, and Tencent, which is pre-eminent in messaging and gaming.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/investments/mutual-funds-and-etfs/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" class="s1" target="_blank">“In the last year or so, they seem to have pulled ahead of Tencent and Baidu,” said Brendan Ahern of KraneShares, which manages an </a><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/investments/mutual-funds-and-etfs/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" class="a" target="_blank">exchange-traded fund</a> <span style=" color: #000;">that focuses on Chinese Internet stocks.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, investors seeking to fully understand Alibaba may feel shortchanged by Tuesday’s filing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For one, the company did not provide crucial numbers that would allow outsiders to better gauge the performance of the two online marketplaces that generate nearly all of its revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some investors crave such numbers because they want to see whether Alibaba’s stellar profits growth can continue. Recent history shows that even the most successful Internet companies can be tripped up by abrupt shifts in consumer tastes and changes in technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“People want to know what the breakdown is across the various units,” Mr. Ahern said. “Hopefully, as we get closer to the I.P.O., we might see some unbundling.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alibaba makes most of its money from two major websites that dominate e-commerce in China. Taobao is a hectic-looking online bazaar where consumers can buy almost anything, from fresh groceries to building supplies to pets to concert tickets. The other is Tmall, a more streamlined marketplace where well-known brands are sold.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the filing did not break out revenue or earnings for each marketplace. If growth at one of the two sites starts to slow down, for instance, outsiders might not be able to spot that trend for some time. Instead, Alibaba has combined revenue for both websites under a line called “China commerce retail business.” That revenue stream was $5.4 billion in the first nine months its 2013 fiscal year, which was more than 60 percent higher than in the same period of 2012. The Chinese retail revenue accounted for 83 percent of the firm’s total revenue of $6.5 billion in the period. Alibaba did not break out costs or earnings for the segment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Chinese company has gone to some lengths to explain its mobile business. Investors want to see evidence that the company can still post strong profit growth as consumers increase their use of mobile devices for shopping. Alibaba said that in the last three months of 2013, 19.7 percent of “gross merchandise value,” or the value of goods sold on its sites, came from mobile users. That is a sizable increase from 7.4 percent at the end of 2012. Alibaba, however, did not break out details for revenue from mobile. Other large e-commerce firms also do not break out such figures, but Facebook does disclose how much of its advertising revenue comes from mobile.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The big question hanging over Alibaba’s I.P.O. is whether it can protect its profits. Sometimes, such high levels of profitability can signal that a company has advantages that may fade and expose it to competition.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alibaba’s supporters, however, say that the firm is fiercely competitive — and has gone to great efforts to keep rivals at bay.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has also taken brash steps to defend its revenue that, for now at least, seem to be paying off. The company, for instance, does not allow Baidu, the search engine, to search its marketplaces. As a result, consumers go straight to Alibaba’s sites to perform their shopping searches. This deprives Baidu of a form of ad revenue that Google has long earned when consumers click through to sellers from its search engine. Instead, Alibaba gets the search revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As savvy as the Baidu ban looks now, it may become a source of concern. As the number of listings on Alibaba grows, it will need to ensure it attracts a steady flow of traffic to its sites. To do that, it may need the help of outside sites, like Baidu. If that were to happen, it might become less profitable as it is forced to share revenue with other firms.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Alibaba’s public offering document only makes one mention of Baidu.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts who are bullish on Alibaba say it makes sense to value it in line with Baidu or Tencent. Those firms have stock market values around 30 times the earnings analysts expect for next year. Applying that multiple to Alibaba’s 2013 calendar-year earnings of $3.6 billion would value the company at $108 billion, well below the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$200 billion some analysts think is possible. To get to the higher number, they use estimates of future earnings, which they expect to be much higher as Alibaba increases its presence in China, where e-commerce activity is below that of Western countries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Investors are longing for growth — and here’s a company that really has it,” Mr. Ahern said.</p></li></ul></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/facebook-to-join-s-p-500/" class="a" target="_blank">Facebook to Join S.&amp;P. </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/facebook-to-join-s-p-500/" target="_blank">500</a></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Chinese Giant Alibaba Will Go Public, Listing in U.S.<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020140507ea560005l</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_065.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark124">You&#39;re the Boss</a><a name="bookmark125">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business Day; Small Business</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">When Amazon Collects Sales Tax, Some Shoppers Head Elsewhere</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By ROBB MANDELBAUM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">907 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">28 April 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For years, Amazon watchers — especially Amazon’s competitors and opponents — have wondered just how much the company has benefited from not having to collect sales tax on most of its transactions. Now, three economists appear to have answered the question with a new study: In states that recently forced the online behemoth to begin collecting those taxes, Amazon’s sales have fallen sharply.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The researchers also found that after Amazon began collecting tax in those states, consumers spent more money with the company’s competitors — with most of those purchases taking place online, too.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/743?q" class="s1" target="_blank">The results come as Congress considers legislation that would permit states to force big online retailers to collect sales tax from their residents. The Senate passed the </a><a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/743?q" class="a" target="_blank">Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013</a> <a href="http://www.govtech.com/budget-finance/The-Time-May-Have-Arrived-for-Online-Sales-Tax-Fairness.html" class="s1" target="_blank">in, well, 2013. Some proponents are </a><a href="http://www.govtech.com/budget-finance/The-Time-May-Have-Arrived-for-Online-Sales-Tax-Fairness.html" class="a" target="_blank">optimistic</a> <span style=" color: #000;">the House will pass its own bill this year.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://papers.nber.org/tmp/51204-w20052.pdf" class="s1" target="_blank">For their </a><a href="http://papers.nber.org/tmp/51204-w20052.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">study</a> <span style=" color: #000;">, the researchers — doctoral candidates and a professor at Ohio State University — examined data from an online personal finance company that aggregates consumer financial statements. The researchers had access to the credit and debit card transactions of nearly three million consumers across the country, including all of the information you might see on your own credit card statement: the date and time of the transaction, the amount, and the name and location of the seller receiving payment. (The individual consumers were not identified personally; each was represented by a number.)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The researchers zeroed in on about 250,000 consumers across the country who spent more than $100 with Amazon in the first half of 2012. For five of the states that imposed a tax-collection obligation on Amazon in 2012 and 2013 — California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia — the researchers compared spending at Amazon in each state in the three months before and after the date the policy took effect. Then they measured the difference against spending in the states where the tax rules did not change.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What’s novel about our approach is we didn’t approach Amazon and say, ‘Give us your sales data.’ They’d never in a million years give us this data,” said one of the economists, Brian Baugh. “I think this is their dirty little secret, something they’ve never been forthright about it — the extent to which this sales tax advantage has benefited them. They’ve never put a number to it.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Baugh and his colleagues have. They found that across the five states, spending at Amazon dropped almost 10 percent in the three months after sales tax collection began. With larger purchases, the drop-off was even steeper: Transactions over $300, for example, fell by 24 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So where, then, are these consumers spending their money? The Ohio State researchers looked into that, too, although the results are murkier. They tallied up online and brick-and-mortar purchases at a dozen of the largest retailers, including Walmart, Target, Home Depot and Best Buy. In most states, they saw a bump in sales, mostly online, after Amazon started collecting tax. Internet sales at these retailers grew 20 percent. Sales at their physical stores increased only 2 percent.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://standwithmainstreet.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">Interestingly, customers who switched to these retailers were doing it for other reasons than recovering the sales tax savings — all of these companies typically have long had to collect sales taxes on online purchases because their brick-and-mortar outlets amount to a physical presence in most states.

(Texas consumers, though, increased their spending at the Marketplace by 41 percent, many times more than in the other four states.) As we </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/study-suggests-online-sales-tax-bill-could-leave-billions-untaxed" class="a" target="_blank">reported</a> <span style=" color: #000;">last year, third-party sales through Amazon’s Marketplace are growing so rapidly that they were poised to exceed Amazon’s own retail sales in 2013.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The economists did not attempt the difficult task of tracking how much spending changed at other independent retailers, either online or on Main Street. “Retail is so concentrated at these stores now,” explained Mr. Baugh, referring to the major chains. “I don’t think that’s a fault with our approach at all.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In other words, even without knowing how much or even whether small businesses benefited from Amazon’s collection of sales tax, Mr. Baugh says the trend is clear: Money that had been spent at Amazon is mostly being redistributed to other online giants — and that will very likely intensify if Congress allows broad taxation of Internet sales. “This legislation is being pushed as a kind of savior to brick-and-mortar stores and a boon to local economies,” he said of the Marketplace Fairness Act, “and it doesn’t appear to be the case to me.”</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/introducing-erica-bell-and-katie-finnegan-new-business-group-members/" class="a" target="_blank">Introducing Erica Bell and Katie Finnegan, New Business Group </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/introducing-erica-bell-and-katie-finnegan-new-business-group-members/" target="_blank">Members</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/study-suggests-online-sales-tax-bill-could-leave-billions-untaxed/" class="a" target="_blank">Study Suggests Online Sales Tax Bill Could Leave Billions </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/study-suggests-online-sales-tax-bill-could-leave-billions-untaxed/" target="_blank">Untaxed</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/a-web-site-tries-to-convince-mattress-shoppers-to-buy-online/" class="a" target="_blank">A Web Site Tries to Convince Mattress Shoppers to Buy </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/a-web-site-tries-to-convince-mattress-shoppers-to-buy-online/" target="_blank">Online</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/an-e-commerce-company-learns-to-sell-directly-on-facebook/" class="a" target="_blank">E-Commerce Company Learns to Sell Directly on </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/an-e-commerce-company-learns-to-sell-directly-on-facebook/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">For Local Businesses, the Internet Threat Isn’t Just the Sales Tax<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020140428ea4s001p5</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_066.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark126">TV Drama The Upshot</a><a name="bookmark127">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Netflix vs. Amazon, and the New Economics of Television</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By NEIL IRWIN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">822 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">27 April 2014 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s been a busy week for the companies in the business of trying to revolutionize how we watch television.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Netflix struck a deal to make its video streaming service available through set-top boxes offered by three cable companies, said it would raise its prices for new customers, and publicly objected to a planned merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable. HBO struck a deal to offer its shows on a formidable Netflix competitor, Amazon Prime. Oh, and while we’re at it, AT&amp;T and the Chernin Group said they would introduce a new, $500 million venture to compete in the same crowded market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To make sense of the changing tides of media (and especially television) economics, remember this simple idea: To be successful in the evolving world of media, a company needs to control either the content, or the pipes. If it has neither, it’s a mere middleman, consigned to low or no profitability.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Somebody has to create compelling things that people want to watch, whether it’s “Game of Thrones” or an NFL game. The rewards for creating that content are great; if you succeed, you have leverage with whomever will do the distributing, whether a cable network like HBO or AMC or a digital service like Netflix or Hulu.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, whoever controls the ultimate means by which people get information and programming into their living room has a great deal of power. That could in theory be your local phone company or a satellite provider, but in practice for most people in the United States it is the cable company. This, too, is no easy thing to establish.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whereas content creators must navigate the ever-shifting winds of Hollywood, the company controlling the pipes has to spend billions to lay wires under the ground of major cities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you possess one or the other of those things, desirable content or a means of distribution, you have a strong starting position in the inevitable negotiations over licensing deals. Otherwise, you are a at major disadvantage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Twenty years ago, HBO was closer to a middleman, taking movies made by studios and charging high cable fees to bring them to your cable dial. The problem with that strategy was that it left HBO vulnerable to changing technology. As on-demand movies got better, and as people began consuming more video online, HBO was at risk of being squeezed by the movie studios who provided content and the cable distributors who controlled the pipes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So HBO began more aggressively developing its own content, eventually scoring major hits like “Sex and the City” and “The Sopranos” that ensured that cable operators (owners of the pipes) would need HBO as much as HBO needed them.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/business/amazon-to-offer-original-hbo-content.html" class="s1" target="_blank">HBO’s new deal with Amazon appears to be a way to make some extra money from the back-catalog of older shows, while not cannibalizing people who may want to subscribe to get the hottest, newest shows, including “Game of Thrones” and “True Detective.” Their deal, </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/business/amazon-to-offer-original-hbo-content.html" class="a" target="_blank">said to be worth</a> <span style=" color: #000;">more than $300 million for a bunch of shows, many of which aired more than a decade ago, shows how having original content has given HBO leverage.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This time a couple of years ago, Netflix and the video offerings of Amazon Prime were facing the same challenge that HBO did in the 1990s, operating solely as middlemen between producers of content and the people who want to consume it. Each has now taken a page from the HBO of the 1990s, and started trying to come up with the type of original content that will give them leverage with cable companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2726918/" class="s1" target="_blank">That’s why Netflix has produced “House of Cards,” “Orange is the New Black,” and a new season of “Arrested </a><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084685/" class="s1" target="_blank">Development.” (Not all of its programs have been that successful.

Amazon’s original programming, still early in its development, has generated less buzz (“Alpha House” is the closest thing to a success so far), but is following very much the same strategy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surely Netflix’s success of some of those shows contributed to the company’s confidence that it can raise prices without losing too many customers. And surely the sense that it is creating products consumers want helped embolden the company to take an assertive stance against consolidation in the cable industry.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/business/media/yahoo-rolls-the-dice-on-tv.html" class="s1" target="_blank">We might all think we would make brilliant studio titans, but creating great TV series is harder than it sounds; read my colleage David Carr’s </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/business/media/yahoo-rolls-the-dice-on-tv.html" class="a" target="_blank">recent column</a> <span style=" color: #000;">on Yahoo’s efforts to do so captures the challenge.

All Rights Reserved. Is a 20-year honeymoon coming to an end?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When it comes to suspending disbelief about a lack of profits -- the only thing that ultimately matters when it comes to stock valuation -- Amazon.com has been in a class of its own. Its price-to-earnings ratio, a common measure of stock valuation, has at various times topped 3,000 (the market average is about 18) -- and that&#39;s when it actually has had a profit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Investors never seemed to care. &#39;&#39;Over the long history of the last eight years, this stock went from $60 to $400, which made all the doubters look stupid while all the believers got rich,&#39;&#39; said Bruce Greenwald, a professor and head of the value investing program at Columbia Business School. &#39;&#39;The fact that Amazon did this in the face of deteriorating operating performance -- slower growth in sales and the evaporation in profit margins -- has made fools of the people who looked at the reality of its operations.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That may be changing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Thursday, Amazon reported that revenue grew a healthy 23 percent during the first quarter, topping analysts&#39; forecasts and warming hearts of Amazon loyalists. Revenue gains have always been enough to drive Amazon&#39;s stock price higher, and it rose in after-hours trading. But then, on Friday, investors seemed to focus on the one thing they&#39;ve always ignored: profits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although Amazon reported revenue of nearly $20 billion, it said its operating income fell 19 percent, to $146 million. Net income was a modest $108 million. Perhaps more unnerving was the company&#39;s forecast for next quarter: flat revenue and a loss that might be as big as $455 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shares plunged, dropping nearly 10 percent, or more than $30, to just over $300 at Friday&#39;s close. They hit a record high of $408 earlier this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is the second quarter in a row that Amazon&#39;s results have set off selling. Amazon shares plunged 11 percent on Jan. 31, after fourth-quarter revenue and profits were lower than analysts&#39; forecasts. But this time, revenue beat forecasts, suggesting that it&#39;s the minimal profit that&#39;s worrying investors</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other technology stocks have also soared to what some investors have deemed absurd valuations. This week, the noted hedge fund manager David Einhorn warned, &#39;&#39;We are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15 years.&#39;&#39; The market has been roiled in recent weeks, as it was on Friday, by sell-offs in some high-flying technology companies, including Netflix, Tesla and Twitter. But they are still relatively young companies that are trading on expectations that have yet to be tempered by reality, and none of them was as hard hit as Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even after this week&#39;s plunge, Amazon&#39;s shares remain expensive by most measures. Its price-to-earnings ratio was still over 500.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s lofty valuation has long baffled many investors and analysts. But one thing they can agree on: Betting against Amazon has invariably turned out to be a mistake over the long term. (The stock has tripled over the past five years.)</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A dozen Wall Street analysts lowered their ratings on Amazon on Friday, but until this week&#39;s earnings report, they were overwhelmingly positive about the company, with 35 of 44 analysts rating the stock a strong buy or buy. Until this week, downgrading Amazon -- no matter what its valuation -- hasn&#39;t been a path to popularity, as Eric J. Sheridan, an Internet analyst at UBS Securities, found out in February, when he reduced Amazon to neutral from buy. &#39;&#39;Amazon is the third rail of investing,&#39;&#39; he told me this week. &#39;&#39;I had hundreds of angry people calling me for days. How dare I say anything negative about Amazon?&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By contrast, investors punished Google last week after it reported strong revenue gains and billions of dollars of operating profit. &#39;&#39;Investors won&#39;t cut Google any slack,&#39;&#39; Mr. Sheridan said. &#39;&#39;I like Google. The valuation is very reasonable. The quote unquote shock, in their earnings, was that margins were a little weaker than expected. Google is spending on new initiatives. It&#39;s just a reminder that they&#39;re ambitious and innovative.&#39;&#39; That&#39;s exactly what investors have always said they loved about Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Google shouldn&#39;t be viewed as a mature company,&#39;&#39; Mr. Sheridan said, but it is. Amazon, founded in 1994, is actually four years older than Google.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stock prices are a reflection of investors&#39; predictions of future profits, which is why there&#39;s always an element of gazing into a crystal ball. The future earnings of mature companies with long track records can be forecast with considerable accuracy, but for newcomers, especially in untested technologies, it&#39;s mostly sophisticated guesswork.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon isn&#39;t a newcomer, but it has long had a powerful story driving expectations: the notion that it will become the global Walmart of Internet retailing. Walmart has been one of the most successful companies of all time and something of a holy grail for investors. Anyone lucky enough to have invested $1,000 in shares at the time of its 1970 initial public offering and have held them is now worth many millions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart&#39;s headiest growth is probably behind it, and Amazon is still expanding revenue by the 23 percent it reported this week. Still, the comparison to Walmart goes only so far. Walmart&#39;s operating profit margin is 5.6 percent. Amazon&#39;s is a minuscule 0.7 percent. Walmart has been consistently profitable since its earliest days, but for Amazon, bumper profits have always been just beyond the horizon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So analysts and investors have tended to measure Amazon based on revenue rather than profits. On that basis, Amazon&#39;s price looks fairly reasonable: Its price to sales ratio is just over 2. (Google&#39;s is 5.7.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But that seems to be changing. &#39;&#39;With Amazon you&#39;ve had a cult investor group that believed that all that matters is revenue growth,&#39;&#39; Mr. Sheridan said. &#39;&#39;The problem is, in the last year and a half, the growth rate has started to slow quickly. It was 40 percent two years ago and now it&#39;s close to 20 percent.&#39;&#39; He said there were plenty of other Internet companies growing in the midteens to 20 percent, including Google, Priceline and eBay, and they&#39;re much cheaper. &#39;&#39;Reality is starting to settle in,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And Professor Greenwald noted that product sales -- the core of Amazon&#39;s business -- grew by only 18 percent in the quarter, and the projections for the next quarter also suggested slower revenue growth. &#39;&#39;And profits were a disaster,&#39;&#39; he added.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, should the Walmart analogy cool, Amazon always seems to have another story. This week, it unveiled a deal to stream some HBO programs over the Internet, and it has been commissioning original programming. No matter that Amazon won&#39;t gain access to some of HBO&#39;s hottest properties, like &#39;&#39;Game of Thrones.&#39;&#39; For some investors, Amazon is now the new Netflix. Or there&#39;s the cloud story, in which Amazon&#39;s cloud computing services makes it the new Salesforce.com. (On a price-to-sales basis, Amazon is cheaper than either Netflix or Salesforce.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But perhaps Amazon is now spinning too many stories for investors to digest. This week, it also talked about getting into package delivery, a low-margin, high-cost business dominated by United Parcel Service and FedEx. And it even mentioned developing smartphones, an intensely competitive field that has already proved daunting for Google and Microsoft.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, if history is any guide, this week&#39;s drop in Amazon based on one quarter&#39;s results may just be another buying opportunity, and not a reversal of a 20-year trend. Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst at RBC Capital markets, reiterated his outperform rating after the earnings were released, though he dropped his price target to $400. He still sees it as a compelling growth story. He noted that Amazon accounted for only 2 percent of global retail sales, &#39;&#39;if that,&#39;&#39; adding, &#39;&#39;So there&#39;s a belief that Amazon&#39;s long-term growth is likely to be more robust than Google&#39;s, because it has lower market penetration.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Mahaney said investors trusted Amazon&#39;s chief executive, Jeffrey Bezos, even though he&#39;s notoriously stingy about releasing information beyond that required by law, and have been impressed by his agility. Amazon &#39;&#39;is a company that created devices when it was just a retailer and successfully went into cloud computing. People keep believing they can catch the latest trend. They&#39;ve gotten a pass for that.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He described Amazon as a company that focuses on the long term. &#39;&#39;To their credit, they&#39;ve made big long-term bets that paid off and were willing to sacrifice short-term earnings,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Getting the right valuation is tough, but I feel very strongly that five years from now,&#39;&#39; Amazon &#39;&#39;will be a bigger part of global G.D.P. than it is now.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeffrey P.

STEWART</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,383 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26 April 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Operating income rose nearly 10 percent, to $4.12 billion. Net income was $3.45 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those are numbers that would be the envy of just about any company. But not, apparently, when it comes to Google. When the giant Internet search and advertising company released those numbers recently, the stock got pummeled, promptly dropping $20 a share, or 4 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Compare that with Google’s e-tailing counterpart, Amazon. On Thursday, Amazon said operating income fell 19 percent, to $146 million. Net income was $108 million — a rounding error for Google. And the company projected a loss for next quarter. Yet Amazon shares rose in after-hours trading, before easing about 1.7 percent by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">late-morning trading on Friday in New York.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When it comes to suspending disbelief about the lack of profit — the only thing that ultimately matters when it comes to stock valuation — Amazon may be in a class of its own. Its price-to-earnings ratio, a common measure of stock valuation, has at various times topped 3,000 (the average for the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index is about 19) — and that’s when Amazon has actually had a profit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other technology stocks have also soared to what some investors deem absurd valuations. In the past week, the noted hedge fund manager David Einhorn warned, ‘‘We are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15 years.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The market has been roiled in recent weeks by sell-offs in some technology companies, including Amazon. Sometimes mentioned in the same breath are Netflix, Tesla and Twitter, but they are all still relatively young companies trading on expectations that have yet to be tempered by reality. Amazon has been around for 20 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google is hardly the only highly successful company that investors hold to a high standard. But it has much in common with Amazon. Both are big — Google’s market capitalization is $354 billion, and Amazon’s is $155 billion. They’re both investing heavily in new ventures and technologies. Their chief executives disdain quarterly results and say they invest for the long term. They purport to be unconcerned about day-to-day moves in their stocks (and, as billionaires, they can afford to be). Both companies have the kind of stories, like wearable technology (Google Glass) and Internet streaming (Amazon Prime) that investors usually love.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Yet Google’s price-to-earnings ratio is 28. Amazon’s is 571. How could that be?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a supposedly rational market, that question leaves many analysts and investors scratching their heads. But one thing they can agree on: Betting against Amazon has invariably turned out to be a mistake in the long term. (The stock has tripled over the last five years.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite Amazon’s lofty valuation, analysts are overwhelmingly positive about the company, with 35 of 44 analysts rating the stock a strong buy or buy. Downgrading Amazon — no matter its valuation — isn’t a path to popularity, as Eric J. Sheridan, an Internet analyst at UBS Securities, found out in February, when he reduced Amazon from ‘‘buy’’ to ‘‘neutral.’’ ‘‘Amazon is the third rail of investing,’’ he told me in the past week. ‘‘I had hundreds of angry people calling me for days. How dare I say anything negative about Amazon?’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By contrast, Mr. Sheridan said, ‘‘Investors won’t cut Google any slack.’’ He added: ‘‘I like Google. The valuation is very reasonable. The quote-unquote shock, in their earnings, was that margins were a little weaker than</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">expected. Google is spending on new initiatives. It’s just a reminder that they’re ambitious and innovative.’’ That’s exactly what investors say they love about Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A problem for Google’s valuation may be that the company has been so profitable for so long. Stock prices reflect investors’ predictions of future profits, which is why there’s always an element of gazing into a crystal ball. The future earnings of mature companies with long track records can be forecast with considerable accuracy, but for newcomers, especially in untested technologies, it’s mostly sophisticated guesswork. Google was profitable almost from Day 1 and has often exceeded forecasts. As a result, its profits and margins are closely scrutinized, and even a minor disappointment can set off selling.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For Amazon, bumper profits have always been just beyond the horizon. So analysts and investors tend to measure Amazon based on revenue rather than profits. On that basis, Amazon looks fairly reasonable: Its price-to-sales ratio is just 2. Google’s is 5.7.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And Amazon has a powerful story behind it: the notion that it will become the global Walmart of Internet retailing. Walmart has been one of the most successful companies of all time and something of a holy grail for investors. Anyone lucky enough to have invested $1,000 in shares at the time of its initial public offering in 1970 and holds them is now worth many millions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘With Amazon, you’ve got a cult investor group that believes that all that matters is revenue growth,’’ Mr. Sheridan said. ‘‘The problem is, in the last year and a half, the growth rate has started to slow quickly. It was 40 percent two years ago, and now it’s close to 20 percent.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even after the recent rally, Amazon shares have dropped 16 percent over the last three months, so Mr. Sheridan’s February call was timely.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, should the Walmart analogy cool, Amazon always seems to have another story. In the past week, it unveiled a deal to stream some HBO programs over the Internet, and it has been commissioning original programming. No matter that Amazon won’t gain access to some of HBO’s hottest properties like ‘‘Game of Thrones.’’ For some investors, Amazon is now the new Netflix. Or there’s the cloud story, in which Amazon’s cloud computing services make it the new Salesforce.com. (On a price-to-sales basis, Amazon is cheaper than either Netflix or Salesforce.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This kind of thinking drives traditional value investors crazy. (Value investors typically look for relatively low-priced stocks.) Bruce Greenwald, a professor and head of the value investing program at the Columbia Business School, called Amazon’s profits this quarter ‘‘a disaster.’’ Still, ‘‘over the long history of the last eight years, this stock went from $60 to $400, which made all the doubters look stupid while all the believers got rich. The fact that Amazon did this in the face of deteriorating operating performance — slower growth in sales and the evaporation in profit margins — has made fools of the people who looked at the reality of its operations.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets, is one of the 35 analysts with a buy recommendation on Amazon. He sees it as a compelling growth story, noting that while Google now accounts for roughly 15 percent of the total worldwide advertising market, Amazon accounts for about 2 percent of global retail sales, ‘‘if that.’’ So, he said, ‘‘There’s a belief that Amazon’s long-term growth is likely to be more robust than Google’s, because it has lower market penetration.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Mahaney said investors trusted Amazon’s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos — even though he’s notoriously stingy about releasing information beyond that required by law — and were impressed by his agility. Amazon ‘‘is a company that created devices when it was just a retailer and successfully went into cloud computing. People keep believing they can catch the latest trend. They get a pass for that.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But he also likes Google and has a buy rating on Google shares. ‘‘It’s O.K. to like both stocks,’’ he said. ‘‘Google will do better in a defensive market, and Amazon is more of a momentum play.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The simple answer may be that the stock market isn’t always rational. ‘‘It’s really just a handful of people that determine the price of the stock,’’ Mr. Mahaney said. ‘‘They’re hedge fund managers and big fund managers. They’re all people with more money than time, and they’re Amazon Prime customers. They use it, and they love it. There’s just not the same emotional attachment to Google.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document INHT000020140425ea4q0003f</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_070.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark134">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</a><a name="bookmark135">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Earnings News and Tension Over Ukraine Propel a Fall</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">653 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26 April 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 6</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The stock market fell sharply on Friday, dragged down by disappointing quarterly results from Amazon and Ford Motor. Tensions between the United States and Russia over Ukraine also weighed on the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Worried investors sold their riskier assets and moved into the traditional havens: bonds, gold and stocks like utilities that pay high dividends.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500-stock index fell 15.21 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,863.40. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 140.19 points, or 0.9 percent, to 16,361.46 and the Nasdaq composite fell 72.78 points, or 1.8 percent, to 4,075.56.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Friday&#39;s sell-off was enough to push the Dow, S.&amp;P. 500 and Nasdaq into the red for the week. Technology stocks, which have been volatile for the last two months, were again a hotbed of selling.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shares of Amazon, the world&#39;s largest online store, fell $33.32, or nearly 10 percent, to $303.83. Amazon reported late on Thursday that, despite a 23 percent increase in revenue, its operating profit fell 19 percent from the period last year, and that investments would probably lead to a second-quarter operating loss.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon dragged the rest of the technology sector lower, making it one of the worst-performing sectors in the S.&amp;P. 500. Netflix fell more than 6 percent, Priceline dipped almost 5 percent, Facebook fell 5 percent and Twitter dropped more than 7 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investors have had little patience for companies missing their forecasts, said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The market is in a precarious position at the moment, and overreacts to bad news far more than it did last year,&#39;&#39; he said, noting the 10 percent drop in Amazon&#39;s stock, even though the company met analysts&#39; forecasts for the most recent quarter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine also weighed on investor sentiment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday accused Russia of failing to live up to its commitments to ease the Ukraine crisis. Mr. Kerry said bluntly that unless Moscow took steps to de-escalate the situation, Washington would impose more sanctions. In a separate event, Ukraine&#39;s deputy foreign minister said he feared a Russian invasion was imminent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Investments thought to be less risky were among the few assets to rise on Friday. Bond prices rose, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down to 2.67 percent from 2.68 percent Thursday, while its price rose 5/32, to 100 24/32. Gold rose $10.20, or 0.8 percent, to $1,300.70 an ounce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Shares of Visa fell $10.47, or 5 percent, to $198.93 after it warned that American sanctions were prompting Russian banks to use other companies to process payments. President Vladimir V. Putin said Russia would create its own payment-processing system. MasterCard was also hurt by the news. Its stock fell $3.69, or 5 percent, to $70.66.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Visa&#39;s decline made up roughly half of the Dow&#39;s fall on Friday.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The stock market declined in the face of an encouraging report on consumer sentiment. The University of Michigan said that consumer confidence surged in April, to 84.1 in April from 80 in March. The latest rating was just a point below the 85.1 reached last July, which was the highest in nearly seven years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Americans have cut back on debt and benefited from steady hiring and rising stock and home prices, the report said. Just 28 percent said this month that their finances were worsening, down from 37 percent in March and the lowest level since April 2007.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CHART: The Dow Minute by Minute: Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals yesterday.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon defines corporate prosperity in terms of sales growth rather than profit. By its definition, which has been embraced on Wall Street, the big Internet merchant had a strong first quarter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s revenue grew 23 percent to $19.74 billion, up from $16.07 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Its growth surpassed analysts&#39; average estimate of $19.4 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The top-line growth is still there,&#39;&#39; said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research. &#39;&#39;This is largely how they have to deliver.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company&#39;s net income rose in the quarter to $108 million, compared with $82 million in the first quarter of 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s earnings of 23 cents per share hit analysts&#39; diminished forecasts. Three months ago, analysts were expecting 54 cents a share, but a rougher-than-expected fourth quarter trimmed their expectations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excluding one-time transactions, the company&#39;s operating profit fell 19 percent to $146 million, down from $181 million in the first quarter of 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In after-hours trading, Amazon shares rose slightly, after increasing nearly 4 percent in the regular trading session, closing at $337.15 a share.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Relative soft spots did surface in the quarter. International sales, for example, rose a more modest 18 percent, to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$7.88 billion, a bit below the overall corporate performance. Amazon&#39;s overseas media sales -- digital movies, television programs and books -- were particularly weak, increasing less than 4 percent, to $2.64 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But in a conference call, Tom Szkutak, Amazon&#39;s chief financial officer, emphasized the corporate growth trend. &#39;&#39;We are pleased with the overall fundamentals,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;A lot of areas contributed to growth.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon recently raised the price of its Prime unlimited merchandise shipping and video service by 25 percent, to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$99 a year. That price increase, Mr. Szkutak suggested, was not facing resistance from customers. He declined to give specific numbers, but did say the company is &#39;&#39;very encouraged,&#39;&#39; with Prime memberships increasing week over week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s cloud computing business, Mr. Szkutak said, is growing rapidly, despite cutting prices to remain a leader at a time when many technology companies like Google, IBM and Microsoft are investing heavily in the market for remotely supplied computing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon does not break out the numbers for its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services. Its results are included in an opaque category the company calls &#39;&#39;other.&#39;&#39; Revenue growth in the other category rose 58 percent from a year ago, to $1.26 billion. Amazon Web Services, Mr. Szkutak said, is &#39;&#39;a big part of that.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the second quarter of this year, Amazon said that it expected sales from $18.1 billion to $19.8 billion, or growth between 15 percent to 26 percent, compared with the year-earlier quarter. And the company said it anticipated reporting an operating loss of between $55 million to $455 million, compared with an operating profit of $79 million in the second quarter of 2013. That guidance, the company said, includes $455 million for stock-based compensation for its employees and other costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Never exactly a laggard on the product development front, Amazon has been outdoing itself recently. Its</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">long-rumored phone is reported to be on the verge of appearing. A set-top box called Amazon Fire is now out, to mixed reviews. And Amazon is spending $300 million or so on programming from HBO, led by &#39;&#39;The Sopranos.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A few weeks ago, Amazon quietly introduced Dash, a wand that can be used to reorder household items, from toilet paper to guitar strings. If the needed product does not have a bar code to scan, Dash has a microphone to take orders. The video commercial for Dash shows children restocking their house. And on Wednesday, Amazon introduced Prime Pantry, a grocery delivery service for its Prime customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This ceaseless innovation comes as some of Amazon&#39;s long-term advantages are eroding. Sales tax reform is stalled in the House of Representatives, but Amazon has made enough deals with individual states that a sizable chunk of its customers now pay the tax.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That makes items purchased from Amazon from 5 to 10 percent more expensive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a paper released this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research, transactions in five states -- California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia -- were examined. All the states began collecting tax from Amazon purchases in the last two years. The study concluded that households had reduced Amazon expenditures by an average of 9.5 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asked about the impact of states requiring Amazon to collect sales tax, Mr. Szkutak pointed to Amazon&#39;s sales numbers in North America, up 26 percent in the first quarter, suggesting there was scant effect so far.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A worker at an Amazon fulfillment center.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon will stream a selection of HBO series, mini-series and original movies as part of its Prime subscription service, the latest alliance between technology and entertainment companies trying to capture viewers who are moving online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The deal, announced on Wednesday, deepens the commitment of Amazon and its chief, Jeffrey P. Bezos, to the tough but potentially lucrative television market, while escalating its competition with Netflix and other competitors offering programming over the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Beginning May 21, Amazon Prime members will have access to older HBO shows like ‘‘The Sopranos’’ and ‘‘The Wire,’’ and mini-series like ‘‘Band of Brothers’’ and ‘‘Angels in America.’’ Some seasons of current series, like ‘‘True Blood,’’ will also be available.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is the first time HBO is making its licensed content available to online consumers outside of the traditional pay TV business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Certain shows, like ‘‘Sex and the City’’ and ‘‘Curb Your Enthusiasm,’’ which are subject to other licensing deals, are excluded from the deal, as are standout hits like ‘‘Game of Thrones’’ and ‘‘True Detective.’’ It also excludes the roster of studio movies that HBO offers subscribers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The deal represents a small step outside of HBO’s highly profitable cable subscription model and toward the web-only streaming that many see as the future of television. But it is notable that some of the channel’s most popular programming was excluded and thus remains firmly entrenched within the traditional cable business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Terms of the agreement, described as ‘‘multiyear,’’ were not disclosed, but a person briefed on the deal said it was worth at least $300 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That kind of price tag underscores the enormous value attached to the kinds of popular, high-quality movies and TV shows that can reliably draw audiences. ‘‘The Sopranos’’ and ‘‘The Wire,’’ in particular, are considered pioneers of novelistic, highbrow TV as a genre and are rewatched like classic movies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon, the giant e-commerce company, has been vying with competitors like Netflix to acquire such content and also produce original programming in the hope of persuading viewers to subscribe to its $99-a-year Prime service, which began by offering free shipping on merchandise but has grown to include other offerings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has also discussed the possibility of HBO’s producing shows for it, according to a person knowledgeable about the relationship between the companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Today’s news is a clear sign that Amazon is intent on closing the content gap with Netflix,’’ Stephen Shin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients. He said the move validated Netflix’s decision, announced on Monday, to raise prices for new customers, so that it can ‘‘fund more content acquisition.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140424ea4p0003k</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_074.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark142">Comparison Shopping The Upshot</a><a name="bookmark143">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Amazon.com is learning the hard way that people care more about price than brand loyalty.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">278 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24 April 2014 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014.

Although bricks-and-mortar retailers and state governments pushed for Amazon to collect sales tax, they did not necessarily benefit. Sales increased only 2 percent at local stores, but rose nearly 20 percent at competing online retailers that do not charge sales tax. For expensive purchases, the rivals saw a 24 percent increase.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/14/technology/amazon-is-raising-prime-membership-fee.html" class="s1" target="_blank">At this point, there is little that will bring online shoppers back to bricks-and-mortar stores. Nor is there much that will keep them shopping at Amazon if they can find a price even a few dollars lower on another site. Other surveys have shown that people will gladly leave a site for another that offers free shipping. Last month, Amazon </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/14/technology/amazon-is-raising-prime-membership-fee.html" class="a" target="_blank">increased the price</a> <span style=" color: #000;">of its Prime service 25 percent to $99 a year, which provides free shipping.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But there, Amazon, which announces quarterly earnings Thursday, has a surprising advantage. Once people have paid their $99, they feel a psychological pull to buy from Amazon to make their investment worth it — even if a lower price is only a click away. (Economists would say that is irrational behavior because the $99 is a sunk cost.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

Researchers recently discovered a major flaw in OpenSSL that they called Heartbleed.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, Cisco, Dell, Facebook, Fujitsu, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NetApp, Rackspace, Qualcomm and VMWare have each pledged $100,000 a year over the next three years to the Core Infrastructure Initiative, the effort organized by the Linux Foundation, which supports the popular Linux computer operating system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each backer will select representatives to sit on a steering committee along with open-source developers and academics. The committee will direct money to open-source projects. In turn, the money will be used to fund fellowships for developers to work on open-source projects full time. It will also pay for security audits, computing and testing infrastructure, travel, and coordination among companies that may be working on similar projects.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/technology/heartbleed-highlights-a-contradiction-in-the-web.html?_r=0" class="s1" target="_blank">The Core Infrastructure Initiative will start with OpenSSL. </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/technology/heartbleed-highlights-a-contradiction-in-the-web.html?_r=0" class="a" target="_blank">Despite its widespread use,</a> <span style=" color: #000;">OpenSSL is managed by only one full-time developer and a small, volunteer staff.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Open-source projects are usually software development efforts organized and run by volunteers, connected on the Internet, who work together to build, maintain and improve free software. Ideally, they check one another’s work in a peer review system. It has led to the creation of widely used software like Linux and the web browser Firefox.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/technology/heartbleed-highlights-a-contradiction-in-the-web.html?_r=0" class="s1" target="_blank">But security experts and even the open-source movement’s biggest advocates acknowledge that Heartbleed revealed </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/technology/heartbleed-highlights-a-contradiction-in-the-web.html?_r=0" class="a" target="_blank">that some crucial</a> <span style=" color: #000;">open-source systems are underfunded and suffering from a lack of resources.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In an interview on Wednesday, Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, said the most significant issue was a lack of awareness regarding which open-source projects needed what, something he said the Core Infrastructure Initiative will help address.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“This is not just about the money, but the forum,” Mr. Zemlin said. “Instead of responding to a crisis retroactively, this is an opportunity to identify crucial open-source projects in advance. Right now, nobody is having that conversation, and it’s an important conversation to have.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Core Infrastructure Initiative is one of many such projects to be discussed since the Heartbleed bug was made public two weeks ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The early open-source advocate Eric S. Raymond and other leaders in the open-source community like Paul Vixie, founder of the Internet Systems Consortium, a nonprofit Internet “action tank,” have been discussing a similar initiative called the Internet Civil Engineering Institute.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The idea was to fund security audits of crucial open-source software like OpenSSL and the Internet Time Service protocol, which synchronizes computer times over the Internet.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A global forest mapping system developed by a team of scientists from the University of Maryland, Google and the United States government is now able to pinpoint exactly where and at what rate deforestation is occurring around the world. The results are alarming. The world is losing the equivalent of 50 soccer fields of forest every minute. In Brazil -- home to 60 percent of the Amazon rain forest and a major component of the planet&#39;s climate system -- the rate of deforestation jumped 28 percent during 2012-13. Environmentalists say a 2012 change in Brazil&#39;s regulations governing forest conservation is partly responsible.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brazil had been making good progress. From a high of 10,588 square miles in 2004, deforestation dropped to 1,797 square miles in 2011; the number of metric tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere dropped as well, from 1.1 billion metric tons in 2004 to 298 million metric tons in 2011. These successes resulted from aggressive enforcement of the country&#39;s 1965 Forest Code, and a 2006 soy moratorium, a voluntary pledge brokered by the Brazilian government, agribusiness and environmental groups to prevent trade in soybeans cultivated on deforested land.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Soybeans aren&#39;t the only cause of deforestation in Brazil, but they are a major factor. Brazil is now the world&#39;s second-largest producer of soybeans after the United States. Soybeans have been a boon to Brazil&#39;s economy, and global demand is growing. Under intense pressure from agricultural interests, Brazil&#39;s Chamber of Deputies approved legislation in July 2012 that rolled back many provisions of the 1965 Forest Code, reduced the amount of reserve areas in the Amazon and gave amnesty to past violators. To her credit, Brazil&#39;s president, Dilma Rousseff, thwarted some of the most damaging provisions of the new legislation, but the rate of deforestation still rose.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The soy moratorium has been extended until the end of 2014, by which time Brazil plans to have in place new mechanisms to monitor soybean cultivation on deforested land. These mechanisms must be backed by credible enforcement. And developed countries need to do more to help Brazil, Indonesia and other nations whose forests are at risk protect a resource in which everyone has a stake.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020140416ea4g0004y</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_078.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark150">You&#39;re the Boss</a><a name="bookmark151">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business Day; Small Business</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Software That Helps Small Businesses Ship Like Amazon</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By EILENE ZIMMERMAN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">858 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16 April 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In his spare time two years ago, Jarrett Streebin operated a gift-card reselling business that required his customers to send their gift cards to him. He wanted to give them preprinted, prepaid shipping labels to make the process easy, but it proved more complicated and took longer than he expected.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That’s because trying to integrate with carriers like the United States Postal Service or U.P.S. required an A.P.I. key — a code used to gain access to an application program interface. Getting that code, he said, required time and paperwork because helping small businesses integrate wasn’t a core focus for most shipping companies.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.easypost.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">Tired of waiting, Mr. Streebin built his own A.P.I. and started a business around it, </a>EasyPost<span class="p">, which allows businesses to integrate with carriers like the Postal Service, UP.S., Federal Express and DHL.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To develop the service, Mr. Streebin talked to lots of small-business owners with e-commerce stores to identify their postage and shipping pain points. “They said it was really hard to integrate the major carriers into their online stores,” he said. “They were copying and pasting addresses to create labels because you have to manually enter addresses.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Their options were limited: They could hire a developer to integrate the services of carriers, which can be costly because it’s complicated. Or they could use an expensive software program. Mr. Streebin’s A.P.I. enabled the businesses to offer their customers address verification, rate information, customs forms, tracking and the ability to make a purchase.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">He started the company in September 2012 with a note about EasyPost that he wrote and posted on Y Combinator’s </a>Hacker News<a href="http://svangel.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">, a news-sharing website read by programmers and entrepreneurs. Hundreds signed up for the service, and David Lee, founder and managing partner of </a>SV Angel<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ron-conway" class="s1" target="_blank">, became one of the first investors, putting $200,000 behind the company (</a>Ron Conway<span class="p">, a well-known investor, is a “special adviser” to SV Angel). EasyPost has raised $3 million to date.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company launched a test version of its product in December 2013, and today the API is used to make “millions of shipments a month,” Mr. Streebin said. EasyPost, which has eight employees, operates on a subscription basis, with fees as low as $5 for 100 packages a month and running as high as thousands of dollars a month for high-volume shippers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Customers can print labels with EasyPost that include the address, postage and a tracking number. Although the aim originally was to create a tool for small e-commerce businesses, EasyPost now serves companies of all sizes</p><ul id="l6"><li><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">those with a few thousands dollars of revenue a year as well as those with hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Other than Amazon, Mr. Streebin said, “there are no companies completely optimized for this kind of shipping.”</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.rocksbox.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">One client, </a>RocksBox<span class="p">, is a subscription-based website that allows customers to “borrow” three pieces of costume jewelry at a time to wear and return (with an option to buy). The company has 12 employees and sends hundreds of shipments a day to all 50 states, said Meaghan Rose, founder and chief executive. About a year ago, Ms. Rose switched to EasyPost from a system she considered highly labor intensive. “We had to type in a destination address for each shipment we sent, which isn’t scalable, and we didn’t have tracking information,” she said.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RocksBox no longer has to weigh every shipment before sending it out and printing labels is now much faster, Ms. Rose said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of EasyPost’s more tech-savvy business customers develop their e-commerce sites around EasyPost’s</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.P.I. Others use plug-ins to enable integration, or they hire a developer. That costs little, Mr. Streebin said, because the integration is relatively simple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said his biggest challenge now is hiring enough developers to keep up with his company’s growth. “We’re in San Francisco, where everyone wants to build more software,” he said, “so continuing to find good people that are excited about this industry is a challenge. If I had an extra four engineers, I could build a lot more stuff.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company is looking to add carriers, offer same-day service and improve tracking updates through email, text messages and push notifications. “We do rigorous customer surveys and a lot of customer support ourselves, so we can see all the issues and keep a running tab,” he said. “We ask customers all the time, ‘Would you use the service more if it was like this?’ We listen to them and then we go build it.”</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://twitter.com/eilenez" class="s1" target="_blank">You can follow Eilene Zimmerman on </a>Twitter<span class="p">.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/02/this-week-in-small-business-meet-your-start-up-mate/" class="a" target="_blank">This Week in Small Business: Meet Your Start-Up </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/02/this-week-in-small-business-meet-your-start-up-mate/" target="_blank">Mate</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/how-pop-up-stores-are-spurring-innovation-in-detroit/" class="a" target="_blank">How Pop-Up Stores Are Spurring Innovation in </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/how-pop-up-stores-are-spurring-innovation-in-detroit/" target="_blank">Detroit</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/today-in-small-business-dont-turn-left/" class="a" target="_blank">Today in Small Business: Don’t Turn </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/today-in-small-business-dont-turn-left/" target="_blank">Left</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/today-in-small-business-etsy-goes-wholesale/" class="a" target="_blank">Today in Small Business: Etsy Goes </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/today-in-small-business-etsy-goes-wholesale/" target="_blank">Wholesale</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/a-non-techie-tries-to-build-a-tech-company/" class="a" target="_blank">A Non-Techie Tries to Build a Tech </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/a-non-techie-tries-to-build-a-tech-company/" target="_blank">Company</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Jarrett Streebin says his biggest challenge is finding developers. | EasyPost Document NYTB000020140416ea4g0018i</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_079.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark152">finance</a><a name="bookmark153">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Bookstores embrace Amazon</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By KIRK JOHNSON</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">990 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">15 April 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A love of books and bookstores runs deep in the sinews of this city, where gray skies and drizzle can drive a person to drink, or read, or both. A long-running annual survey ranks Seattle as America’s second-most literate big city, behind Washington, D.C., as measured by things like the number of bookstores, library resources, newspaper circulation and education.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon.com Inc. also calls Seattle home. And in recent years, as many small independent bookstores here and around the nation struggled or closed their doors, owners often placed blame for their plight on the giant online retailer’s success in delivering best sellers at discount prices, e-readers and other commodities of the digital marketplace.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘They seem to be after everyone and everything,’’ one Seattle-area bookstore owner, Roger Page, fulminated on his store’s blog last year. He added, ‘‘I believe there is a real chance that they will ruin the publishing world.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But now there are signs of a thaw in those tensions, at least here in the city that most embodied them. As Amazon has exploded with growth, hiring thousands of tech workers at its downtown headquarters and helping bolster the Seattle economy, local bookstore owners have seen a surprising new side of the company they loved to hate: Many Amazon employees, it turns out, are readers who are not shopping at the company store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘A lot of our customers work at Amazon,’’ said Tracy Taylor, the general manager at the Elliott Bay Book Company, one of the city’s largest independent booksellers. The store, about a mile from Amazon headquarters, last year earned what Ms. Taylor called the ‘‘first substantial profit’’ in almost 20 years, enough to even pay employee bonuses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whether it is Amazon or something else, the broader pattern is unmistakable, said Oren J. Teicher, the chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, a national bookstore trade group. ‘‘Seattle has become one of the most successful independent bookstore cities in the country,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tom Nissley, 46, a writer and former Amazon employee with 10 years at the company who lives with his family in northern Seattle, embodies this odd new détente. In his old life, he was a senior editor, helping Amazon promote and choose featured book titles for its website. Then, in 2010, he won enough money on the television quiz show ‘‘Jeopardy!’’ — about $235,000 as an eight-game champion — to quit his day job and write full time, publishing last fall a compendium of literary history and trivia, called ‘‘A Reader’s Book of Days.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last month, Mr. Nissley’s bookish-in-Seattle tale came full circle when he signed a contract to buy and run his own small independent bookstore. The shop, Santoro’s, which he plans to rename Phinney Books, is in a neighborhood, Phinney Ridge, with plenty of Amazon employees, many of whom Mr. Nissley knows as former colleagues or neighbors, and who he hopes will shop at his store (or at least come in to offer commiseration and advice). The purchase price, essentially the value of the inventory, was $35,000.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I think I know what I’m getting into,’’ he said. ‘‘I hope so.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The soon-to-be-Phinney is by no means a Goliath. At 1,200 square feet, and about 5,000 titles on the shelves, it is a retail space that might have once fit a five-and-dime. Glass windows open onto the street where other local businesses like Bluebird Ice Cream, Caffe Vita and Cornuto Pizza line the block.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Part of Mr. Nissley’s optimism is that he believes local shops have increasingly found their feet in how to avoid competition with Amazon, or other giant retailers, by offering services or products that only a local can provide. He plans to offer, in addition to books, a line of paper goods, toys and vinyl handbags made by the business that his wife, Laura Silverstein, started.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He is also convinced, he said, that the e-book revolution, which seemed ready a few years ago to sweep away the old world of pages and print, has reached a plateau. Publishers, wanting to keep independent bookstores alive, have also helped — easing traditional repayment rules for books, or helping with promotions or advertising.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a backup plan, he was hoping for some additional earnings from appearing on ‘‘Jeopardy!’’ again as part of a runoff of past champions, called ‘‘Battle of the Decades.’’ (However, he lost on the first day of the return tournament.) He is also finishing a novel, which he hopes will one day sit alongside his other book on a shelf at Phinney Books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The strength of the local economy and the shop-local movement underpins everything, as even Mr. Page, the bookstore owner, concedes, despite his Amazon-size fears. He co-owns Island Books with his wife, Nancy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘Amazon makes great contributions to the vitality of Seattle,’’ Mr. Page said in an interview. ‘‘They are putting their footprint right down in the middle of Seattle and they’re pouring a lot of money and energy into it, and it is one of several drivers that are making this a vibrant, interesting and expensive place to live.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And Amazon as a big local employer also means Amazon as a big producer of Amazon expatriates like Mr. Nissley with bookselling experience. Two of Island Books’ 10 employees, Mr. Page said, also once worked at Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Nissley said that some of his favorite memories of Amazon were the early years when employees at headquarters would occasionally be asked to pitch in at the warehouse, helping pack books before they went out into the world. In his new shop, he said, he will be going back in a way to that simpler time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">‘‘Maybe it’s an effect of living your life online — that you also want these physical things,’’ he said.

FRIEDMAN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,668 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14 April 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seventeen years ago I wrote a book, which you can find on Amazon and Google and elsewhere online. This is unusual only because my book was never published. It’s called “Goths,” fitting for a title that has left its traces on the Internet but does not exist. The traces themselves are ghostly. Other than the title, Amazon lists only the publisher (Random House Trade), language (English) and ISBNs (one with 10 digits, the other with 13). Google goes further by giving the publication date (March 1, 1998) and promising a cover image — but it turns out to be a placeholder. And unlike Amazon, Google neglects to mention that the book is a hardcover. Google admits, “We haven’t found any reviews in the usual places,” which in this case would be the planet Earth. “Be the first to review this item,” Amazon encourages, but has as yet found no takers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the Internet existed before 1997, I was not aware of it. I was an MS-DOS user and a visiting lecturer in creative writing; I had never heard of any email extensions other than .edu. I lived in Seattle with my boyfriend, an English professor, and I had a cappuccino every evening so that I could write into the night. I was working on a book commissioned by my old friend Ruth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We had collaborated on a project that began a decade earlier. Ruth, a children’s book editor at Random House, was a regular reader of my stories and perhaps the only reader of a manuscript I wrote in my Alphabet City apartment, among my first in New York. It was a sixth-floor walk-up with a cheese-stick operation on the ground floor. A byproduct of cheese-stick manufacturing is a vomit-like smell. A byproduct of living in Alphabet City in the late ’80s was the experience of being chased by some thug up all five flights of stairs and, on another occasion, having the fire escape gate pried open by a crook after my bag of pennies. That life was interesting, if not an outright thrill. One day a flier appeared in the front hall warning that bullets were being fired from the tenement behind ours. How alarmist! It’s true my room faced onto the garbage dump between the two buildings. But it was a bedroom, where one spends most of one’s time horizontal — any bullets would fly right over me.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I was horizontal in that room except when I was writing. Between desk and bed, the only pieces of furniture, was a passage just wide enough to squeeze my legs into. I sat on my bed and typed on my Selectric III. I was writing a novel inspired by Cormac McCarthy’s early work, his unheroic, unpsychological Southern gothic tales. My novel was about a deranged trucker who travels up and down I-95 looking for boys to pick up and throw into the freezer compartment of his big rig, where they stiffen in the forms of chairs and other household items.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ruth, cannily perverse, thought this would make a great children’s book. And so was born “Phantom Trucker,” the campy tale of a deranged undead trucker who travels up and down I-95 looking for … But he only threatens to throw our young hero into the freezer compartment, and he’s sore and intent on revenge only because he once swerved to avoid hitting a boy and ended up colliding with a light post. A hero! The book had a beautiful cover, and I showed up at bookstores as the Phantom Trucker, complete with glistening face gash, much to the derision of the older children. I enjoyed every second of this experience.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The book Ruth commissioned was supposed to kick off a new young adult imprint. She came out to do a photo shoot with a model for the cover. I put on black clothes and purple lipstick for my author photo. At the time, living in Seattle and all, I was into most everything goth, especially its literary touchstones — Keats, Mary Shelley, Nick Cave. I was given money — was I given money? — to write. Each evening I sat in my apartment, with its view of the lit-up Space Needle and the Olympic Mountains rising blackly beyond, and I wrote. I took a break to walk the neighborhood, burnished even at night by the world of my story, then came home to write some more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The plot, as I recall, concerned an impossible girl gradually abandoned by everyone in her life. She cracks up, and out of this freak show she emerges as a goth. Her severe new mask, erected as a barricade, allows her to</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">access and express a newfound sensitivity, which wins her friends and a boyfriend and entrée into the goth scene. A soap-opera plot inverted: only once she goes from haughty blonde to ghoulish brunette can she be reintegrated into the community. At some point on her journey she starts thinking in Cure lyrics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even Ruth couldn’t make anything out of this one. She had helped me with the first 50 pages, but I went on to write the next 500 on my own. Faced with this pile of high drama, Ruth retreated into silence. She didn’t seem to like the manuscript but couldn’t say why. This is the most frustrating, even painful, position for a writer to be in vis-à-vis an editor; she herself seemed agonized. We never spoke again. The entire imprint shut down before it could even be started.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I moved to Silicon Valley with my professor boyfriend, and we promptly broke up. When I surfaced I found myself swimming in a vat of money; my share was minuscule, but at the age of 34 I had joined the middle class. Silicon Valley 1997: right place at the right time for anyone in need of a life, or at least a job. I still didn’t know how to use Windows. But Oracle ended up paying me, along with a dozen other literary types, to sit around adjudicating what were to us the big issues of the day: Should homepage be one word or two? Is it a Web site? A web site? A Website? Did we dare even imagine a website? Good times, those.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Internet had come into existence for me — but I had no presence on it. Why should I have? What had I done to merit any notice? I had continued to write but published nothing other than a few book reviews in The San Francisco Chronicle. It wasn’t until years later, when companies had stopped hiring English majors as English majors and I had reinvented myself twice over, that it occurred to me to look for evidence of myself online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other than a notice of a real estate transaction I had been involved in, “Phantom Trucker” was pretty much it, remaindering across the Anglophone world for a penny. There were so many sites offering this book for a penny that it took me awhile to notice the skeletal listing out there also under my name. “Goths.” It had been published after all! And then I looked more closely. Before abandoning it, Random House had done just enough to launch the book into the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I’m tempted to be the first to review this item. Flesh out the listing, give it a description, rate it on Goodreads (where it already is present), send out so many tentacles so far into cyberspace that they could never be yanked back to earthly obscurity. Or if the manuscript is extant or the floppy disk unbent, publish the book myself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I sent another book into the world that is even more spectral than “Goths.” Just before I moved to Seattle, the manuscript of a novel I had written was chosen as the runner-up in the Associated Writing Programs Award Series in the Novel. That summer I received a handwritten note from the judge telling me that my book, “The Creek Is Gone,” would have won if the ending were better. More closed — she wanted to know what happened to the characters. (My professor boyfriend helpfully reminded me he had told me I needed to work on my endings.) All that I needed to do, the judge told me, was to keep on.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These words sustained me over the years, though not as much as a book contract would have — this was the prize for first place — or an academic position, which the person who won held the last time I checked. “The Creek Is Gone” never even got as far as having an ISBN assigned; no publisher was interested. The traces of this book linger only in my head. Ghostly book, ghostly life I might have had.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mais je ne regrette rien. “The Creek Is Gone,” and it ain’t coming back. “Goths,” too. As for my visible work, as Jorge Luis Borges would have called it, I had risked my life writing the book that became “Phantom Trucker,” sitting in my Alphabet City window. Wouldn’t it have been better if it had ended up as something approaching the quality of its model — “Child of God,” say — rather than as a kids’ thriller? No, the absence of “Goths” in bookstores is no great hole in the world. By not being published, this book stands a chance of being better than the manuscript, better than what work I have published. The “Goths” out there on the Internet isn’t the book I wrote; it’s the ideal form of one I haven’t yet written.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jason K.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A flaw has been discovered in one of the Internet’s key security methods, potentially forcing a wide swath of websites to make changes to protect the security of consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The problem was first discovered by a team of Finnish security experts and researchers at Google last week and disclosed on Monday. By Tuesday afternoon, a number of large websites, including Yahoo, Facebook, Google and Amazon Web Services, said they were fixing the problem or had already fixed it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Researchers were still looking at the impact on consumers but warned it could be significant. Users’ most sensitive information — passwords, stored files, bank details, even Social Security numbers — could be vulnerable because of the flaw.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The most immediate advice from security experts to consumers was to wait or at least be cautious before changing passwords. Changing a password on a site that hasn’t been fixed could simply hand the new password over to hackers. Experts recommended that, before making any changes, users check a site for an announcement that it has dealt with the issue. ‘‘This is a good reminder that there are many risks online and it’s important to keep a watchful eye around what you’re doing, just as you would in the physical world,’’ said Zulfikar Ramzan, the chief technology officer of Elastica, a security company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The extent of the vulnerability was unclear. Up to two-thirds of websites rely on the affected technology, called OpenSSL. But some organizations appeared to have had advance notice of the issue and had already fixed the problem by Tuesday afternoon. Many others were still working on restoring security.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because attackers can use the bug to steal information unnoticed, it is unclear how widely the bug has been exploited — although it has existed for about two years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Github, a website where developers gather to share code, some were posting ways to use the bug to dump information from servers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Finnish security researchers, working for Codenomicon, a security company in Saratoga, Calif., and security researchers at Google found the bug in a portion of the OpenSSL protocol — which encrypts sessions between consumer devices and websites — called the ‘‘heartbeat’’ because it pings messages back and forth. The researchers called the bug ‘‘Heartbleed.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It’s a serious bug in that it doesn’t leave any trace,’’ said David Chartier, chief executive at Codenomicon. ‘‘Bad guys can access the memory on a machine and take encryption keys, usernames, passwords, valuable intellectual property, and there’s no trace they’ve been there.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Organizations were advised to download immediately the newest version of the OpenSSL protocol, which includes a fix, and quickly swap out their encryption keys. It also meant organizations needed to change their corporate passwords, log out users and advise them to change their own passwords.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then companies began taking inventory of what they might have lost. But because the flaw would allow attackers to surreptitiously steal the keys that protect communication, user passwords and anything stored in the memory of a vulnerable web server, it was virtually impossible to assess whether damage had been done.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Security researchers say they have found evidence that suggests attackers were aware of the bug.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Researchers monitoring various ‘‘honey pots’’ — stashes of fake data on the web aimed at luring hackers so researchers can learn about their tools and techniques — found evidence that attackers had used the Heartbleed bug to gain access to the fake data.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Actual victims may be out of luck. ‘‘Unless an attacker blackmails you, or publishes your information online, or steals a trade secret and uses it, you won’t know if you’ve been compromised,’’ Mr. Chartier said. ‘‘That’s what makes it so vicious.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Chartier advised users to consider their passwords compromised and urged companies to deal with the issue quickly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Security researchers say it is most important for people to change passwords to sensitive accounts like their online banking, email, file storage and e-commerce accounts, after first making sure that the website involved has addressed the security gap.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Tuesday afternoon, many organizations were heeding the warning. Companies across the web, including Yahoo, Amazon and PayPal, began notifying users of the bug and what was being done to mitigate it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tumblr, the social network owned by Yahoo, said it had issued fixes and warned users to immediately swap out their passwords.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘This still means that the little lock icon (HTTPS) we all trusted to keep our passwords, personal emails and credit cards safe was actually making all that private information accessible to anyone who knew about the exploit,’’ the security team at Tumblr, which is part of Yahoo, wrote on its site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘This might be a good day to call in sick and take some time to change your passwords everywhere — especially your high-security services like email, file storage and banking, which may have been compromised by this bug.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document INHT000020140409ea4a00060</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_084.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark162">MACHINE LEARNING</a><a name="bookmark163">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Expressway to Amazon in a Box</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MOLLY WOOD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,301 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7 April 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CORRECTION APPENDEDOSTENSIBLY, the new Amazon Fire TV is a streaming media set-top box -- an Internet-connected device that lets you watch video from Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Crackle or a few other outlets and play games with or without a controller, which is sold separately.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In reality, the Fire TV is a small, flat, matte black Trojan horse intended to sell you even more Amazon goods than you already buy. I prefer streaming that is content-neutral, or that at least allows me to find the best deal. This is not that box.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That&#39;s not to say the Fire TV isn&#39;t likable. The packaging and the hardware are tidy, premium and elegant. With its design and $99 price, the device pretty clearly targets the Apple TV as its primary competition. The two streaming devices have similar designs -- and designs on your regular purchasing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The setup for the Fire TV is remarkably simple, although the package does not include an HDMI cable, which I find annoying, although not uncommon. The Bluetooth remote pairs relatively easily; mine was a little slow to respond until I walked around the backside of the box. It&#39;s still a smoother Bluetooth setup than most. There is no clunky entering of a code or anything like that; just hold down the &#39;&#39;home&#39;&#39; button on the remote or controller for a few seconds, and you&#39;re off.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is promoting its voice integration, which allows searches for content by speaking aloud. I like that the remote uses a microphone button to start voice commands, rather than just passively listening all the time. But that button has to be held down while you&#39;re speaking, which is unintuitive and easy to forget.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s the least of what is wrong with the voice search, or any search for that matter. Yes, you can use your voice to search for content on the Fire TV. But the box will return movie, TV and game results only from the Amazon catalog, even if you have downloaded and signed into other apps, like Netflix&#39;s.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You could argue that it makes (some) sense that Amazon would index only its own catalog. But the company noted that the voice search also includes Vevo, a site that features music videos and some musician-related documentary content. So the capability exists.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For movie, TV and game content, however, the Fire TV does not search across platforms at all -- or display other viewing options in its search results or show summaries. If a show is available to stream free via Netflix, you would never know it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For example, when I searched for &#39;&#39;House of Cards,&#39;&#39; all I saw were options to rent episodes for $2.99. Even though I had downloaded and signed into Netflix on the Fire TV, there was no mention of Netflix availability on the show summary, even under the tantalizingly named &#39;&#39;More ways to watch&#39;&#39; menu.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The same happened with the documentary movie &#39;&#39;The Summit.&#39;&#39; It is a $4.99 rental on Amazon, but when I searched for it on Netflix, I found that I could stream it free with my subscription.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Oddly, at least one Amazon search result noted that the title was also available on Hulu Plus; it&#39;s possible a more universal search is in the works but just not yet in place. In the short term, though, if you already pay for Netflix or</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hulu Plus and are tricked into paying again to rent a movie or show from Amazon, you will end up feeling like, well, a sucker.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By contrast, the Roku streaming media box (priced from $49 to $99) can search across multiple platforms, what it calls its &#39;&#39;top channels.&#39;&#39; So can TiVo, which is one of my favorite streaming media boxes because its integrated search includes live TV; on-demand sources like Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon; and even, depending on cable or satellite provider, on-demand results.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Fire TV features feel less than baked as well. Parental settings are available that require a pass code to buy or download movies, shows or games; but no content rating restrictions are attached. When I searched for Pokemon, the box recognized the name and sent me through to search results, where the first one listed was the Walking Dead game series. That is not a child-friendly outcome.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As for content, the Fire TV has less than Roku or Apple TV; there are no HBO Go or Spotify, which are big misses. The Fire TV has 180 apps in total; Roku has some 1,200.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to the need to hold down a button for voice search, other aspects of the interface are not entirely intuitive either, and they can be jarring. Title images are huge, and it is hard to see many listings on a page. Getting information like summaries or availability takes multiple clicks, and the visual highlights that signal navigation are overly subtle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I also wish voice controls were better integrated throughout the interface, for data entry, searching other apps or even navigation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire TV tries to stand apart from the crush of streaming set-top boxes by offering games. Possibly Amazon is positioning it as an alternative to the much more expensive PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, which are able</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">media-streaming devices that also, obviously, do gaming.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So far, though, the game selection is less than impressive: Deus Ex, Minecraft and Despicable Me are the titles I recognized. One exclusive game, Sev Zero, is included and Amazon promises more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The $40 controller is fine, although compared with those of the new Xbox One and especially the PlayStation 4, it is less comfortable and polished. My son tried to play Minecraft using it, and found it highly frustrating; when I tried it, I agreed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Fire TV, over all, is a decent effort that suffers from entering a crowded field. Even if the market for streaming media boxes is currently small -- just 8 percent of consumers in the United States own one, according to Forrester Research -- the competition is more mature, and not limited to boxes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Internet-connected or &#39;&#39;smart&#39;&#39; TVs offer similar access to streaming media without taking up an HDMI port or room on a component shelf. Google&#39;s $35 Chromecast, the darkest and cheapest horse in the race, lets you stream supported content from a phone, computer or laptop with almost magical ease.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I find that combining my smart TV (a Panasonic Viera) with a Chromecast for easy streaming of Netflix or YouTube is right for me; I have Netflix, Amazon video, Pandora or Spotify, and that is just about all I need. I have not seen anything in the Fire TV that would persuade me to buy it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nevertheless, Amazon has a huge reach and is aggressively promoting the Fire TV; if the company continues to improve the content, games and interface, the Fire TV could be an accessible entry-level device. But if I had to buy just one gadget to introduce someone to streaming Internet video, I would get a Chromecast or a Roku until the Fire TV grows up a bit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Correction: April 8, 2014, Tuesday</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Machine Learning column on Monday, about the Amazon Fire TV set-top box, misstated the voice search range of the device.

This week it took a big step toward a future in which shopping and video are tightly linked, perhaps even inseparable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Amazon has its way — and it did not become one of the United States’ most valuable companies by drifting with the current — even watching home movies of your sister’s adorable children or a friend’s crazy cat will become marketing opportunities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company began selling a device Wednesday that lets consumers watch Amazon’s extensive video library, as well as play a wide array of games on their television sets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Amazon has a vested interest in making sure it is present at every moment of possible consumption, which is all the time,’’ said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. ‘‘It wants to get into that television screen and start to build a relationship.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Fire TV is part of a multibillion-dollar effort by Amazon to move from selling goods produced by others, which is traditionally a low-margin business, to presiding over the entire process of creation and consumption. Physical formats such as books, CDs and DVDs are being replaced by downloads and streaming.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In books, Amazon has largely made this transition. It makes e-readers and tablets and then sells the content for them. Some writers produce their books exclusively for Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Video is much more competitive. Netflix, which began by renting the same DVDs that Amazon was selling, is the leader both in streaming video and creating original shows to feature on it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Streaming is the long-term future of video,’’ said William V. Power, an analyst for Robert W. Baird &amp; Company. ‘‘Amazon needs to capitalize on that. The prize is controlling much of the living room and a big piece of the economy.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire TV, which arrives after years of speculation, costs $99. In addition to content from Amazon’s studios, it offers programming the retailer licenses for an estimated 20 million Amazon Prime subscribers. Those customers pay as much as $99 a year for a membership that includes videos and shipping.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Fire content will come from established players like Hulu and Netflix. Another source will be homemade films. With a separate $40 controller, Fire TV can also be used to play games, including a version of the popular Minecraft.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘We’re missionaries about inventing and simplifying on behalf of customers,’’ Peter Larsen, an Amazon vice president, said at a Manhattan news conference held to announce the device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Larsen, speaking on a stage outfitted to look like a living room, said devices from competitors, which include Roku, Google and Apple, have three problems: It is too hard to search for content, performance is slow and unreliable, and the content is a closed system. He noted that Apple TV users could not get the full Amazon Prime experience.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among the enhancements promoted for Fire TV: a voice search function that allows users to say a name like George Clooney and see results instantly pop up, and a prediction feature that knows what you want and queues it up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is leveraging its position as a retailer to expand into new fields, something it has become very good at. ‘‘Because we’re selling millions’’ of set-top boxes already, ‘‘we hear what’s working and we hear what’s not working,’’ Mr. Larsen said. Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, was not present at the news conference.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dave Limp, another Amazon executive, dismissed all the new and old companies that will be duking it out with Amazon in the consumer’s living room.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘We don’t go at it from the perspective of who you’re going to compete against,’’ he said. ‘‘We don’t think of this as a sporting event where there has to be one winner.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But in a chart on Amazon’s site, where the company has already started selling the Fire TV, it made explicit comparisons with those competitors, whom it judged wanting. Amazon’s chart was immediately attacked for leaving out things that its competitors did better. For instance, Roku offers more options for live-streaming sports events.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consultants are already laying bets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The likely winners are Apple and Amazon, both of which offer entire ecosystems, are excellent at merchandising content and are capable of subsidizing prices and making up the revenue elsewhere,’’ said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps Media Technology Strategies. ‘‘The likely losers are Google, which has a poor track record in entertainment devices and is not very good at merchandising content, and Roku, which has no ecosystem or synergies with other devices or services.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For all the lure of new devices like Google Glass, Americans still spend four hours a day watching television. The dream of securing that audience has fired up many a technology magnate. Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Intel all have tried, with mixed results. No one has done for TVs what Steven P. Jobs did for computers, portable music players and cellphones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TV was on Mr. Jobs’s to-do list. ‘‘I’d like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use,’’ he told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. ‘‘I finally cracked it.’’ But then he died, and Apple fans have waited. Apple TV, a set-top box, is the leader in the field, but until recently Apple referred to it as a ‘‘hobby.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Amazon’s vision, the television becomes a supercharged home-shopping ecosystem.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Imagine,’’ Mr. McQuivey said, ‘‘I’m watching a Jason Bourne movie. He’s on the run through Europe. The movie pauses and lets you move into an interactive game with Bourne. Or maybe he goes through Vienna, and you always wanted to go there, so here’s how you could plan a trip or at least buy a book about it. Amazon will know who to offer these deals to because those people are already in front of it at that moment.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This was not something Amazon talked about much at the news conference, but Amazon is also not a company that gives away its secrets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One small clue to the company’s ultimate plans: Amazon is promoting an app for its box from a start-up called Magisto. It offers free automatic video-editing software that can reduce the three-hour movie you shot about your cat to something far snappier. The company says it has tens of millions of users, a small percentage of whom choose to make their films public.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Magisto has the potential to be a sort of YouTube for Amazon customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reid Genauer, chief marketing officer of Magisto, said he had no idea how Amazon would generate revenue from Magisto’s app but speculated that the metadata in each video could be automatically analyzed in the same way Google automatically scans Gmail messages and then advertises against them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘In the same way that I write, ‘I’m coming to see you in England,’ and then I see airfare ads,’’ Mr. Genauer said, ‘‘you could see how someone could use metadata in video to sell products. If I watch a lot of kitty videos, you would sell me kitty products.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CORRECTION:</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As published in the International New York Times</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An article on Friday about Amazon’s new set-top box to stream video, games and other entertainment to customers’ television sets misstated part of the company’s content offerings.

All Rights Reserved. Updated, 7:55 p.m. |</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nearly three years ago, Liberty Media had grand ambitions to acquire Barnes &amp; Noble, before settling for a big stake. Now it appears that the media conglomerate has had enough.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Liberty announced on Thursday that it would sell almost its entire position in Barnes &amp; Noble, the nation&#39;s last major bookstore chain, removing one of the company&#39;s major backers as it struggles to compete with Amazon and navigate the shifting landscape for books and media.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2011, Liberty had paid $204 million for a 17 percent stake in the bookseller. After the latest move, Liberty will have just under a 2 percent stake. The move disappointed Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s other shareholders. After Liberty&#39;s announcement, Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s stock dropped sharply, and by the end of the day was down 13.52 percent, trading at $19.12 a share.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The loss of a major shareholder is the latest setback for Barnes &amp; Noble, which has closed dozens of stores and has trouble fulfilling its digital ambitions. Five years ago, the company had a promising product with its first Nook e-reader, a device that quickly became a major competitor to the iPad from Apple and the Kindle from Amazon and grabbed more than 25 percent of the e-book market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the Nook&#39;s early promise faded as the tablet space grew more crowded and Amazon undercut Barnes &amp; Noble on price. Last summer, Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s chief executive and the architect of its digital strategy, William Lynch, abruptly resigned. Nook sales dropped more than 50 percent in the most recent fiscal quarter from a year ago. Michael P. Huseby, the company&#39;s new chief executive, said in February that it was looking for an outside partner to produce its devices in the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investors have been waiting for signs that Mr. Huseby had a plan to stop the bleeding. The company has eliminated close to 200 positions in its Nook division -- about a quarter of its work force -- through layoffs and attrition. Its offices in Palo Alto, Calif., where Barnes &amp; Noble engineers and designers had been dreaming up new Nook devices, have been severely depleted.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Its traditional bookstores have remained more stable, though core comparable store sales are drifting lower. Barnes &amp; Noble executives have said that the bookseller will close about 20 of its more than 600 stores each year for the next decade.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Liberty&#39;s stake in the company had been considered a vote of confidence by one of the media industry&#39;s savviest investors, the billionaire John C. Malone. But back in 2011, just before he agreed to invest in Barnes &amp; Noble, Mr. Malone acknowledged that it was risky making a bet on the bookseller.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It would be a bit of a flier for us, on whether or not Barnes &amp; Noble can play competitively with the likes of Apple and Amazon in the digital transformation,&#39;&#39; Mr. Malone said in 2011 at the Allen &amp; Company media conference.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both Liberty and Barnes &amp; Noble described the move on Thursday as one that would give the embattled retailer more room to plot its future. When the stock sale closes on Tuesday, Liberty will lose the right to keep two</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">representatives on the Barnes &amp; Noble board. Gregory B. Maffei, the conglomerate&#39;s chief executive, will step down, though Mark Carleton, a senior vice president, will stay on as a director.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;By reducing our preferred position and eliminating some of our related rights, Barnes &amp; Noble will gain greater flexibility to accomplish their strategic objectives,&#39;&#39; Mr. Maffei said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The investment in Barnes &amp; Noble was always something of an outlier for Mr. Malone and Liberty. Though Liberty continues to own a range of media assets, including the Atlanta Braves baseball team and a major stake in the ticket seller Live Nation Entertainment, the company&#39;s notable focus has been the cable television business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Liberty&#39;s investment in Barnes &amp; Noble came as the bookseller&#39;s Nook e-reader business showed potential. But after the Nook failed to take off, efforts to split off the digital business from the company&#39;s retail stores faltered and Liberty concluded it had little interest in owning a stake in a declining brick and mortar operation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retrenchment comes as Mr. Malone, 73, is trying to return to his roots. Last year, Liberty Media acquired a stake in Charter Communications, a regional cable operator. Charter subsequently pursued a hostile takeover of Time Warner Cable, the country&#39;s second-largest cable operator.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Had Charter succeeded, Mr. Malone, once known as the King of Cable, might have been on his way toward reclaiming the throne. But after months of pursuit, Charter was outflanked by Comcast, the country&#39;s largest cable operator, which swooped in with a $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though Charter lost out in its pursuit of Time Warner Cable, it may still look to acquire other cable assets, including the three million subscribers Comcast has pledged to divest itself of.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And in Europe, Mr. Malone is also on the prowl for cable assets. Liberty Global, which he controls, has emerged as the most influential pay television company on the Continent. Earlier this year, Liberty Global agreed to buy Dutch cable operator Ziggo, adding to its stable of European cable operators, which also includes Telenet in Belgium and Virgin Media in Britain.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Thursday, Leonard Riggio, Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s chairman, said that while Liberty had been a strong supporter of the retailer, the company would now have a greater ability to pursue unstated &#39;&#39;various strategic options.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Liberty&#39;s exit could open the door for Barnes &amp; Noble to be sold entirely or split it up, options that executives have been considering for some time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore in Pasadena, Calif. John C. Malone is chairman of Liberty Media, which is selling all but 2 percent of its holdings in Barnes &amp; Noble. It bought the stake in 2011.

I would love to break free of my Comcast bill but am not quite willing to give up watching tennis and cycling.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How, in other words, do I get more of what I want for less? On this question hinges the future of television and the companies that are trying to reinvent it. Amazon, for instance, will need to persuade Ms. Woodhead of one of two things:</p><ul id="l7"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She will derive enough benefits from Amazon Prime, which gives access to a video library, and Fire TV, which plays the movies on a TV, to make it worth paying an additional $225 on top of what she is paying Comcast, which is about $220 a month for Internet, phone and cable.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Or that Amazon is offering such a great package that she does not need Comcast anymore. She can then cancel its cable service and perhaps — this is Jeff Bezos’s dream — use the hundreds of dollars she saves to buy things on Amazon.</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In theory, at least, a set-top box should be pretty compelling when compared with cable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Instead of spending $80 a month for 500 channels of nothing on,” said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps Media Technology Strategies, a consultant firm, “you get to pick what you want to watch when you want to watch it.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But if it were really that simple, he added, on-demand entertainment would have already triumphed. There are two big hold-ups, though.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“First, on-demand TV is something that consumers don’t understand, because they have no experience of it. It’s like on-demand music services (Spotify, Rhapsody, Beats Music): great idea, but it’s a new consumer behavior,” he said. “On-demand music with full major label licensing has been around since 2002 but even now there are, I’m guessing, barely 10 million users of it in the U.S. Introducing new consumer media behaviors is very hard and takes a very long time.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He continued, “By comparison, cable is the same as broadcast – just more channels and you don’t have to adjust an antenna. And similarly, iTunes is just like a record store – except bigger selection and you don’t have to leave your house. (Ditto Amazon and bookstores.) Eventually one of the Internet video services is going to figure out continuous programming (think Pandora for TV) and that will make a big difference, but rights are a big obstacle to that happening.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The second problem is the one that Ms. Woodhead alluded to: Comcast is her Internet provider. “Cable companies are very slow in offering ‘bare’ Internet service because they know that once they do, their subscription pay-TV businesses will go into free fall.” Mr. Rosenblatt said. “Paying $80 a month for cable versus</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$8 a month for Netflix – it’s not quite an apples-to-apples comparison in terms of programming, but it’s pretty scary to pay-TV providers nonetheless.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What might help clarify this situation for Ms. Woodhead is the increased competition Amazon is bringing to the market. That will force all the players to sweeten their deals or at least be explicit about what they are offering. Who can give her the cycling and tennis she wants at a price she craves?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, I have no doubt, will relentlessly try to win over Ms. Woodhead’s heart. How much programming will it take? In my article, I wrote, incorrectly, that the service would make its debut with no sports channels. Fire TV actually has several, even if you don’t buy Amazon’s argument that channels like Showtime are sports channels because they sometimes show sports. Roku, by comparison, lists 66 sports channels, but then it cannot ship me headphones or popcorn the way Amazon does.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon says it will rapidly add more sports programming, and presumably other kinds too. This will cost a bundle. Perhaps that is why Amazon stock fell $8, or more than 2 percent, on Thursday.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/supreme-court-declines-tennis-channel-appeal/" class="a" target="_blank">Supreme Court Declines Tennis Channel </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/supreme-court-declines-tennis-channel-appeal/" target="_blank">Appeal</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/daily-report-in-takeover-bid-comcast-seeks-to-stay-ahead-of-changing-technology-landscape/" class="a" target="_blank">Daily Report: In Takeover Bid, Comcast Seeks to Stay Ahead of Changing Technology </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/daily-report-in-takeover-bid-comcast-seeks-to-stay-ahead-of-changing-technology-landscape/" target="_blank">Landscape</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/apple-and-netflix-dominate-online-video/" class="a" target="_blank">Apple and Netflix Dominate Online </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/apple-and-netflix-dominate-online-video/" target="_blank">Video</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/whats-really-next-for-apple-in-television/" class="a" target="_blank">What’s Really Next for Apple in </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/whats-really-next-for-apple-in-television/" target="_blank">Television</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/american-internet-use-catches-up-with-tv-use/" class="a" target="_blank">American Internet Use Catches Up With TV </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/american-internet-use-catches-up-with-tv-use/" target="_blank">Use</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s Fire TV.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CORRECTION APPENDEDAmazon is a retailer that makes and sells entertainment. On Wednesday, it took a big step toward a future in which shopping and video are tightly linked, perhaps even inseparable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Amazon has its way -- and it did not become one of the country&#39;s most valuable companies by drifting with the current -- even watching home movies of your sister&#39;s adorable children or a friend&#39;s crazy cat will become marketing opportunities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company began selling a device Wednesday that lets consumers watch Amazon&#39;s extensive video library as well as play a wide array of games on their television sets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Amazon has a vested interest in making sure it is present at every moment of possible consumption, which is all the time,&#39;&#39; said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. &#39;&#39;It wants to get into that television screen and start to build a relationship.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Fire TV is part of a multibillion-dollar effort by Amazon to move from selling goods produced by others, which is traditionally a low-margin business, to presiding over the entire process of creation and consumption. Physical formats such as books, CDs and DVDs are disappearing, replaced by downloads and streaming.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In books, Amazon has largely made this transition. It makes e-readers and tablets and then sells the content for them. Some writers produce their books exclusively for Amazon, happily living in the digital equivalent of a company town.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Video is much more competitive. Netflix, which began by renting the same DVDs that Amazon was selling, is the leader both in streaming video and creating original shows to feature on it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Streaming is the long-term future of video,&#39;&#39; said William V. Power, an analyst for Robert W. Baird &amp; Company. &#39;&#39;Amazon needs to capitalize on that. The prize is controlling much of the living room and a big piece of the economy.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire TV, which arrives after years of explicit rumors and intense speculation, costs $99. In addition to content from Amazon&#39;s own studios, it offers programming the retailer licenses for an estimated 20 million Amazon Prime subscribers. Those customers pay as much as $99 a year for a membership that includes videos and shipping.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Fire content will come from established players like Hulu and Netflix. Yet another source will be homemade films. With a separate $40 controller, Fire TV can also be used to play games, including a version of the extremely popular Minecraft.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We&#39;re missionaries about inventing and simplifying on behalf of customers,&#39;&#39; Peter Larsen, an Amazon vice president, said at a Manhattan news conference held to announce the device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Larsen, speaking on a stage outfitted to look like a living room, said devices from competitors, which include Roku, Google and Apple, have three problems: It is too hard to search for content, performance is slow and unreliable, and the content is a closed system. He noted that Apple TV users could not get the full Amazon Prime experience.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Among the improvements and enhancements promoted for Fire TV: a voice search function that allows users to say a name like George Clooney or a genre like horror and see results instantly pop up, and a prediction feature that knows what you want and queues it up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is leveraging its position as a retailer to expand into new fields, something it has become very good at. &#39;&#39;Because we&#39;re selling millions&#39;&#39; of set-top boxes already, &#39;&#39;we hear what&#39;s working and we hear what&#39;s not working,&#39;&#39; Mr. Larsen said. Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon&#39;s founder and chief executive, was not present at the news conference.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dave Limp, another Amazon executive, dismissed all the new and old companies that will be duking it out with Amazon in the consumer&#39;s living room.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We don&#39;t go at it from the perspective of who you&#39;re going to compete against,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t think of this as a sporting event where there has to be one winner.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But in a chart on Amazon&#39;s site, where the company has already started selling the Fire TV, it made explicit comparisons with those competitors, whom it judged wanting. Amazon&#39;s chart was immediately attacked for leaving out things that its competitors did better. For instance, Roku offers 66 sports channels. At the moment Amazon is offering only a few, although it says more are on the way.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since set-top boxes give consumers an incentive to cut the cable cord, Fire TV also puts Amazon in the sights of Comcast, the country&#39;s dominant cable system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consultants are already laying their bets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The likely winners are Apple and Amazon, both of which offer entire ecosystems, are excellent at merchandising content and are capable of subsidizing prices and making up the revenue elsewhere,&#39;&#39; said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps Media Technology Strategies. &#39;&#39;The likely losers are Google, which has a poor track record in entertainment devices and is not very good at merchandising content, and Roku, which has no ecosystem or synergies with other devices or services.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For all the lure of new devices like Google Glass, Americans still spend four hours a day watching television. The dream of securing that audience has fired up many a tech magnate. Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Intel all have tried, with mixed results. No one has done for TVs what Steven P. Jobs did for computers, portable music players and cellphones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TV was on Mr. Jobs&#39;s to-do list. &#39;&#39;I&#39;d like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use,&#39;&#39; he told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. &#39;&#39;I finally cracked it.&#39;&#39; But then he died, and Apple fans have waited. Apple TV, a set-top box, is the leader in the field, but until recently Apple referred to it as a &#39;&#39;hobby.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Amazon&#39;s vision, the television becomes a supercharged home-shopping ecosystem, no matter what happens to be on.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Imagine,&#39;&#39; Mr. McQuivey said, &#39;&#39;I&#39;m watching a Jason Bourne movie. He&#39;s on the run through Europe. The movie pauses and lets you move into an interactive game with Bourne. Or maybe he goes through Vienna, and you always wanted to go there, so here&#39;s how you could plan a trip or at least buy a book about it. Amazon will know who to offer these deals to because those people are already in front of it at that moment.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This was not something Amazon talked about much at the news conference, but Amazon is also not a company that gives away its secrets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One small clue to the company&#39;s ultimate plans: Amazon is promoting an app for its box from a start-up called Magisto. It offers free automatic video-editing software that can reduce the three-hour movie you shot about your cat to something far snappier. The company says it has tens of millions of users, a small percentage of whom choose to make their films public.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Magisto has the potential to be a sort of YouTube for Amazon customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We see a real opportunity to use television as a tool for personal storytelling and personal communications, as opposed to just broadcast communications,&#39;&#39; said Reid Genauer, chief marketing officer of Magisto.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said he had no idea how Amazon would generate revenue from Magisto&#39;s app but speculated that the metadata in each video could be automatically analyzed in the same way Google automatically scans Gmail messages and then advertises against them.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;In the same way that I write, &#39;I&#39;m coming to see you in England,&#39; and then I see airfare ads,&#39;&#39; Mr. Genauer said, &#39;&#39;you could see how someone could use metadata in video to sell products. If I watch a lot of kitty videos, you would sell me kitty products.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Correction: April 4, 2014, Friday</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about Amazon&#39;s new set-top box to stream video, games and other entertainment to customers&#39; television sets misstated part of the company&#39;s content offerings.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the last 20 years, big technology companies like Google, Amazon and Apple have revolutionized the way people discover information, find new products and buy goods and services, like athletic socks and airline tickets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet they have barely made a dent in changing the way people actually pay for things. Instead, the cash and credit card ecosystem has remained the status quo, even as Silicon Valley behemoths have upended so many other everyday experiences. Most online transactions are still paid for using credit cards.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Fundamentally, there&#39;s not been a lot of change in the way people have shopped and paid in the last 20 years,&#39;&#39; said John J. Donahoe, chief executive of eBay.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And it is with good reason.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Cash works great,&#39;&#39; said Jordan H. McKee, an analyst with the Yankee Group. &#39;&#39;Credit cards work great.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">New payment methods could start to gain traction soon, however. Some of the biggest technology companies are now making how they are paid a priority. Having a hand in how people exchange money, they are realizing, has huge potential to deliver profits -- and valuable data. At stake is not only billions of dollars in revenue, but also the ability to shape how people buy, sell and pay in the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If there has been one success story of a big technology company changing the way we pay, it has been Mr. Donahoe&#39;s own company, PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002. Outside of credit cards, it is the most-used payment system on the web, with 110 million active accounts on pace to conduct more than $200 billion in transactions next year. The business generates more than $6 billion annually and is growing fast.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And PayPal is racing to develop a mobile strategy allowing its technology to be used for in-store purchases.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Google, Amazon and others are trying to muscle onto PayPal&#39;s turf. Google and Amazon companies have developed PayPal competitors that already perform many of the same roles. Apple and Microsoft, for their part, have hundreds of millions of users who have given them credit card information for one service or another.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google has for the last three years been pushing Google Wallet as an alternative to PayPal. As with PayPal, users can link their credit cards and bank accounts with Wallet. When it comes time to pay for something on the web or on a mobile browser that accepts the service, users need only enter their Wallet user name and password, instead of a full credit card number, expiration date and security code.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And as with PayPal, the goal of Wallet is to take out some of the friction from online commerce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google may have a hard time getting many retailers to sign on. While companies like Toys &#39;&#39;R&#39;&#39; Us, Airbnb and Quiznos are accepting payments through Wallet, others -- especially big retailers that sell a range of goods -- are wary of signing on.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;There&#39;s a lot of retailers that are very hesitant to work with Google,&#39;&#39; said Mr. McKee, the Yankee Group analyst. &#39;&#39;Is Google going to turn whatever they can into competitive information? It&#39;s a red flag for a lot of merchants.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For example, a company that uses Google Wallet might worry that in doing so, it could be turning over valuable data on customers&#39; demographics and buying habits. &#39;&#39;Walmart holds on to their transaction data very closely,&#39;&#39; Mr. McKee said. &#39;&#39;But that&#39;s exactly what Google wants.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google declined to comment about Wallet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company viewed by retailers with even more suspicion than Google is Amazon. Its product, Login and Pay with Amazon, is aimed not so much at the Walmart.coms of the world as it is at the parking garages, restaurants and florists for which Amazon is less of a competitor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We see the payments opportunity as enormous,&#39;&#39; said Tom Taylor, a vice president at Amazon who oversees its payment initiatives. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re not talking about strict online retail, we&#39;re talking about trillions of dollars.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet while Login and Pay with Amazon has already signed up some marquee partners, like Gogo Inflight, Mr. Taylor acknowledges that Amazon&#39;s founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, has no reason to celebrate yet. &#39;&#39;He&#39;s probably a little disappointed that we haven&#39;t done a bit better,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon, and others, will most likely have their chance. PayPal will face increased competition soon, and just as there are many credit card providers and many banks, so too are there likely to be several companies providing online digital wallets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;There&#39;s room for many winners,&#39;&#39; Mr. Taylor said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The battle for the market is only just getting started. Only 10 percent of total commerce is done online. The rest still happens in the nonvirtual world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Mobile is blurring the lines between e-commerce and bricks and mortar,&#39;&#39; Mr. Donahoe of eBay said. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s going to completely change how people shop and pay.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As smartphones enable users to take their digital wallets into brick-and-mortar locations, retailers and payment providers are reassessing how online money and in-store products might interact.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Beyond just enabling e-commerce on the go, many smartphones offer in-store purchases with digital wallets like PayPal and Google Wallet, using near field communication, or N.F.C., technology. With the swipe of an Android phone, you can pay for diapers at CVS through Google Wallet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">PayPal has N.F.C. capability, too, and it, Google and Amazon are at the start of an arms race, each rushing out new features, like loyalty programs, rewards and discounted fees, that they hope will differentiate their service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Waiting in the wings are companies like Apple, which has the most credit card accounts on file of any company, with more than 575 million. Microsoft has information on troves of such accounts through its Skype and Xbox Live products. And Facebook, with its social graph of more than a billion users, could potentially transform its Credits product, which lets users buy virtual goods and a small range of services on the site, into a formidable competitor, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The market is still in such a nascent stage,&#39;&#39; Mr. McKee the analyst said. &#39;&#39;The foundation is still being laid.&#39;&#39; This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020140402ea420002w</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_092.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark178">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark179">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos, Please Call Your Office</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">232 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2 April 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s news conference on Wednesday solved one of the biggest riddles in technology — when would Amazon ever introduce one of the devices it has been endlessly rumored to be working on?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But it also introduced another mystery: Where the heck was Jeff Bezos?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This was Amazon’s biggest move in hardware since 2011, and might be a landmark moment in the company’s ambition to sell everything everywhere to everyone. So you would think the company’s founder, chief executive and biggest shareholder would be on hand.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Furthermore, Amazon’s other executives do not exactly have the stage presence to wow audiences. Along with everything else, Mr. Bezos is Amazon’s chief impresario and best salesman.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maybe he had to do his taxes. Maybe he’s strapping himself into his rocket ship and getting ready to blast off to somewhere there’s no sales tax.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I actually don’t know where he is,” Dave Limp, an Amazon vice president, told my colleague Jonah Bromwich after the event.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That makes two of us.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s other executives aren’t considered to have the same wowing stage presence as its founder, Jeffrey P.

It costs $99 and will stream Netflix, Amazon Instant (of course), Hulu Plus, Showtime Anytime, Crackle and Vimeo, and more to be named.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This announcement, as you may imagine, has led some people to wonder: “Who needs this device?”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">More specifically, who needs this device if you already have an Internet-connected television, otherwise known as a smart TV?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The answer is a little complicated, so let’s start with the market potential.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Numbers differ, but Forrester Research found that just 12 percent of the population of the United States has an Internet-connected television, and of those who have them, only about 70 percent have actually connected those televisions to the Internet. Just 8 percent have what they call an “Internet-dedicated” TV set-top box.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We definitely feel that all of those separate devices are kind of an interim step until these kinds of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Internet-connected features become standard in either the television or your DVR or your Blu-Ray player or game console,” said Jim Nail, an analyst at Forrester.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consumers are more likely to buy a streaming TV-set-top box like the Fire TV than they are to buy a new television to get Internet video features, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the last five years, many consumers have thrown out their old televisions and bought flat screens, but many of those purchases were made before “smart” capabilities were built into televisions, said Mr. Nail.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“So you’re asking them to throw out a thousand- or two-thousand-dollar investment and turn around and buy a new one,” he said. “I don’t think a lot of consumers are in the mood to do that in this economy, so a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hundred-dollar box is a much better proposition.”</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/12/internet-tv-sucks/" class="s1" target="_blank">Also, most smart TV interfaces haven’t </a>been very good<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwmoBmlkaGQ" class="s1" target="_blank">. Samsung has been redesigning the interface on its smart TVs and has run a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwmoBmlkaGQ" class="a" target="_blank">series of ads</a><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">showing off its capabilities.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But awareness of smart TV is still low, and televisions with Internet capabilities make up only about a third of the televisions manufacturers are now shipping — and they tend to sell at a premium. It could be several years before Internet-connected televisions mature into easier-to-use devices, and a few more years after that before they become standard in most homes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the meantime, Amazon is making a clever short-term play: a stand-alone streaming media device at a time when consumer awareness of getting Internet material on a television is slowly starting to increase.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition, they get people used to seeing Amazon when they turn on the television — which is often. That helps Amazon lead you into its vast e-commerce offerings. If you’re used to using the company first for books, then holiday gifts, then toilet paper and fresh groceries, then streaming media and movies, you eventually get used to the idea of using Amazon for everything.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“People spend so much time with TV that now you’ve got this big chunk of consumer attention, and there’s a lot of different directions to take that,” said Mr. Nail.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, Amazon hardly has this market to itself: Apple TV is probably the primary competition, with name recognition to boot, although Google’s Chromecast is, to me, the dark horse at just $35 and with a dead simple operation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/playstation-3-becomes-leading-device-408426" class="s1" target="_blank">Roku remains a competitor, and don’t forget about game consoles: In 2013, the PlayStation 3 was the </a><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/playstation-3-becomes-leading-device-408426" class="a" target="_blank">No. 1</a><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/playstation-3-becomes-leading-device-408426" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/playstation-3-becomes-leading-device-408426" class="a" target="_blank">connected television platform for Netflix streaming</a><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/playstation-3-becomes-leading-device-408426" class="s1" target="_blank">, with the Xbox 360 not far behind.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is promoting some gaming capabilities in the Fire TV, perhaps as a way to counter the consoles, which cost several hundred dollars more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the Fire TV is an interesting move for Amazon. Tablets with Amazon media on them were a start, but taking over the living room is a bigger job. The Fire TV will either help propel streaming media into the mainstream or get crushed in the stampede of streaming media gadgets. I’ll have a full review of the Fire TV in the next few days, so for now I’ll just say: Stay tuned.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Email: molly.wood@nytimes.com; Twitter: @mollywood</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/the-tech-bubbles-silver-lining-cheap-services-for-everyone/" class="a" target="_blank">The Tech Bubble’s Silver Lining: Cheap Services for </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/the-tech-bubbles-silver-lining-cheap-services-for-everyone/" target="_blank">Everyone</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/googles-bigger-cheaper-cloud/" class="a" target="_blank">Google’s Bigger, Cheaper </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/googles-bigger-cheaper-cloud/" target="_blank">Cloud</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/all-quiet-on-the-amazon-front/" class="a" target="_blank">All Quiet on the Amazon </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/all-quiet-on-the-amazon-front/" target="_blank">Front</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/amazon-web-services-gets-personal-and-pretty/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services Gets Personal and </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/amazon-web-services-gets-personal-and-pretty/" target="_blank">Pretty</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/tech-rivals-lay-down-arms-for-youth-coding/" class="a" target="_blank">Tech Rivals Lay Down Arms for Youth </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/tech-rivals-lay-down-arms-for-youth-coding/" target="_blank">Coding</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Peter Larsen, an Amazon vice president, announcing features of the Fire TV. | Eduardo Munoz/Reuters | Peter Larsen, an Amazon vice president, announcing features of the Fire TV. | Eduardo Munoz/Reuters</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140402ea420028m</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_094.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark182">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark183">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Cloud Computing’s Watershed Week</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">929 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">29 March 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

Rather, they were more like deals that were first hatched in late 2013 as strategic plays for the coming year. And, at the end of the start of 2014, the bets have been placed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of these, like the moves by Cisco, Microsoft and Intel, seem like efforts by incumbents to catch up with the times. (if that sounds like criticism, consider the alternative.) Others, like the announcements by Google and A.W.S., further develop cloud computing. The consortium deal tames its next step by establishing practices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What all of them do is admit that cloud computing soon will not be another business. It will be a part of almost every business, probably one that continues to grow.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What is surprising to us is how long it took,” said Adam Selipsky, vice president of marketing at A.W.S., the biggest company in cloud computing. “This is a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. We assumed from the beginning it was unlikely we’d be the only participant.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.W.S. began in 2006, and already takes credit for enabling the creation of businesses like Airbnb, which is taking on the hotels business; Spotify, doing the same to music; Dropbox, a challenge to traditional data storage; and Pinterest, which disrupts things like tearing pages out of catalogs and sharing them. With most everyone on cloud computing, there should be more of that, from AWS and other cloud outfits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Established companies like Netflix, Kempinski Hotels, and the Australian bank Suncorp have or are in the process of primarily running their business on A.W.S.

Phillips, the head of Infor, said his company is “essentially going all in” on a cloud-based enterprise software strategy, changing its compensation to sales people and offering to take all of a customer’s data over to A.W.S. from their existing computers for $55,000.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Friends don’t let friends build data centers anymore,” he said. That’s likely to become a common view, though companies like Cisco still back the idea that private computer centers will remain important for a long time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Selipsky saw the market changing from start-up curiosity to established practice in other ways. “We’ve seen a huge interest from educational institutions in teaching a cloud curriculum,” he said. “There’s demand in computer science and engineering departments in skills like building applications on inexpensive commodity hardware,” with abilities to grow globally fast.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That twinge some feel at times like this is akin to seeing the fences go up on the frontier, the record companies signing your favorite underground band, or the parents coming down to the basement party just when it was getting good.

A lot of money. In </a><a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1372612/000119312514112417/d642425ds1.htm" class="a" target="_blank">documents it filed</a> <span style=" color: #000;">for its initial public offering, the cloud-storage firm disclosed this week that it took in $124 million in 2013, but spent $257 million.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Its losses have grown substantially over the last two years because the vast majority of its 25 million users don’t pay anything for the company’s services. Box has hired an army of sales and marketing people in an effort to convert some of its free users into paying customers. Still, the company says it does not expect to turn a profit “for the foreseeable future.”</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2014/03/24/boxs-ipo-revenueexpenditure-mismatches-and-the-cult-of-growth-at-all-costs/" class="s1" target="_blank">There are two ways to think about Box’s finances. You could argue, as </a>many have<span class="p">, that the losses are proof we’re in an incipient tech bubble. Box’s I.P.O. is one of the most anticipated tech offerings of the year; it is widely seen as a precursor to a raft of offerings by other start-ups selling cloud services, including Dropbox. But if investors go gaga over a company that’s losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year, doesn’t it prove we’re back to where we were in the late 1990s, with soaring valuations for companies that don’t have a solid business future?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps. But there’s another, happier way to think about Box’s numbers: Whether or not Box’s business pans out, isn’t it amazing that investors are financing a company that is giving away 25 million cloud-storage accounts for free?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Box isn’t alone in its apparent generosity. Thanks to the high hopes and deep pockets of tech investors, a host of high-profile tech firms are now offering incredible business and consumer services at impossibly low prices. The trend is playing out across a range of industries, including business I.T. services, communications, media, payments, local delivery and e-commerce. And because these start-ups are exerting pricing pressure on established market players, even customers who don’t use their services might benefit from their rise.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is the silver lining of a tech bubble. If investors and acquirers keep throwing money into tech — at companies from Box to Dropbox to Square to Uber to WhatsApp to Postmates and more — we’ll get more great products at low prices. We might even get services completely for free, even if it imperils the companies offering them. So as long as you don’t make the mistake of investing in dubious tech dreams, you may be able to ride out the bubble to some pretty great swag.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/03/26/tech-ipo-profitability/" class="s1" target="_blank">Why are these companies setting their prices so low? They aren’t stupid, nor are they altruistic; they all want to make money someday. But many start-ups are in new kinds of businesses in which </a><a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/03/26/tech-ipo-profitability/" class="a" target="_blank">growth is considered more</a><a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/03/26/tech-ipo-profitability/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/03/26/tech-ipo-profitability/" class="a" target="_blank">important than profit</a><a href="http://recode.net/2014/03/26/levies-strategy-for-box-attack-all-industries/" class="s1" target="_blank">, at least in the short run. Box offers a telling example. The company </a><a href="http://recode.net/2014/03/26/levies-strategy-for-box-attack-all-industries/" class="a" target="_blank">believes</a><a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/03/26/tech-ipo-profitability/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a>it can be an important player in a cloud-services industry that will eventually be worth tens of billions of dollars. If that’s the case, then grabbing as much of the market as possible now, before other players do, makes sense — even if doing so comes at a steep cost for the next few years.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303465004579327001976757542" class="s1" target="_blank">Box may or may not be right about this plan. But it doesn’t have much choice about keeping its prices low, because every other player in the cloud-storage business is acting on the same profits-be-damned calculus. Dropbox, like Box, has also been </a><a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303465004579327001976757542" class="a" target="_blank">raising money at a rapid clip</a> <a href="http://googledrive.blogspot.com/2014/03/save-more-with-google-drive.html" class="s1" target="_blank">to finance a wild expansion. Meanwhile, huge rivals like Google and Microsoft are also pushing into the market with eye-popping prices. Google recently slashed the price of its online storage </a><a href="http://googledrive.blogspot.com/2014/03/save-more-with-google-drive.html" class="a" target="_blank">to $9.99 per month</a> <span style=" color: #000;">for 1 terabyte of space, from $49.99 a month. The end result for consumers and businesses: Thanks to all these firms clawing for a foothold in a future megabusiness, we can all get boatloads of online storage for very little money.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The price declines in cloud storage might look like a special case, because the underlying infrastructure in that business — data capacity on servers — is always getting cheaper. But we see similar price trends in other businesses being attacked by start-ups.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/the-other-big-winner-in-the-whatsapp-deal-your-wallet/" class="s1" target="_blank">Look at communications services. </a>As I wrote last month<span class="p">, Internet-based texting apps like WhatsApp have saved customers billions of dollars by providing a much cheaper alternative to carriers’ exorbitant texting plans.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WhatsApp’s rise forced carriers to slash their S.M.S. fees. Now Facebook’s acquisition of the firm is cementing those price cuts. Facebook has said it doesn’t expect WhatsApp to make money until it has billions of users. That gives the company several years to figure out a business plan — several years in which users can expect to get nearly free texts, thanks to Facebook’s largesse.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.google.com/shopping/express/" class="s1" target="_blank">Then there’s local delivery. In New York and San Francisco, there are many new firms looking to deliver food and other items at extremely low cost. I’ve become a fan of </a><a href="https://www.google.com/shopping/express/" class="a" target="_blank">Google’s Shopping Express</a> <span style=" color: #000;">same-day shopping service, which sends Googlers to local retailers to pick up items for you, at no charge. The service is so convenient I often order single items when I don’t have time to go out. There’s no way Google made a profit on my $3 baby shampoo order, or my $2.50 order of Hershey’s chocolate syrup. But as long as Google has money to burn, and as long as it sees local delivery as an important business that it has to defend against the likes of Uber, Postmates, Instacart and Amazon — well, as long as all that, Google is going to be o.k. losing a bit on my chocolate syrup order.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And that gets us to the granddaddy of profitless consumer friendliness, Amazon. For years, the e-commerce giant has made tiny profits, yet investors, expecting a future bonanza, constantly drive up the company’s stock price.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/01/29/amazon_q4_profits_fall_45_percent.html" class="s1" target="_blank">This is a fantastic state of affairs for consumers. Freed from the pressures of profits, Amazon is able to spend billions of dollars every year building huge warehouses that can ship us all our stuff in a couple days’ time. It is sending armies of trucks into urban areas to deliver groceries. It’s working on drones to ship you batteries. </a><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/01/29/amazon_q4_profits_fall_45_percent.html" class="a" target="_blank">As</a><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/01/29/amazon_q4_profits_fall_45_percent.html" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/01/29/amazon_q4_profits_fall_45_percent.html" class="a" target="_blank">Matthew Yglesias once wrote at Slate</a>, “Amazon, as best I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sure, there are hidden costs to all this spending in search of future growth. The bubble is fueling dislocation and yawning inequality across the San Francisco Bay Area. My no-cost Google orders are probably environmentally taxing, though no more so than if I’d run to the store for my chocolate syrup. And because lots of these start-ups are going to fail, you may be sorry if you choose the wrong one. You could lose your data, or your privacy, if your wrong choice tries to sell your data.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These are all legitimate worries about the bubble. But it’s worth keeping in mind that not all effects of the bubble are terrible. To the extent that tech companies are forgoing profits, it means they’re doing other valuable things with their money — including offering cheaper services, investing in future innovations or hiring lots of people. Or all three.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/googles-bigger-cheaper-cloud/" class="a" target="_blank">Google’s Bigger, Cheaper </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/googles-bigger-cheaper-cloud/" target="_blank">Cloud</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/did-big-internet-companies-handicap-start-ups-in-fisa-rule-changes/" class="a" target="_blank">Did Big Internet Companies Handicap Start-Ups in FISA Rule </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/did-big-internet-companies-handicap-start-ups-in-fisa-rule-changes/" target="_blank">Changes?</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/cloud-computings-watershed-week/" class="a" target="_blank">Cloud Computing’s Watershed </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/cloud-computings-watershed-week/" target="_blank">Week</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/tech-companies-release-government-data-requests/" class="a" target="_blank">Tech Companies Offer Update on Government Data </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/tech-companies-release-government-data-requests/" target="_blank">Requests</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/daily-report-u-s-eases-some-rules-on-data-disclosure/" class="a" target="_blank">Daily Report: U.S. Eases Some Rules on Data </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/daily-report-u-s-eases-some-rules-on-data-disclosure/" target="_blank">Disclosure</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Box’s I.P.O. is one of the most anticipated tech offerings of the year; it is widely seen as a precursor to a raft of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I.P.O.s by other start-ups selling cloud services. | Box, via European Pressphoto Agency | WhatsApp, which was started by Brian Acton, right, and Jan Koum, charges users a flat fee of $1 a year to use the service.

Yahoo and General Electric anchored the bottom of the list.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Glassdoor is a jobs listing website that lets employees anonymously rate their bosses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn, a social network website, received a 100 percent favorability rating with the employees, and former employees, who responded. His leadership scored the top marks in ratings for senior management, work and life balance, culture and values, compensation and benefits and career benefits. Each company on the Glassdoor list had 1,000 or more employees. The comments were mostly measured, though there were a few zingers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Weiner, for example, won high marks, with one project manager noting that the company “fosters productivity from a positive, fun exchange of ideas.” But another, a former associate product manager, curtly noted that the company “needs innovation.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In total, three of the top 10 executives on Glassdoor’s ranking were from Silicon Valley. Brad Smith at the financial software maker Intuit was ranked No. 7, with a 94 percent approval rating, and Mark Zuckerberg , at Facebook , came in at No. 10, with a 93 percent rating. The number of technology leaders increases to four when counting Larry Page at Google , who came in No. 11. Jeff Bezos , at Amazon, in Seattle, was in the middle of the pack, at No. 33, with an 86 percent rating from his employees.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Traditional industries claimed some of the top spots. Alan R. Mulally , at Ford Motor came in No. 2, and Richard</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">W. Edelman, chief executive of the public relations giant Edelman, at No. 3. Each received a 97 percent approval rating from employees.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">John E. Schlifske at Northwestern Mutual and Craig Jelinek at Costco both received a 95 percent rating, along with Paul E. Jacobs , who led San Diego-based chip maker Qualcomm before Steven M. Mollenkopf took over this month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even Wall Street bosses got some love. Lloyd C.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even for the world of globe-spanning computer systems, Cisco is going big.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Monday Cisco Systems announced it would spend $1 billion on creation of an &#39;&#39;Intercloud,&#39;&#39; which promises to bridge multiple cloud-computing systems open to the public -- like those offered by Amazon Web Services and Google Compute Engine -- the private clouds of big companies and specialty cloud services for business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cisco, the networking giant, is building out its own data centers for the system and says it will offer Intercloud clients a high level of security and reliability. It also hopes to enlist a dozen or so large telecommunications companies and services consulting companies as partners. Other money will go toward new technology and a specialized sales organization.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The idea is to let companies run their software applications both internally and on public clouds, with close management, security and geographic control. What remains to be seen is whether there is really much demand for such a service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The goal is a &#39;&#39;Star Alliance&#39;&#39; of technology companies, said Nick Earle, senior vice president for cloud sales at Cisco. Star Alliance is a global network of 28 major airlines. So far, Cisco has announced only one partner, Australia&#39;s Telstra, but it will announce other partners in coming weeks, Mr. Earle said. They will include &#39;&#39;market makers, big ecosystems,&#39;&#39; like IBM in business applications, Accenture in services or Verizon in telecommunications. None of these companies were part of Monday&#39;s announcement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One reason for the move, Mr. Earle said, was the revelations of how much the National Security Agency was spying on just about everyone. Companies have said the N.S.A. news is changing policies around the movement of data over external networks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Thanks to the N.S.A., there are lots of countries that won&#39;t let their data out,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Thirty to 40 percent of the workloads on an A.W.S. are on personal credit cards that bypass the information technology department. With the N.S.A., this has to change.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another reason was the realization that companies like Amazon and Google were essentially running their own systems, while there was room for more interoperability and open standards. Cisco is building its Intercloud on OpenStack software, an open-source, cloud-computing standard.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are two ways to look at this. On the one hand, Cisco is trying to meet a real need, in the face of both growing public clouds and an anxiety inside information technology departments that companies are losing control of their own computer networks, either through N.S.A. types or unauthorized employees.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the other, Cisco and the other big incumbents it hopes to bring into its Intercloud may be making a play for relevance in a world that has evolved beyond the systems they built. What a Cisco (or for that matter, an Oracle, SAP, Verizon and others) has to offer in this future is primarily a strong relationship with the past. That is no small matter to companies that have to manage decades of data and applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Whether this move is a rear-guard action or a forward-looking play, however, it&#39;s clear that cloud computing has become a very big money game.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Google’s cloud computing business has figured out how it’s going to come at Amazon Web Services: lower and simpler prices, predictable services and software innovation. Some of the price cuts are as much as 85 percent. Amazon is expected to soon respond with moves of its own.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the long term, according to the executive in charge of Google’s public cloud, Google wants software developers, both independent and within companies, to count on prices steadily dropping at a rate that roughly tracks Moore’s Law. That means a doubling of power per dollar every 18 to 24 months. Google also wants its cloud business to move from a series of different services to a single, comprehensive product that handles familiar business applications, new apps, and big back-end data analysis and storage jobs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We think if we win the hearts and minds of developers, good things happen,” said Greg DeMichillie, director of management for Google’s cloud business. “Simplicity will be a big deal – what developers like to do is to write code, not managing infrastructure or worrying about resource planning.”</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">The </a><a href="http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/" class="a" target="_blank">lower pricing</a> <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/amazon-bares-its-computers/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0" class="s1" target="_blank">and the predictability are smart moves, strategically. While Amazon Web Services has marquee names like Netflix and Shell renting its </a><u>sophisticated computers</u> <span style=" color: #000;">over the Internet to run businesses, there is a sense among many smaller companies that the Amazon service is a good place to get started, but it becomes expensive as a company gets bigger. For example, the business intelligence company GoodData was once an advocate of Amazon Web Services, but has moved most operations into its own cloud system.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“No one should ever say it’s cheaper to run this themselves,” Mr. DeMichillie said. A reliable drop in prices could also make it easier for companies to plan the creation of new products and services. Amazon Web Services has often cut prices aggressively, but in something of a scattered way.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At a Google event on Tuesday, Urs Hölzle, a Google senior vice president, said prices for Google Compute Engine, its cloud service for big workloads, would be cut 32 percent across the board. Prices for App Engine, its software application service, were simplified and fell about 30 percent. Data storage prices were cut 68 percent, in general, to 2.6 cents per gigabyte over various storage systems. BigQuery, a data analysis product, saw prices cut 85 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prices would continue to fall roughly in line with Moore’s Law, Mr. Hölzle said. That is actually an impressive vow; Moore’s Law is an observation about semiconductor power, but Google, Amazon Web Services and others offer increasingly sophisticated software, as well as hardware. Google has internal methods of creating and deploying systems, Mr. DeMichillie said, that make it confident it can make good on the pricing vow.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Our velocity can be made faster than the industry,” he said. As to whether anyone in Google had qualms about exposing its crown jewels, he said, “there is a recognition throughout Google that cloud is the next big thing.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is no sense of ‘No, not that.’”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The announcement was made at a Google cloud event in San Francisco. On Wednesday, Amazon Web Services will have its own event in San Francisco and may respond to Google’s moves with announcements of its own.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sustained users of Google’s cloud, as opposed to intermittent purchasers, would receive discounts of up to 30 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to the lower prices, Google added a couple of features, such as the ability for a software developer to rapidly look as source code, automatic updating of software that is in the process of completion, and minor code changes while viewing it with a browser, that can speed production of new software.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/technology/ibm-to-announce-more-powerful-watson-via-the-internet.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Future product announcements this year, Mr. DeMichillie said, will involve “batch computing, opportunistic computing – where you get 100,000 computing cores for a brief period.” </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/technology/ibm-to-announce-more-powerful-watson-via-the-internet.html" class="a" target="_blank">IBM and Amazon Web Services</a> <span style=" color: #000;">have been involved in similar initiatives.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google is also allowing operating systems such as Suse, Red Hat Linux and Microsoft Windows Server to be used within its cloud. This is considered a minimum necessity for many established businesses.

All Rights Reserved. People like getting their toys fast. They also like getting them cheap.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is gambling they care more about the first than the second.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The retailer told the 25 million members of its Amazon Prime program on Thursday that it was increasing the annual fee for the two-day shipping service by 25 percent, to $99. The new price takes effect on the renewal dates for existing customers, starting April 17.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is famous for squeezing its suppliers for a better deal. Working in one of its warehouses, according to numerous investigative reports, echoes ‘‘Les Misérables.’’ But the company is extremely solicitous of its customers, and takes care not to undermine their view that the retailer is at their service. That is why Amazon held the line on Prime for the first nine years of its existence.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What consumers want to know, however, is what a retailer is doing for them right now. After the fee increase was announced, the notion of a benevolent Amazon took a beating on the retailer’s discussion forums.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I have been a Prime member for many years and will not be bullied into paying more!!!’’ wrote one overwrought fellow. ‘‘This is RIDICULOUS!!!!!’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Others more coolly pointed out that they were now paying tax on their Amazon purchases as well as on the Prime fee itself. They said they did not watch the 40,000 movies and TV shows that came bundled with Prime membership. And they said the two-day shipping sometimes ended up taking more time, and in that case why not use the standard shipping option — completely free for those who hit a $35 minimum?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It was fun while it lasted,’’ another soon-to-be-former user concluded.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investors, however, applauded the news. On a day when markets fell sharply, shares in Amazon held steady. Wall Street clearly believes Amazon can improve its shipping margins, helping the fragile bottom line without letting the revenue miss a step.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maybe not, said Hayley Silver of Bizrate Insights, an e-commerce consultant.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Raising prices in retail is a really hard thing to do,’’ she said. ‘‘This fee increase makes Amazon a little more vulnerable. But whether any competitor can step up to the plate is another story.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At least one competitor quickly moved to secure some Amazon customers. ShopRunner, a network of retailers from Neiman Marcus to PetSmart that offers two-day shipping, said it would waive its fees for Amazon Prime members for a year. ShopRunner usually costs $79.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘People are a little upset with Amazon,’’ said Fiona Dias, ShopRunner’s chief strategy officer. ‘‘We hope a lot upset.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon blamed rising costs of fuel and transportation for the increase in the Prime fee, but Ms. Dias said the real problem was the cost to Amazon of all the content that it includes with Prime membership. Amazon has now moved into original programming, part of its continuing competition with Netflix.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Amazon is passing on the cost of video to a bunch of people addicted to buying online,’’ Ms. Dias said. ‘‘Maybe it sticks in their craw that they’re now being asked to pay more for stuff they don’t want.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prime members also get to borrow one free e-book a month, but only if they have a Kindle. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is a mega-retailer, soon to hit $100 billion in revenue with 237 million active customers. It has completely reworked people’s experience with books, and is trying to do the same with other forms of entertainment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Land-based competitors from Sears to Staples are culling stores in a way they would not if Amazon did not exist. The company’s ambition is boundless.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Yet it is never clear how solid its achievement is. Amazon might have rewritten many of the rules for retail, but at the end of the day it will still have to make a profit while pleasing customers. It certainly does the latter, but tends to skimp on the former.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This is a rational business move but atypical, because they usually seem to hate raising prices until necessary,’’ said Sucharita Mulpuru, a Forrester Research analyst. ‘‘I suspect the people they lose will be offset by some people paying more, some more wallet share in categories like grocery and a bunch of people forgetting to cancel.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which said in January that it was considering raising the fee for Prime by as much as 50 percent, does not release any data it does not have to, so estimates that there are 25 million Prime members are only a reasonable guess.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts at Piper Jaffray surveyed 500 current Prime subscribers in the United States, asking them how likely they would be to renew if the fee went to $109. Two-thirds said no, but the analysts did not believe them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Psychologically no one wants to pay more for something,’’ Gene Munster, one of the analysts, wrote in a Thursday report. He estimated that a quarter of the Prime base was highly sensitive and might rebel. That might cut $800 million, or about 1 percent, from Amazon’s revenue. On the other hand the increased fee from more easygoing customers would add $150 million to the bottom line, which for Amazon would be a lot.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document INHT000020140314ea3f000bz</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 2/Image_102.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark198">Technology; Personal Tech</a><a name="bookmark199">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Locking Up Amazon Deliveries</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By J.

To use it, you need to log into your Amazon account and<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref%3Dhp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=201117850" class="a" target="_blank"> search your local area</a> for any nearby locker locations. If you find one, add it to your Amazon address book so you can select it as a shipping destination. (Amazon Lockers tend to be big yellow cabinets found in grocery stores, pharmacies and convenience shops.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When your package is delivered to your locker location, Amazon sends you a text or email message with a pickup code. Once you enter the code on the locker’s keyboard, the compartment with your package should pop open so you can collect your goods. For security reasons, a different pickup code is sent with each order.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The service is free to use, but not every item Amazon lists can be delivered to a locker. Textbook rentals, “Subscribe and Save” offers or merchandise not directly sold or fulfilled by Amazon are among the orders that do not qualify for locker delivery. Some objects are too big to fit in an Amazon Locker, so make sure the item you ordered weighs less than 10 pounds and is smaller than 16.5 inches by 13.8 inches by 12.6 inches.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A New Home for Old Picasa Web Albums</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.
