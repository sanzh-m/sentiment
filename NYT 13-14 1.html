All Rights Reserved. The authors are uniting.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last spring, when Amazon began discouraging customers from buying books published by Hachette, the writers grumbled that they were pawns in the retailer’s contract negotiations over e-book prices. During the summer, they banded together and publicly protested Amazon’s actions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, hundreds of other writers, including some of the world’s most distinguished, are joining the coalition. Few if any are published by Hachette. And they have goals far broader than freeing up the Hachette titles. They want the Justice Department to investigate Amazon for illegal monopoly tactics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">They also want to highlight the issue being debated endlessly and furiously on writers’ blogs: What are the rights and responsibilities of a company that sells half the books in the United States and controls the dominant e-book platform?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Andrew Wylie, whose client roster of heavyweights in literature is probably longer than that of any other literary agent, said he was asking all his writers whether they wanted to join the group, Authors United. Among those who have said yes, Mr. Wylie said in a phone interview from Paris, are Philip Roth, Orhan Pamuk, Salman Rushdie,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">V.S. Naipaul and Milan Kundera.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It’s very clear to me, and to those I represent, that what Amazon is doing is very detrimental to the publishing industry and the interests of authors,’’ Mr. Wylie said. ‘‘If Amazon is not stopped, we are facing the end of literary culture in America.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon declined to comment for this article. But in an interview in July, Russ Grandinetti, the company’s vice president for Kindle, said: ‘‘Books are really home for us. That’s where we started. We care deeply about them. Helping books and authors succeed in a crowded world of digital media is very important to us.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even Amazon’s detractors readily acknowledge that it is one of the most powerful tools for selling books since the Gutenberg press. But how that power is used is increasingly being questioned in a way it was not during the company’s rise.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Take, for instance, the different treatment Amazon has given two new Hachette books on political themes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Sons of Wichita,’’ by Daniel Schulman, a writer for Mother Jones magazine, came out in May. Amazon initially discounted the book, a well- received biography of the conservative Koch brothers, by 10 percent, according to a price-tracking service. Now it does not discount it at all. It takes as long as three weeks to ship.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The Way Forward: Renewing the American Idea,’’ by Representative Paul Ryan has no such constraints, an unusual position these days for a new Hachette book.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon refused to take advance orders for ‘‘The Way Forward,’’ as it does with all new Hachette titles. But once the book was on sale, it was consistently discounted by about 25 percent. There is no shipping delay. Not surprisingly, it has a much higher sales ranking on Amazon than ‘‘Sons of Wichita.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to explain why ‘‘The Way Forward’’ was getting special treatment. A spokesman for Mr. Ryan, the 2012 Republican nominee for vice president, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Hachette declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A recent sign-up to Authors United who is not a Wylie client is Ursula K. Le Guin, the recipient of the 2014 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Toni Morrison, Oprah Winfrey, Ray Bradbury and Eudora Welty are among previous winners of the medal, given by the National Book Foundation during its annual awards ceremony in November.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ms. Le Guin, author of ‘‘The Left Hand of Darkness,’’ the Earthsea series and other award-winning works, will be presented her medal by Neil Gaiman, a regular attendee at the all-expenses-paid Campfire weekend for writers, where Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, will be the host. She has strong feelings about the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon-Hachette dispute.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘We’re talking about censorship: deliberately making a book hard or impossible to get, ‘disappearing’ an author,’’ Ms. Le Guin wrote in an email. ‘‘Governments use censorship for moral and political ends, justifiable or not.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon is using censorship to gain total market control so they can dictate to publishers what they can publish, to authors what they can write, to readers what they can buy. This is more than unjustifiable, it is intolerable.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Wylie Agency has about a thousand clients. Many have not yet responded to Mr. Wylie’s query about Authors United, because they are traveling or are inattentive to email. But about 300 Wylie writers have signed on, as well as the estates of Saul Bellow, Roberto Bolaño, Joseph Brodsky, William Burroughs, John Cheever, Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, Arthur Miller and Hunter S. Thompson.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘Every single response without exception has been positive,’’ Mr. Wylie said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Authors United, spearheaded by the thriller writer Douglas Preston, is in the midst of two efforts: writing members of the Amazon board individually in the hope that they will sway Mr. Bezos to take Hachette books out of the line of fire while negotiations continue, and drafting a letter to the Justice Department asking it to examine Amazon for possible antitrust violations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Any threat presented by these initiatives does not seem to have weakened Amazon’s resolve. The retailer has said that it was trying to make e-books cheaper and thus more affordable for all, and that publishers and writers would make up in volume what they were losing in margin if the prices were lower.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Confronting Hachette and its authors might incur some short-term public relations damage for Amazon. But if Wall Street feels that the suppliers have the upper hand, that could damage Amazon in a more vulnerable place: its stock market valuation. Amazon shares are underperforming the market this year, but its valuation is still</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sky-high.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Preston, the thriller writer, sent a letter to members of Authors United on Friday saying: ‘‘I had hoped our efforts would have resulted in some gesture from Amazon, which is well aware of the damage it is doing to the careers of several thousand authors. Instead, we have been met with disparagement.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The letter to the Justice Department is being written by Barry C. Lynn, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and author of ‘‘Cornered: The New Monopoly Capitalism and the Economics of Destruction.’’ Mr. Lynn said the letter, which is being prepared with the help of several antitrust specialists, would be ready at the end of the week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whether a viable case could be mounted against Amazon is a matter of debate among antitrust scholars. An earlier effort by Hachette to interest government regulators in a case did not go anywhere.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon had better luck. In 2010, it sent a letter to the Justice Department outlining a possible antitrust case against Apple and five major publishers that suggested they had colluded to raise e-book prices. How much that influenced the government is unknown, but the case became a reality.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The publishers, including Hachette, denied collusion but settled the case, saying they could not afford to defend it. Apple lost in court.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That acrimonious past hangs heavily over the New York publishing community. Few major editors or agents have spoken publicly about the latest dispute.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Everyone is scared to death of being accused of something,’’ Mr. Wylie said. ‘‘It’s impossible for two publishers to have lunch without a lawyer being present.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140929ea9u0003x</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_004.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark3">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Is Not Holding Back on Paul Ryan</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">844 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30 September 2014 NYT Blogs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

The retailer has been refusing pre-orders on just about all new Hachette books as a way of gaining leverage in its dispute with the publisher over e-book terms.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is a very effective weapon. Pre-orders show the accumulating interest in a new title and help the publisher gauge the size of the print run. If pre-orders are strong, they put the book on the bestseller list in its first week, which could give it enough momentum to stay there for a while.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After “The Way Forward” became officially available Aug. 19, there was another problem. It was not easy to find the book on the retailer’s site. The only thing that came up was the audio book. A glitch, perhaps – although it seems to happen to other Hachette books as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000303761" class="a" target="_blank">Any author is going to be a little annoyed if the country’s largest bookseller appears reluctant to sell his book. So when Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, appeared on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Aug. 20, </a><a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000303761" class="s1" target="_blank">he seemed peeved at</a><a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000303761" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000303761" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon</a><a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000303761" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000303761" target="_blank">.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“As a congressman I have to watch what I say,” he said. But he went on to call the bookseller’s actions “a very frustrating thing” and added that “clearly Amazon is making kind of a power play here.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Is Amazon a monopoly?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I don’t know the answer to that question,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He might not be a fan of regulation, but should something be done here?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“If I were just a private citizen I would voice one straight opinion,” he began, but noted again that he was a member of Congress.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Was Amazon listening? At right about that moment, the retailer suddenly began treating Mr. Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, much better. Customers could suddenly find his book. It was fully discounted. And they could get it immediately.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Amazon prices books is a mystery. It does not explain its pricing policies, and a spokeswoman declined to comment for this post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In general, though, new books seem discounted more than older books, while the most popular books have the highest discounts. Presumably this is because Amazon wants to remain competitive on books the buyer is likely to see in Barnes &amp; Noble or an independent shop.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With the new Hachette hardcovers — paperbacks and older books seem to follow other rules — Amazon has largely reversed its usual formula. It barely discounts the books at all, and takes as long as five weeks to ship them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But a few books fare better.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For instance, “13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi” and “How Google Works” are among the top 100 sellers on Amazon. Although they are Hachette books, they ship immediately and are heavily discounted.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So Amazon is selling the bestsellers and delaying everything else? But this is not what is happening either.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://amzn.to/10gtBto" class="a" target="_blank">Sandra Brown’s novel </a><a href="http://amzn.to/10gtBto" class="s1" target="_blank">“Mean Streak,”</a> <a href="http://amzn.to/1rzzMDj" class="a" target="_blank">which was published by another Hachette imprint, Grand Central, on the same day as “The Way Forward,” is delayed for as long as two weeks, Amazon says.

But as he awaits the birth of his first child, Mr. Schulman personally remains a devoted Amazon customer. “Do I like it when I press Buy?” he asked. “It does bother me. It’s a split brain thing.

The show breaks new ground in its portrayal of a central transgender character. “If Laverne Cox’s character in ‘Orange Is the New Black’ was the first promising step towards a better depiction of trans-people on television, then this is the second,” </a><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/transparent-amazon-studios-review-a-truly-great-transgender-drama-9760547.html" class="s1" target="_blank">writes</a> <span style=" color: #000;">Ellen E.

But Ms. Liebegott wonders if a cisgender male actor (Mr. Tambor) can “be enough of a first stepping stone for transwomen who’ve waited forever for any kind of representation? Could a transphobe somewhere see this show and feel something shift? With four new shows with trans content, will cisgender people pepper their scripts with trans characters to sell scripts? The thought of that makes me want to crawl back in bed.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/26/jeffrey-tambor-transparent-interview" class="a" target="_blank">It’s a concern Mr. Tambor shares. In his research for the role, he spent an evening out at Oxwood Inn, a transgender nightclub in Los Angeles. “First they came to the hotel and we talked and did the metamorphosis with the wig and the makeup,” he recalls in </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">an interview with Hadley Freeman at The Guardian</span>. “And I don’t think I’ve ever been so scared in my life as I was when I walked through the hotel as a woman. It was an epiphany, because I realized, this is how Maura feels every day in her life.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Tambor was born in San Francisco,” Ms. Freedman reports, “raised conservative Jewish but grew up in what he describes as ‘a liberal environment.’” Nevertheless, he told her he was ignorant about transgender people “with a capital IG.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“So I went in with my eyes wide open,” he said.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">What makes “Transparent” doubly special</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iXYgtIYCTg" class="a" target="_blank">, in the eyes of Brian Lowry at Variety, is that it “takes an idea that feels pretty well played out” — family comedy-drama in the vein of “Parenthood” or “Brothers and Sisters” — yet “invigorates it not through a gimmick but rather via strong writing and performances.” And while Amazon has previously released a few well-received web series (</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iXYgtIYCTg" class="s1" target="_blank">“Alpha House”</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X89Oteb3kWw" class="a" target="_blank">and </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">“Betas”</span><span style=" color: #000;">), “Transparent” confirms a growing consensus in Hollywood: that “Amazon has the goods to become a serious player in the premium programming game.”</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/will-transparent-save-amazon-netflix-hbo-may-feel-heat-acclaimed-new-original-series-1676352" class="a" target="_blank">“Transparent” is “among five new original series Amazon is rolling out in the coming months,” </a><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/will-transparent-save-amazon-netflix-hbo-may-feel-heat-acclaimed-new-original-series-1676352" class="s1" target="_blank">reports</a> <span style=" color: #000;">Zoe Mintz for International Business Times. “The original shows are a long way from Amazon Prime Video’s beginnings in 2011 where the service had about 5,000 titles in its library compared with more than 40,000 today. The subscription service is tied to Amazon Prime, a $99 annual membership that allows consumers to receive free two-day shipping on certain products and unlimited access to its TV and movie library.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s development executives are clearly gunning for Netflix, which currently leads the market in high-end web series production. Shows like “House of Cards” and “Orange Is the New Black,” in addition to a successful reboot of “Arrested Development” (also starring Mr. Tambor), made the company over $1 billion last quarter and earned it 31 Emmy nominations. Though, “while Netflix still remains the big name in the streaming business, data shows that users are open to other brands,” Ms. Mintz writes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://time.com/3256184/transparent-amazon-best-fall-tv/" class="a" target="_blank">It looks as if “Transparent” may open the lanes up to Amazon.

Now the plan has attracted Brian Valentine, a prominent engineer and executive who worked for years at Microsoft and Amazon.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Valentine recently joined Ivy as a managing principal, where he intends to help form the teams that will turn the firm’s ideas into products and companies. Ivy Softworks is the brainchild of Jordan Ritter, a serial entrepreneur who co-founded Napster, the once-popular music service that ran into legal trouble.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Start-up incubators are not a new concept, of course. Traditional venture capital firms often employ “entrepreneurs in residence” to create fledgling companies. Mr. Ritter and Mr. Valentine said their singular priority was to hire entrepreneurial engineers, even if they do not come to Ivy with well-formulated start-up ideas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We tend to think about people first,” Mr. Valentine said in a recent interview in Ivy’s offices in a brick-walled loft in this city’s Pioneer Square neighborhood, “Incubators tend to think about products first.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ritter’s catchphrase for Ivy is “innovation studio.” It was born last year from seeing his initial start-up teams disintegrate and scatter to the winds as the companies matured. The older his start-ups became, the more they naturally began to focus on executing on sales and development plans rather than innovating, which was less satisfying to the founding teams, Mr. Ritter said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ritter said he found the separation particularly painful because he had moved a lot as a child and does not have much family. “When I built companies, I was building my families,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ivy is attempting to solve the problem by giving its employees the ability to work on early stage projects then shift to new, unrelated projects as their previous efforts ripen into start-ups. The employees receive equity in any projects they work on, as they would in traditional start-up environments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ivy is working on several projects that Mr. Ritter wouldn’t discuss, except to say that they are in the area of “productivity and collaboration tools.” Mr. Ritter said Ivy was well-funded by prominent Seattle-area investors, including individuals and institutions, though he declined to name them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The investors wanted Ivy to be near them in Seattle. Mr. Ritter said. He said he also prefers Seattle to the more crowded, aggressive start-up culture of San Francisco, where he was previously based.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I feel a city in its ascendancy,” he said of Seattle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Mr. Valentine left Amazon in early 2014, he intended to retire and travel the world. Amazon’s chief executive recruited Mr. Valentine to the company in 2006, where he led the development of its e-commerce platform.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For 19 years before that, Mr. Valentine was one of the top engineering leaders at Microsoft, helping to introduce its blockbuster Exchange messaging product and leading Windows development for years. Mr. Valentine said he changed his retirement plans after hearing Mr. Ritter’s pitch for Ivy.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">”The more I talked to him, the more I became super-excited,” he said.

She discusses the challenge of tracking down Ms. Beshara, who served a prison term for her role in running the illegal site, and of describing a culture with a different understanding of copyright law.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I can’t quite remember first time I saw NinjaVideo — maybe late 2008 or early 2009, not long after it launched — but I definitely remember my reaction: I was in total awe. The site was so flagrantly illegal, it felt almost anarchist and borderline punk rock — there was just such a total disregard for copyright law that I remember thinking, “How is this site still up?” Of course, that question was answered in 2010 when the federal government shut it down.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But while it lived, it was a marvel of technology because it just worked.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While it was live, Damon Darlin, my editor at the time, encouraged me to find out who was behind it, but the idea got lost in the shuffle of daily responsibilities and assignments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then the site and its founders got raided, and the tech press jumped all over the story. I kicked myself for not looking into it sooner, and obsessively followed all the news about the case and proceedings as they progressed. Other journalists, including Natasha Tiku at The Observer, Ernesto at TorrentFreak — a blog that follows news about piracy — and The American Prospect took up the story, but I felt like there would still be room to revisit it a few years later to gauge whether the government’s decision — to lock up a bunch of 20-something kids for running an illegal streaming site — had effectively achieved its goal of snuffing out illegal downloading online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I first reached out to Ms. Beshara, one of the figures behind the site, in June 2013. She had recently been released from prison and I emailed Ernesto, of TorrentFreak, to see if he could put me in touch. A few days later, I heard from Candee, one of the site’s former moderators, and she said Ms. Beshara wouldn’t be able to talk to me until she had completed the home detention portion of her sentence. I waited a few months, and finally, in October, Ms. Beshara emailed me. It took another few months to actually talk — we Skyped while she worked in a coffee shop co-op as part of her court-ordered community service — and I was struck by how familiar she seemed; how much she could have been someone I knew or interacted with. I only wish I had also been able to interview the technical administrators behind the site, but I was not able to connect with them before the piece ran.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Writing about something as controversial as online piracy, particularly at a moment when the company I work for is navigating the transition to a subscription-based business model, is a challenge unto itself. It’s an area that many people passionate about — as evidenced by all the comments we received on the story. I tried to get readers — particularly older readers and those who work in the entertainment business — to understand a perspective that is so unlike their own and instead see it as a reflection of the world we now live in. I wanted them to question whether the laws are nuanced and complex enough to address the changes they govern. I’m not sure I was entirely successful!</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I am familiar with the world Ms. Beshara and her cohorts inhabited. I came of age before Netflix/Hulu/iTunes were in full effect and when illegal streaming networks like Napster, Demonoid and Kazaa were proto-social networks. Talking about the music you were downloading was an icebreaker; it was part of the social fabric in high school and college. Even after those services got shut down, I noticed that the habits remained. Friends of mine share their Amazon, Netflix and HBO login information freely and loan each other their Kindles so they can read the books on them. It’s endlessly fascinating to observe how our views about sharing, digital property and ownership evolve, and the relationship between consumers and the law and copyright owners is endlessly fascinating.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I now pay for nearly all the content I consume, but I never lost interest in that world and the people who operate in it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140930ea9u002eg</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_008.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark10">Advertising</a><a name="bookmark11">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business Day; Media</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">A Winning Start Whets Appetites at Advertising Week</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By STUART ELLIOTT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">900 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">30 September 2014 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014.

This time, the title of the discussion, “Winning,” was meant to suggest that success on Madison Avenue could be just as rewarding — and elusive — as success on a field, pitch or gridiron.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/business/media/using-sponsored-content-to-keep-viewers-watching.html" class="a" target="_blank">During a discussion of branded content, also known as content marketing or </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">sponsored content</span>, Mr. Sorrell asked the panelists whether brands ought to create their own content or sponsor content created by media companies. Lisa Utzschneider, global vice president for advertising sales at Amazon, replied, “It should be a combination of both,” citing a program for a marketer, Nissan, that does not sell products on Amazon.com but advertises on the site to help send car shoppers to dealers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/amazon-tops-list-google-s-25-biggest-search-advertisers/294922/" class="a" target="_blank">Mr. Sorrell tweaked Ms. Utzschneider about her employer’s might and about its secretive ways. When he declared, echoing </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">recent news reports</span><a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/amazon-sponsored-links-seen-direct-threat-google-adwords-159713" class="a" target="_blank">, that Amazon was the largest buyer of search ads on Google, she replied, “That’s your data.” And when he asked about other reports that Amazon was planning to develop its own software for placing ads online, competing against a Google product called </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Google AdWords</span>, Ms. Utzschneider said, “I can’t comment on that.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Sorrell said, “I’m not doing it to be mischievous,” and rephrased the question. After receiving a general type of reply from Ms. Utzschneider, he said cheerfully, “I think I should give up.”</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en.html" class="a" target="_blank">Branded content was the focus of another session on Monday, featuring executives from two food chains, </a><a href="http://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Dunkin’</a><a href="http://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en.html" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Donuts</a><a href="http://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en.html" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.chilis.com/EN/Pages/home.aspx" class="a" target="_blank">and </a><a href="http://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Chili’s</a><a href="http://www.hhcc.com/" class="a" target="_blank">, and from their creative agency, </a><a href="http://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Hill Holliday</a><a href="http://www.tntdrama.com/shows/on-the-menu.html%23on-the-menu.html?&amp;_suid=14120241267350009055926857836793" class="a" target="_blank">.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">John Rossman, an executive at Amazon in the early 2000s, has written &#39;&#39;The Amazon Way,&#39;&#39; about the 14 leadership principles that drive the retailer, including obsessing over the customer, hiring and developing the best, and practicing frugality.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The relatively brief book, which was published through Amazon&#39;s self-publishing platform, discusses how these rules can benefit any company -- should it be brave enough to put them into effect. &#39;&#39;None of the 14 principles mentions the need for a healthy work-life balance,&#39;&#39; the author notes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Rossman, now a managing director at Alvarez &amp; Marsal, a consulting firm in New York, recounts a meeting with Jeff Bezos when the Amazon founder gazed toward Microsoft&#39;s campus and said, &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t want this place to become a country club.&#39;&#39; Mr. Bezos added that if Amazon became like Microsoft, &#39;&#39;we would die.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Twenty years after it was founded, Amazon seems at little risk of becoming complacent. But Mr. Rossman is alert to the flip side of the issue: How do you become the biggest company in the world -- something that is clearly Amazon&#39;s goal, whether it be measured in revenue or market capitalization -- without being so aggressive that it creates regulatory or public relations problems?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Following are excerpts from two conversations with Mr. Rossman. They have been edited for clarity. Q.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What is your take on Amazon&#39;s long-running effort to get Hachette, the fourth-biggest publisher, to lower its e-book margins? Why is winning this battle so very important for Amazon?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The deal that Amazon gets from Hachette will set a benchmark for other deals with publishers. When you&#39;re in a scenario like this, you&#39;re really careful with the first deal because it will implicate all the additional partners and vendors you&#39;re going to negotiate with.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Also, look at the incredible capital investment spree that Amazon is on. It&#39;s under a lot of pressure to create more margin in areas that are already at maturity. They are looking for every dollar they can to feed into their other businesses. And then they have their long-term goal of taking out the middleman, allowing the content producers to put their work directly into the customer&#39;s hands.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon has issued several statements, but in general is trying to remain quiet about this dispute. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There has been a long history of topics and investments and initiatives that Amazon has been comfortable either not explaining or taking some negative press on. One of Jeff&#39;s great quotes is, &#39;&#39;You have to be willing to be misunderstood for a long period of time.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">What are the potential pitfalls in Amazon&#39;s Hachette strategy? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes in these negotiations, you have to be careful in squeezing so much out of your vendor that they don&#39;t have a viable business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">In general, Amazon has a reputation of being very tough with competitors as well as suppliers. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has a willingness to aggressively compete on margin. It is able to have a race to the bottom that most other companies don&#39;t want to have.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s one of the ways in which this is a company unlike any other. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They operate without the kind of constraints that hold down so many other companies. The mandate of the organization, to explore and invent, gives them a good shot at coming up with new things. The business that Amazon is in today, the things they do to delight their customers, will change. In 10 years, they will be in new businesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You mention that the philosophy is that every new hire in Amazon should say in five years that &#39;&#39;I&#39;m glad I got hired when I did, because I wouldn&#39;t get hired now.&#39;&#39; And that the kiss of death there is being known as a &#39;&#39;solid guy.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are tension and demands that go far beyond other employers. Amazon believes in internal competition. It&#39;s very Darwinian. They believe in small teams versus bureaucratic control. But if you want to build things and launch products, you can. If you want to have a simple job, one where you don&#39;t look for improvements, it&#39;s going to torture you.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The message of your book is that other companies can learn from Amazon -- they can be faster, smarter, more aggressive. But can Amazon be too Amazon? What are the risks in following these principles?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They have always seen themselves as a scrappy start-up, where you have to eke out every percent of margin and there is a lose-win proposition in every negotiation. They are going to have to adjust their M.O. and get savvier from a P.R. standpoint. All of this is within their reach but it&#39;s not going to be easy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Competitors and other foes are waiting for it to stumble. What could prompt a significant setback? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Customer trust is at the center of everything they do, so if there were a major data breach that would be worrisome. Then there is the issue of keeping employees hungry and avoiding bureaucracy. Amazon employees are paid relatively little. All the upside is in the stock. If the stock is flat to negative for a long period of time, that is going to make it a challenge to retain top talent. Amazon is also getting to a size where it is starting to see the attention of unions and regulators.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Another way Amazon is different is that they actually encourage people to quit. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some companies say, &#39;&#39;We need to decrease employee turnover&#39;&#39; but Amazon is very comfortable with it. They don&#39;t want you to settle in, to slow down. Bringing in new employees that have to create new value in order to get compensated is what regenerates the company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Sooner or later, even the fastest-growing company tops out. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The concern I would have for Amazon is that revenue growth has dropped from close to 50 percent annually to less than half that. I think in the short term they are looking at how to accelerate the growth percentages in their core retail business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: justify;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you want to really change the world, Ray Ozzie has concluded, change the conversation. In this case, change it into a medium in which wireless speech becomes a durable, searchable part of the computer world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ozzie, a well-regarded software engineer who in 2010 resigned as Microsoft&#39;s chief software architect, on Tuesday announced a company and product called Talko. An app on the iPhone (and eventually Android phones and desktop computers), Talko enables one-on-one and group calls that can be recorded, tagged, amended and augmented with photos, all while the call is going on.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Later, parts of it can be searched for important elements, such as when a project is due.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I can&#39;t predict how this thing will turn out, but by making voice as easy to use as text it will change things,&#39;&#39; Mr. Ozzie said in an interview. &#39;&#39;If the Internet had been invented first, every voice call would be viewed by a different standard.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That is to say, conversations would be marked and made durable, something that has been long been sought by adherents of something called &#39;&#39;hypervoice.&#39;&#39; Talko does this by some clever software inside the cloud computing systems of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, a global computing system that Mr. Ozzie helped create while at Microsoft.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It does so with an elegant design that allows users to turn down calls or text seeking permissions, or leave one another short voice messages that are more like audio texts than voice mail. During a call, Talko shows images of all participants. The talker takes the center image on the phone&#39;s screen, while others hover above. A running line across the bottom of the screen shows the call is being recorded, and also serves as a marker for insertions to the call like hashtags or photos.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is possible to take a picture during a call and post it so viewers can see the same thing. After the call, Talko creates a log that can show when it took place, who was in it, and what images and subjects were covered. All of this can be searched later, and is at the heart of Talko&#39;s eventual business model.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;In business, having old calls is critical,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Ozzie, who founded Talko with Matt Pope and Eric Patey.

While there has been some concern about the implications of such a move, it seems likely to happen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps it is particularly useful, then, that Mr. Ozzie has baked some privacy protection into Talko: Any participant in the call, he says, has the right to delete all or part of the conversation. &#39;&#39;We wanted to make sure people know it&#39;s in their hands,&#39;&#39; Mr. Ozzie said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Of course, companies may not be bound by Talko&#39;s protections, and could write around these policies; or another provider might come along with a similar service that does not have the delete protection. Early reviews, from a very small test group, were positive, however.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;You don&#39;t need to take notes during conference calls, or worry about things you&#39;ll need to remember to do later,&#39;&#39; said Kelly Fitzsimmons, co-founder of the Hypervoice Consortium, which researches the future of communications and has used Talko. &#39;&#39;It frees people from the work of paying attention to other things in a conversation.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition, she added: &#39;&#39;Ray is providing an answer to the problem of self-reinvention in a world where everything is stored: You can delete yourself.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All Rights Reserved. There are plenty of reasons to see through &#39;&#39;Transparent.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This series, which Amazon began streaming on Friday, is about a transgender woman. And that sounds suspiciously as if Amazon, the competition-crushing online megastore, were trying to top the success of a rival. Netflix was praised for a sensitive portrayal of an incarcerated transgender woman, played by a transgender woman, on &#39;&#39;Orange Is the New Black,&#39;&#39; so now Amazon, of course, wants in. Worst of all, the setting is Los Angeles, in that familiar world of entitled people consumed by real estate, support groups and play dates.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But actually, &#39;&#39;Transparent&#39;&#39; is very good, an insightful, downbeat comedy told without piety or burlesque. The title has another meaning: It&#39;s the story of a transitioning parent. Jeffrey Tambor plays a professor, Mort Pfefferman, a divorced father of three grown children, who decides the time has come to reveal a secret that has been burning inside since he was a small child -- in reality, he is Maura.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And the show&#39;s charm, oddly enough, lies in the main characters&#39; lack of charm. Mr. Tambor is a gifted actor who has been at his best playing strange, self-deluded people in comedies like &#39;&#39;The Larry Sanders Show&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Arrested Development.&#39;&#39; Though some have questioned the casting of a nontransgender performer, he is a bold and inspired choice for the role.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is nothing instantly endearing about Mort or Maura. Mort is bumbling and dreary. Maura has more dignity in a flowing wig and a caftan, but it&#39;s hard to get an exact read on her soul. Maura talks a lot in her support group, flipping the ends of her hair like a teenager, the teenager she didn&#39;t get to be when she was living life as a boy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Visiting a fellow transgender woman, Maura flits through the friend&#39;s apartment, picking up objects, feeling fabrics, inspecting the vanity table, as if trying on this woman&#39;s life for size as they talk. It&#39;s touching, but also, the way Mr. Tambor does it, a little unsettling, an intrusion that under any other circumstances would be seen as nosy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Maura, still dressed as Mort, tries to tell the children and can&#39;t go through with it, we sympathize with her pain without really knowing yet whether she is a sympathetic person.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The children are just as enigmatic. They&#39;re glib, witty, close, yet also detached, insecure and self-absorbed. Josh (Jay Duplass), who is successful in the music business, has a very young girlfriend he is grooming as a performer in an all-girl band, Glitterish. Sarah (Amy Landecker) is the oldest child, a wife and mother who feels estranged from her busy, successful husband and her life as a pampered housewife.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ali (Gaby Hoffmann) is the youngest, smart and sardonic, filling silence with Lena Dunham-like riffs and bad ideas for parody books. She is unemployed and shamelessly mooches off her father and her brisk, energetic mother, Shelly (Judith Light).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When their father summons them to an important family meeting, Ali agrees with Josh that he must have cancer. The first words that comes to Josh&#39;s mind are the tax implications. &#39;&#39;Well if he&#39;s really sick,&#39;&#39; Josh says, &#39;&#39;he should start gifting us 12 thou a year now.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Maura knows her children are selfish, but she nevertheless wants them to understand that their father is not who they thought. The telling doesn&#39;t happen all at once, and the suspense is drawn out in an amusing way, but the</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">most beguiling mystery is Maura herself. She is a woman, but viewers have to keep watching to find out what kind.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeffrey Tambor stars as a transgender woman in Amazon&#39;s new series, &#39;&#39;Transparent.&#39;&#39; (PHOTOGRAPH BY AMAZON)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020140927ea9r0009c</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_012.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark18">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark19">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">DHL to Begin Deliveries by Drone in Germany</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MARK SCOTT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">510 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">25 September 2014 NYT Blogs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

As part of the trial, DHL is expected to send medications twice a day, weather permitting. The deliveries will take place when alternatives, like the local ferry or aircraft services, are not available.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When DHL’s drone, which weighs just under three pounds, lands on the island, one of the company’s couriers will then deliver the packages to local residents, a spokeswoman said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the major stumbling blocks for companies like Amazon and Google has been a lack of regulatory approval for drone flights. Earlier this year, for example, the Federal Aviation Administration banned a proposed aerial delivery service in Minnesota that would have ferried beer from a brewery to nearby ice fishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To avoid similar problems, DHL said that it had worked with the German air traffic agency and the country’s Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure to create a restricted flight zone for the company’s drone project. The aircraft will hover 100 feet off the ground and reach speeds of up to 40 miles per hour during the seven-mile journey from the mainland to Juist.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While the technology for DHL’s drone project, which began last year, has been well tested, a major stumbling block for the trial may be something the logistics company cannot control: the weather. High winds forecast off the German coast for Friday could delay the initial flight.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140925ea9p0015p</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_013.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark20">Business Briefing Business Day</a><a name="bookmark21">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Strikes Against Amazon End Without Wage Talks</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MELISSA EDDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">173 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">25 September 2014 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014.

All Rights Reserved. When Jeff Bezos tells writers to keep quiet, they obey.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every fall, Mr. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, hosts Campfire, a literary weekend in Santa Fe, N.M. Dozens of well-known novelists have attended, but they do not talk about the abundance of high-end clothing and other gifts, the lavish meals or the private planes that ferried some home.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Writers loved it. There was no hard sell of Amazon, or soft sell, either. Mr. Bezos, the man who sells half the books in America, seemed to want nothing more each year than for everyone to have a good time. All he asked in return was silence.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For four years, the bargain held. But the fifth Campfire, which writers say took place over the weekend, is a little different. Amazon’s battle with Hachette, the fourth-largest publisher, is fracturing the secrecy and sapping some of the good will. (Amazon would not confirm that the event was even happening.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The struggle between the retailer and the publisher is ostensibly over the price of e-books but really over profit margins and, ultimately, the future of publishing. The conflict, which is unlike any in recent publishing history, has inflamed tensions across the literary spectrum. It began six months ago and appears unlikely to end any time soon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some repeat Campfire attendees who have supported Hachette in the dispute said that they had not been invited this year. Others said that they were having second thoughts about going. The event has become as divisive as the fight.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘My guess is a lot of writers turned it down this year,’’ said James Patterson, who attended last year’s festivities. Mr. Patterson, whose novels are published by Hachette, gave a speech in May, when he warned that Amazon needed to be stopped ‘‘by law if necessary, immediately.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I wasn’t invited again, and I wouldn’t have gone if I had been,’’ he said. ‘‘I would feel very odd being there.’’ He noted, however, that the event had been ‘‘terrific.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hugh Howey, a self-published science fiction novelist who is one of Amazon’s most dedicated defenders, is in Santa Fe but said he had not wanted to go.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I asked not to be invited back this year, as I want to be able to speak my mind and not have any hint of a quid pro quo,’’ he wrote in an email.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But this kind of openness is not for everyone. Some writers, when contacted about their past attendance and asked whether they were going this year, reacted with something akin to terror. One writer begged not to be mentioned in any way, insisting that it was a private, off-the-record event and should remain so, lest Mr. Bezos be offended.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Amazon mogul does not make attendees sign nondisclosure forms. His team just cautions them that the weekend is off the record. Even those who like to share their every thought on Twitter and Facebook have kept it that way.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ayelet Waldman has attended Campfire with her husband, Michael Chabon. Both novelists signed an open letter this summer in support of Hachette authors, whose books Amazon is making it harder to buy as a way to achieve leverage in the dispute. Ms. Waldman, who gained fame by publicly chronicling some of her most intimate feelings, including loving her husband more than her children, did not respond to emails about Campfire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to discuss Campfire. A spokesman for Mr. Bezos did not respond to a message seeking comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Traces of Campfire on the Internet are decidedly rare. A publishing newsletter mentioned the 2011 event, saying it included Jeff Tweedy of the band Wilco and the directors Jason Reitman and Werner Herzog. Diversified Production Services, which helped stage the 2011 event, describes it on its website as a ‘‘private gathering and conference of influential artists, writers, activists and scientists for a sharing of inspiration and stories.’’ The company listed the ‘‘featured talent’’ that year as the astronaut Neil Armstrong as well as the writer Margaret Atwood, the musicians T Bone Burnett and Moby, and George Martin (presumably the ‘‘Game of Thrones’’ novelist, George R.R. Martin).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A spokeswoman for Ms. Atwood declined to comment except to point out that she was in Europe over the weekend. Mr. Martin could not be reached. Mr. Armstrong died in 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whether or not fear of Amazon is legitimate, it exists.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Authors United, a group of writers, reprinted the open letter denouncing Amazon’s tactics in the Hachette dispute as an advertisement in The New York Times, 17 writers and a trust split the bill. Douglas Preston, the founder of the group, said the writers willing to be identified were Mr. Patterson, David Baldacci, Lee Child, Nelson DeMille, Amanda Foreman, Stephen King, Nora Roberts, Stacy Schiff and Scott Turow. Mr. Preston also paid a share, as did the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seven other contributors asked to remain anonymous. ‘‘They were quite specifically worried about the possibility that Amazon would single them out for punishment,’’ Mr. Preston said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman did not respond to questions on the subject of fear.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Campfire this year was held under the conditions of utmost secrecy, as usual. Mr. Bezos rented the entire Bishop’s Lodge Ranch Resort and Spa, which is set on 450 acres a little north of Santa Fe. If you call the front desk seeking a particular guest, the operator will not ring the room or even take a message. There are guards at the front gate to prevent the curious from getting too far.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos, who built Amazon from its dot-com roots as a bookseller into one of America’s biggest retailers, knows the psychology of writers, several past attendees said in interviews. ‘‘You come to this exclusive event, you are treated fabulously and you get access to the next Steve Jobs, who happens to control how many books you sell,’’ one said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Employees at Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle have to pay for their perks, down to the treats from vending machines. And the company is famously tough on its suppliers; the Hachette conflict is just one example. At Campfire, however, there is no stinting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are impressive dinners, accompanied by live music. There is horseback riding, skeet shooting and lazing by the pool. In the mornings, there are formal talks on highbrow topics. One guest fondly recalled that the swag included down vests, fleeces, shoulder bags and small suitcases to carry all the loot home. Getting back to mundane reality was postponed for the attendees who took one of the private jets. (Others say they took scheduled flights.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Howey said Campfire was nonpartisan. ‘‘They invite all kinds of people with all kinds of stances,’’ he wrote in his email. ‘‘You’re the first person I’ve heard suggest that people turned this down, so I’m inferring from you that the Hachette standoff has created tension?’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The literary world overflows with tension and invective these days. People are choosing sides.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maxine Hong Kingston, who was awarded a National Medal of Arts by President Obama in July, was a Campfire attendee but is not coming back. She signed the open letter.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It seems that I’m not invited,’’ she wrote in an email. She declined to say anything else.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BERLIN — Amazon employees in Germany, frustrated by the company’s refusal to hold wage talks, walked off their jobs Monday in a coordinated strike at four of the company’s distribution centers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A total of 2,000 workers refused to show up for their shifts on Monday in an effort to force the company to accept an agreement in line with other retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The job action was expected to run from the early shift Monday through the late shift on Tuesday, said the Ver.di retail and service workers union, which organized the strike.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon said the number of employees taking part in the strike during the first shift was not significant enough to prevent the company from making its deliveries on time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Less than 600 employees of the early shift have followed the call to strike action,’’ Anette Nachbar, a spokeswoman for Amazon in Germany, said in an email. ‘‘Therefore the strike will not impede on the compliance with Amazon’s delivery promise.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company employs some 9,000 full-time workers in Germany, with thousands more on temporary contracts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the heart of the issue is an attempt by Ver.di to force Amazon to recognize itself as a retailer, which would make it beholden to labor laws that require wages be set through collective bargaining.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon insists that its warehouses are logistics centers, ‘‘not shops frequented by customers.’’ Instead, most of its workers are involved in taking goods from shelves, packing and shipping them, and for their services, they receive wages at the upper end of the pay range for logistics workers, Amazon says.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ver.di has been fighting Amazon since spring 2013, holding successive walkouts at different times, but Monday’s was the first coordinated action to be held simultaneously by workers at the four facilities — at Bad Hersfeld, Leipzig, Graben and Rheinberg.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The workers are demanding their right to a collective bargaining agreement and fair labor conditions,’’ said Stefanie Nutzenberger, a Ver.di member who is responsible for retail.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The union said that Amazon had agreed to increase wages by 2.1 percent to 3 percent in its Graben location, which it attributed to pressure from the strikes. The union said it would keep up the strikes but acknowledged that it was in for a long fight.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the meantime, Amazon has been expanding into neighboring Poland, where two warehouses are opening this month and a third is scheduled to begin operation in October. Two more centers in the Czech Republic are also to be running to serve the German market in time for the Christmas rush.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to its labor woes, Amazon is embroiled in a price dispute with the German division of the Bonnier publishing group over e-book pricing, similar to its conflict with Hachette in the United States. Germans consider books to be of unique cultural value and have laws to prevent retailers from offering discounts on printed copies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last week, the Frankfurt state court ordered Amazon to cease discounting books for disgruntled customers, which violates the publishing industry’s retail price agreements. If it flouts the order, Amazon will face a fine of up to 250,000 euros, or $300,000.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Neither dispute appears to have reduced the appetite of Germans for the convenience of ordering books, clothes and gadgets through Amazon, which saw net sales in Germany grow for the third consecutive year last year, to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$10.5 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140922ea9m003xp</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_017.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark28">BITS</a><a name="bookmark29">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Loosening Limits of Media Sharing, but Only Slightly</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MOLLY WOOD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">748 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">22 September 2014 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 4</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Quietly nestled in Apple&#39;s new iOS 8 mobile operating system is a feature called Family Sharing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It lets you share books, movies, music and apps that you&#39;ve bought at iTunes, iBooks and the App Store with up to six members of your family who are logged in using their own iTunes accounts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So if you bought a song, app or book you really like, and you want to share it with your spouse or child or maybe a sister, you can register their email addresses with Apple and enable limited sharing of digital media.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon announced a similar feature on Wednesday called Family Library, although it applies only to digital books, apps, movies and TV, and audiobooks bought through Amazon or its Prime Instant Video service -- not music. And the sharing is restricted to the accounts of two adults and four children.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In theory, these services sound like a great benefit because if you&#39;re an Apple user you don&#39;t have to let your family log in with your iTunes account.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And, at least with Apple&#39;s service, you can share an MP3 with someone without worrying that you&#39;re somehow infringing copyright by doing so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But this seemingly generous allowance could also be viewed as a limit that&#39;s a result of rigid copyright laws and licensing restrictions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the physical world, you can share a book or DVD or CD that you bought with as many friends and family as you like. You can even sell those items if you want, thanks to the first sale doctrine.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But digital media has been excluded from that doctrine, because, essentially, when you buy a digital song or movie or book, you&#39;re being granted a license to use that media, but you don&#39;t actually own it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a result, there are far more restrictions on what you can do with an MP3 than on what you can do with a CD.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The music, movie, TV and book industries have historically been resistant to anything that resembled the sharing of the digital versions of their goods. One recent example was Amazon&#39;s attempt to let customers lend their digital books to friends for a limited time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The lending process itself is byzantine: The recipient has it for just 14 days, finding the options to loan and return books is difficult, and that&#39;s assuming you can find a title that is actually available to lend out.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Realistically, if you buy a Kindle book and then tell a friend how much you loved it, you&#39;re either telling them to buy it themselves or offering to buy a gift certificate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So, while Family Sharing and Family Library seem like a victory at first, &#39;&#39;to me, this is really a failure of our copyright law,&#39;&#39; said Corynne McSherry, who heads intellectual property policy research at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It presupposes that the content owners should be able to have that kind of control over what they buy,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;Copyright law isn&#39;t changing with our times, because what doesn&#39;t change is that people want to be able to give someone a copy of a book or song that they legally bought.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The fact is,&#39;&#39; Ms. McSherry said, &#39;&#39;that we need Amazon or Apple to have elaborate license agreements in order to make it possible for their customers to be able to do what they should be able to do anyway.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Family Sharing and Family Library features are already far more restrictive than, obviously, handing someone a book or CD.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the short term, it will indeed be nice to be able to share a digital book or song with a partner or family member. But don&#39;t lose sight of the fact that you&#39;re being allowed to do so, with the assumption that the alternative would have made you a pirate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And these new services also let Apple and Amazon track the way you and your family use and consume media -- what you read, watch, listen to and download. It may be personal sharing, but it&#39;s not all that private.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The world of digital media still hasn&#39;t caught up to the simplicity of the physical world; this is a tiny step, but it&#39;s still not quite enough.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With the Alibaba Group to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, many people may have been asking, ‘‘Ali who?’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Professional investors, of course, already know that Alibaba is a fast-growing, hugely profitable Chinese company that is a combination of eBay and Amazon, with a little bit of Google thrown in. They like it so much that they have stampeded to Alibaba’s initial public offering, making it the largest ever on the United States stock market. The deal raised $21.8 billion for Alibaba and gives it an overall market value of $168 billion, two and a half times the size of eBay.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, once the so-called smart money piles into a stock, it’s usually time to start asking dumb questions. And with Alibaba, there are many.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Can the company, which today dominates Chinese e-commerce, fend off competition forever? What about its odd corporate structure? Who, exactly, is checking the company’s books? And why did Alibaba recently spend more than a quarter’s worth of cash flow on what seemed like a grab bag of investments?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In many fundamental ways, investing in Alibaba is nothing like owning a slice of a typical American corporation. It requires far more trust. But as the rush into Alibaba’s public offering shows, mutual funds, hedge funds and pensions are falling over themselves to back the company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘You’ve got a world that is starved for growth, and this segment of the Chinese capital markets offers a high degree of growth,’’ said Brendan Ahern of KraneShares, a mutual fund firm that invests in Chinese companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For many, the allure of Alibaba is in its headline numbers. Alibaba makes most of its revenue from fees and commissions that it receives from the two large Internet marketplaces it operates in China: Taobao is a frenetic and eclectic online bazaar that offers a huge range of goods. Tmall, by contrast, is a more refined platform that established brands use to sell their goods. Together, Alibaba’s marketplaces sold $296 billion worth of goods in the 12 months through the end of June, which is estimated to be more than Amazon and eBay combined.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These kinds of numbers have persuaded some analysts that Alibaba’s shares could trade well above its $68 offering price. James Cordwell of Atlantic Equities, for instance, says that Alibaba is worth about $100 a share, or 30 times the $3.35 a share that he estimates the company will make in profits in 2016. Alibaba, he contends, deserves a multiple of 30 times because that is in line with other Chinese Internet companies — and he expects Alibaba’s earnings to grow at about 30 percent a year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">‘‘Alibaba is highly profitable,’’ he said. ‘‘It is easier to value than Facebook and Twitter at their I.P.O.s.’’ But even bullish analysts like Mr. Cordwell have their concerns.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A big one is whether Alibaba will end up spending a lot of money to stockpile goods and distribute them. Right now, a main attraction of Alibaba is that it does not consume large amounts of cash holding inventory, as is the custom for most retailers, including Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alibaba’s offering also effectively asks investors to give up some basic rights and protections. As is the case with any public company, outside investors have no real way of testing the accuracy of the Alibaba’s financial filings themselves. Investors usually expect outside auditors to assess a company’s books.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">American investors might take some comfort in the fact that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regulates audit firms, to help ensure they are doing their job. But the Chinese government does not allow the board to inspect Chinese audit firms. And the regulator has not inspected Alibaba’s auditor, PricewaterhouseCooper’s affiliate in Hong Kong.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alibaba’s corporate structure is another reason to pause.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The actual entity that is going public, the Alibaba Group, is not based in the United States, but in the Cayman Islands. This entity also does not give investors a true ownership stake in Alibaba’s operating businesses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instead, the Alibaba Group merely has contractual rights to profits from the businesses, an arrangement that allows foreign investors to effectively find a way around Chinese law that would otherwise ban such investment. Adding to concerns over control, Jack Ma, Alibaba’s executive chairman, has majority stakes in the company’s underlying Chinese entities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shareholders might find it hard to rein in Mr. Ma and his associates if they make decisions that outside shareholders disagree with. This fear arose a few years ago when Mr. Ma unexpectedly spun out Alipay, the company’s payments business, causing a rift with Yahoo, which has a big stake in Alibaba.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alibaba has recently made a string of deals that raised eyebrows. In April, the company lent $1 billion to Simon Xie, one of its founders, to finance an investment. Alibaba also took a stake in a Chinese soccer team this year. And after buying a movie production company, Alibaba said that it might have unearthed accounting irregularities, suggesting it did not do good due diligence.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The acquisition numbers are not insignificant: The $1.85 billion that Alibaba spent on acquisitions in the second quarter exceeded the $1.64 billion in cash flows from the company’s operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140919ea9k000bt</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_020.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark34">BITS</a><a name="bookmark35">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Personal Tech; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">With Eye on Rivals, Amazon Refreshes Its Line of Kindles</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MIKE ISAAC; David Streitfeld contributed reporting. 882 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">18 September 2014 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 5</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. It has been said that people don&#39;t want tablets, they want iPads.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For years, Amazon, the online retail giant, has been trying to change that.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company&#39;s latest effort comes in a refresh of its Kindle tablets and e-readers, announced Wednesday evening, with a set of internal hardware improvements and updated software features that Amazon hopes will woo new crowds to its line of devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s strategy: Go after different types of people with many different devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Take the updated Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 tablet. It now includes a powerful 2.5 GHz Snapdragon processor from Qualcomm and comes with the WPS Office app, essentially a way to create and edit documents from the tablet. The app is integrated with Amazon&#39;s Cloud Drive, which will back up documents on Amazon&#39;s servers. Amazon has also built a Fire Keyboard, which connects wirelessly to the HDX 8.9 tablet via Bluetooth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The aim here, it seems, is to go after the segment of the market that wants to use a tablet as a workstation, instead of toting around a laptop. In other words, it&#39;s the same audience that Microsoft has tried to court with its Surface tablet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We have all the power and performance you need to multitask,&#39;&#39; said Jonathan Oakes, a director of product management for Amazon, at a media event on Wednesday. &#39;&#39;Now we&#39;re just making it easier to switch between all the things people want to do.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The HDX will cost $379, which is also about the cost of Microsoft&#39;s Surface RT, depending on which model you buy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But modeling the new Kindle after the Surface is questionable, as the Surface has hardly flown off the shelves. Microsoft took a $900 million write-down on unsold Surface RTs last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For what it&#39;s worth, the HDX also comes with a sound system upgrade, courtesy of Dolby, as well as improved graphics processing and a better display, which could appeal to media-hungry consumers. So it&#39;s not all business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon isn&#39;t just aiming at grown-ups. The Kindle Fire HD Kids Edition, for instance, aims for the opposite end of the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For $149, Amazon offers an updated 6-inch Kindle Fire HD tablet with front-and-rear-facing cameras, an improved display and a better microprocessor. It also comes in an array of pretty colors, much like Apple&#39;s iPods.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The hook, however, is the guarantee that comes with the device. If your child breaks the tablet, Amazon will replace it for up to two years. The shockproof rubber case that comes in the package will probably help protect against that, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The device also allows for full access to &#39;&#39;FreeTime Unlimited,&#39;&#39; Amazon&#39;s child-friendly section of videos, apps and games.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So for about $50 more than the cost of a new Kindle Fire HD, you are essentially buying an extended warranty for a nice child&#39;s toy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, for those who just want to read on their tablet, Amazon has updated its classic line of e-readers. The refresh includes a new $79 Kindle -- the lowest-price option -- as well as a new high-end model, the Voyage, a thin, lightweight reader with an improved front light and touch-screen capability. The Voyage is not cheap; at</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$199, it is Amazon&#39;s most expensive e-reader.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s fall line comes months before the holiday season, when manufacturers like Samsung, Lenovo and Apple will all push their tablets heavily to gift-seekers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But while Amazon has heavily marketed its Fire Tablet products, how successful the company has been in winning over consumers is unclear. Amazon has never broken out its tablet sales numbers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Estimates from analysts, however, show Amazon&#39;s tablet sales dwarfed by its competition. Amazon shipped an estimated 200,000 tablets in the second quarter of 2014, 22nd among tablet manufacturers worldwide, according to IDC, a research firm. For comparison, Apple sold 13.3 million iPads over the same period.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kinley Pearsall, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to provide an exact number for the company&#39;s Kindle sales. However, Ms. Pearsall said that IDC&#39;s estimated numbers were &#39;&#39;way off and way low.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ultimately, the tablets are a means to an end, a portal to Amazon&#39;s major business of selling goods and services and shipping them to customers around the world. In some cases, Amazon is probably making little to no money on each tablet sold, but it counts on making up for that by selling content like digital books and movies to tablet shoppers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Still, to bolster online shopping, Amazon needs to sell more tablets. And that is easier said than done. The new Kindle Fall lineup was available for pre-order on Amazon&#39;s site beginning Wednesday evening.

The notifications from Uber that a driver is coming, or Coca-Cola’s dispatches to its technicians are both run via Twilio. During recent protests on net neutrality, Twilio handled about 50,000 calls to members of Congress.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new capability means that an airline could send a boarding pass to a phone. Other applications could include providing a photograph of a service worker on his way to a job, for higher security; displaying a product or a video of a vacation home to a phone; or sending coupons or loyalty cards to people after they spend a certain amount or enter a mall.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“This is going to create experiences that make using smartphones even more attractive,” said Jeff Lawson, Twilio’s co-founder and chief executive. “We believe photos and videos will be ubiquitous.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That might explain how Twilio was able to persuade United States phone networks to carry its traffic. Twilio may perform its software magic inside Amazon Web Services, but it still has to get permission from big carriers like AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile to carry the traffic to and from consumer devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We’re helping the carriers give their subscribers the services they want,” Mr. Lawson said. “If Uber doesn’t work on your phone by now, it’s bad.” Put another way, the carriers may have to forsake charging a lot for every service, so as to keep customers on their expensive phone contracts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new video and image service works via MMS, which stands for multimedia messaging service. The older text services on Twilio worked on a different short message service, or SMS, system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MMS services are currently available on phone networks, but can take months to procure and deploy, and cost at least $10,000 annually. Twilio charges people $1 a phone number, and then at most a couple of cents a message.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It can, on its debut, potentially work on millions of United States and Canadian phone numbers. What developers may do with the new capability will probably start to be known within a couple of months.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Lawson said Twilio would try to expand the network internationally, much the way its phone and text services are currently used. With 1,200 carriers globally, he acknowledged, this could take awhile.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140918ea9i0028m</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_023.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark40">finance</a><a name="bookmark41">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Hachette’s writers take appeal directly to Amazon board</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,370 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16 September 2014 International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. CORRECTION APPENDED</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is at war with Hachette, and it sometimes seems as if it has always been that way.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a negotiating tool in the battle, which is over the price of e-books, Amazon is discouraging its customers from buying the publisher’s printed books. After six months of being largely cut off from what is by far the largest bookstore in the United States, many Hachette writers are fearful and angry. So this week, they are trying a new tactic to get their work unshackled.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Authors United, a group of Hachette writers and their allies, is appealing directly to Amazon’s board. It is warning the board that the reputation of the retailer, and of the directors themselves, is at risk.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Efforts to impede or block the sale of books have a long and ugly history,’’ reads a letter being posted to the group’s website on Monday morning. ‘‘Do you, personally, want to be associated with this?’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon takes its good name seriously. In the Harris Poll of corporate reputations, it once again took top honors this year. But that prestige is taking a bit of a beating as the fight with Hachette drags on. The disastrous reception for Amazon’s first smartphone, which sold so poorly that the company dropped the price last week to 99 cents, has been another blow.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The letter warns the directors that the discontent might spread.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Since its founding, Amazon has been a highly regarded and progressive brand,’’ it says. ‘‘But if this is how Amazon continues to treat the literary community, how long will the company’s fine reputation last?’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among Amazon’s board members are Patricia Q. Stonesifer, the former head of the Gates Foundation; Jamie S. Gorelick, deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration; John Seely Brown, former director of Xerox’s research center; Thomas O. Ryder, former chief executive of Reader’s Digest; and Judith McGrath, former MTV chairwoman, who officially begins next month. Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, is chairman.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment for this article.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The 1,100 Authors United members, who include Stephen King, John Grisham and Robert A. Caro, have until Wednesday to sign the letter. Then it will be sent to Amazon’s 10 board members.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The letter follows an ad in The New York Times last month that asked readers to email Mr. Bezos and ask him to relent. The ad, like the letter, was the brainchild of Douglas Preston, a thriller writer whose books are published by Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Preston’s sales have dropped substantially since Amazon started squeezing sales of Hachette books in the spring. Anyone contemplating ordering his latest novel, ‘‘The Lost Island,’’ written with Lincoln Child, is warned it might take as long as three weeks to arrive. That, as Amazon and its customers know, might as well be forever.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon wants to pay Hachette less for e-books, saying it will pass the savings on to consumers. Hachette’s position, as it said in a public statement, is that 80 percent of its e-books are already at the price Amazon wants</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">— $9.99 — and that ‘‘Amazon is seeking a lot more profit and even more market share’’ at the expense of authors, other bookstores and publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘If not for our effort, I believe Amazon would have started targeting Simon &amp; Schuster books by now, as they are reportedly involved in similar tough negotiations,’’ Mr. Preston said. ‘‘I can only hope Amazon will think twice before they employ these scorched-earth tactics again.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">People who wrote to Mr. Bezos said they had received no response. Amazon declined to say how many emails it had received.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette and Amazon are still negotiating, and a resolution is not out of the question. But in some ways the parties seem to be digging in for the long haul, as the crucial fall selling season gets underway.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In response to Mr. Preston’s initial efforts, Amazon opened a counterattack, setting up its own group, Readers United.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For what probably amounts to a relatively small amount of money, Hewlett-Packard just made a big bet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thursday afternoon, HP said it had entered an agreement to acquire a company called Eucalyptus, which makes open source software for managing cloud computing systems. The chief executive of Eucalyptus, Marten Mickos, will become general manager of HP&#39;s cloud computing business, reporting directly to Meg Whitman, HP&#39;s chief executive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The price was not disclosed, but it probably was not significant when compared with HP&#39;s $112 billion in annual revenue. The price tag matters less than what the deal says about HP&#39;s intention to build products that in many ways will undermine its existing revenue in several product areas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">HP wants to sell cloud systems to private companies, with options for these clouds to interact with Amazon Web Services, along with other so-called public clouds, a term for cloud systems available from big providers for rent by companies and individuals. HP is also offering its own cloud system, which it can operate on behalf of private companies with more exclusivity than AWS can offer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To make all that work, the HP cloud systems will rely on lots of software besides Eucalyptus, including products that proxy on top of cheap computer servers the kind of data storage and networking that HP also sells. In addition, the tech giant will have to rely less on revenue from selling hardware, and more on software and service contracts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;Success will be a tight alignment of many parts of the company,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Mickos. &#39;&#39;We have to figure out how to work together.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eucalyptus, which came out of an open source project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, had several thousand users of the free software, but far fewer paying customers. The company&#39;s main selling point was that its software was interoperable with AWS.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Putting services and hardware together in new ways is part of &#39;&#39;the hard hill we are in the process of climbing,&#39;&#39; said Martin Fink, HP&#39;s chief technology officer and the head of HP Labs, where much of the development is taking place. &#39;&#39;Is there uncertainty? There is always uncertainty.&#39;&#39; He added that Ms. Whitman has determined that this is where customers are going, so HP needs to adjust its business accordingly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If HP wants to show determination to change with this deal, Mr. Mickos is a particularly telling executive to put in charge of the cloud business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He previously sold MySQL, an open source database company, to Sun Microsystems for $1 billion in 2008. Besides making enough money personally to be able to pick where (and if) he works, Mr. Mickos got an up-close view of a company that couldn&#39;t change with the times. Sun was purchased by Oracle for $7.4 billion in 2009.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He is also on the board of Nokia, which last year was forced to sell its once-mighty phone business to Microsoft.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While MySQL helped make Sun attractive to Oracle (it may be why Sun bought the company), Mr. Mickos says his experience taught him how to judge corporate commitment. &#39;&#39;All big changes must start from the top,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;At the highest level Sun didn&#39;t take the decisions it needed to. I see a board at HP that takes very seriously the change.&#39;&#39; He added, &#39;&#39;they have the patience and determination for something that can take years.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The deal is one of several that signal changing times in the computer business. Last year Dell went private at a cost of $25 billion, in part to retool itself for cloud computing. Last January, IBM sold its low-end server business to Lenovo, since it couldn&#39;t compete profitably enough in the commodity business of servers for data centers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Taiwan&#39;s Quanta, another commodity server maker, now ships pre-configured racks of servers and software to companies like Facebook, at times supplying 80 percent of that company&#39;s servers. In April, HP and Foxconn, another bulk assembly company, announced a joint venture to produce cloud-optimized servers a deal that combined perhaps some loss of autonomy for HP with an impressive pragmatism about the current market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was a big week for smartphones. Apple unveiled two new iPhones — as well as a new smartwatch, which you can think of as a phone for your wrist. Amazon slashed the price of its new phone, and Microsoft, searching for new applications and content for its own struggling mobile platform, sought to acquire the company behind the blockbuster game Minecraft. What can we glean about these three companies — and a fourth, Samsung — from their smartphones?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">A whole lot about their approach to everything. IPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introduced with great fanfare in 2007, the iPhone was one of the few tech products in recent memory that overdelivered on its hype. The iPhone spurred worldwide demand for powerful devices that we carry with us always, everywhere.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The new crop of iPhones suggests that under Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, the company has emerged from the shadow of Steve Jobs, its revered co-founder. Mr. Jobs hated big phones, but the new versions, with screens measuring 4.7 and 5.5 inches diagonally, are gigantic.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple’s new operating system allows users to customize their phones in ways that might have made Mr. Jobs livid. These changes suggest a more open, less aloof Apple — and one bent on making sure that the iPhone remains the most profitable gadget in the tech business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Fire Phone</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon entered the smartphone business just this year, which is a bit like showing up for a New Year’s Eve party after the ball has dropped. The tardiness might have been forgivable if Jeff Bezos, the chief executive, had done what Amazon has always done in new markets: make a very cheap, basic thing, and then compete on price, customer service and ubiquity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But something odd happened with the Fire Phone. Amazon stuffed it to the gills with bells and whistles that few people seemed to want, including a head-tracking system that allowed for a mostly useless 3-D effect.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then there was the price. Amazon sold this novel, unknown phone for $199 with a two-year contract, the same price as that of other high-end rivals. No one was impressed. Analysts say Amazon has sold only a few tens of thousands of the phones; the company seemed to confirm the dismal numbers when it cut the price to 99 cents, with a contract.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Mr. Bezos has a special talent for tweaking his products until they click. So it wouldn’t be wise to count Amazon out of the smartphone game just yet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Samsung Galaxy S5 and Note 4</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Samsung is known in the tech business as a ‘‘fast follower,’’ a derisive term meant to suggest that it can’t come up with its own good ideas. When it comes to smartphones, Samsung responded to the iPhone’s rise by releasing many phones that appeared to closely mimic the hardware and software in Apple’s juggernaut. The plan worked: Samsung quickly became the world’s largest smartphone company, outselling even Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because it sells a lot of those phones for cut-rate prices, Samsung’s smartphone profits still lag behind Apple’s. But Samsung’s business has been buoyed by its relentless experimentation. It will try anything, even ideas that at first seem mindless, because who knows what will work in tech?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2011, Samsung released one such device, a 5.3-inch phone called the Galaxy Note, a phone so big that Gizmodo scoffed that it was ‘‘hardly even designed for humans.’’ Guess what? People loved it, and thus was born the combination phone and tablet, or phablet. Phablets have become a significant portion of the high-end smartphone market, arguably cutting into Apple’s profits. Which explains, in part, Apple’s new big phone. Who’s the fast follower now?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microsoft’s Nokia Lumia 930</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share,’’ Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s former chief executive, declared on the eve of Apple’s smartphone debut in 2007. Then the iPhone hit the market and, ever since, Microsoft has been playing catch-up, revamping its mobile operating system and buying the Finnish phone maker Nokia. Its current chief executive, Satya Nadella, is now charged with saving Microsoft’s business from the crush of phones and tablets running non-Microsoft software.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has done a fine job; its devices are now every bit as good as those of its rivals.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But because the company was so late to full-screen smartphones, Microsoft’s app store is seen by developers as a low priority. The lack of apps on the Windows Phone keeps customers away, which further lowers the phone’s reputation with developers. There’s no easy way to win this battle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140914ea9f0000n</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_028.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark50">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark51">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Google to Give Start-Ups $100,000 in Cloud Computing Credits</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Conor Dougherty 548 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12 September 2014 NYT Blogs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google would like to make more money selling data storage on other services on its Google Cloud Platform, and it’s going after it the old-fashioned Internet way: Give stuff away and make it up on volume.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/" class="a" target="_blank">On Friday, Google is set to announce a new program in which it will offer start-up companies a $100,000 credit on its Google Cloud Platform, according to </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">a post on the company’s Google Cloud Platform blog</span>. The effort is the company’s latest effort to take on Amazon Web Services, the leader in so-called cloud services that encompass a range of back-end computing functions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The post said the offer was available through several dozen “top incubators, accelerators and investors” but it didn’t specify who those top investors might be. It’s also limited to companies that are less than five years old and have less than $500,000 in annual revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To most people, the idea of giving away storage to make money on storage sounds kind of crazy. But it’s not, at least not entirely. Google is taking a gamble that start-ups will go to it looking for savings, and then stay as they get bigger — paying more for services and allowing Google to recoup its investment in them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Much the way growing companies sublease office space instead of building a big headquarters, Google’s Cloud Platform is basically a giant set of computer servers, storage, networking and operational features that app makers need to grow. Google rents these things out, relieving companies of the need to buy and operate many computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Google, which probably runs the world’s largest computing system, the business amounts to leasing out the capacity it doesn’t use. Among other things, Google stores large amounts of data and helps companies run data queries like telling a dating app how many messages its amorous customers send to each other. Start-ups that get Google’s $100,000 in credits could use their credits for any of those services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In some ways, Google is paying for what Amazon acquired free when it was pioneering cloud computing: buzz among growing young companies. A.W.S. was then seen as a cheaper way to get computing and data storage, and it attracted many start-ups, along with stealth engineering projects at larger companies. Some of these early businesses, like Dropbox, have become very large, and their success has helped attract larger companies, like Netflix, to Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google may be trying to get some of the same magic. The company has a history of offering start-ups and web developers access to its products, like Maps, to improve their features and make them more valuable to consumers. By offering the data storage credits, Google may be trying not only for free publicity and to cut off some of Amazon’s new business but also looking for novel ways its cloud can be used.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/activate/" class="a" target="_blank">Though Amazon now handles large corporate computing jobs, including work for Apple, it still has time for start-ups. In October, it introduced A.W.S. as a way </a><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/activate/" class="s1" target="_blank">for small newcomers to use the Amazon cloud.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140912ea9c000um</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_029.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark52">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</a><a name="bookmark53">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble Revenue Is Off, but Loss Narrows</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By ALEXANDRA ALTER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">862 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">10 September 2014 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble reported a smaller first-quarter loss on Tuesday thanks to cost-cutting, but the struggling retailer, the country&#39;s biggest bookseller, could not stave off a 7 percent decline in sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is a challenging moment for Barnes &amp; Noble, the last major national bookstore chain remaining after Borders closed in 2011. Barnes &amp; Noble has struggled to compete in the online retail and e-book market after its Nook e-reader was overwhelmed by more popular devices from Amazon and Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the quarter that ended Aug. 2, the first in its 2015 fiscal year, the company reported revenue of $1.23 billion, down from $1.33 billion in the same period a year ago. It had a net loss of $28.4 million, or 56 cents a share, an improvement over last year&#39;s first quarter, when it posted a net loss of $87 million, or $1.56 a share. The loss was in line with analysts&#39; expectations. Earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization grew to $30 million, in contrast to a loss of $9 million a year ago, owing in part to cost cutting at its Nook division.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the Nook losses continue to mount. Revenue at the Nook segment plummeted 54 percent compared with the previous year. Digital content sales fell 24 percent, to $52 million. In an effort to offset the losses from the Nook, Barnes &amp; Noble is spinning off its Nook Media division into a separate business from its retail stores, a move it aims to complete by the end of March 2015.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The decision to spin off the Nook unit led to a rise in the company&#39;s stock price earlier this year. The company also outsourced the manufacturing of its latest Nook device to Samsung, and released the newest version in late August. The new device sells for $179 and has new features like a camera and Google Play&#39;s store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a conference call with investors and analysts, Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s chief executive, Michael P. Huseby, said the chain was making progress with new school contracts for its college business, which has 705 bookstores at colleges and universities, and with new partnerships and initiatives like its co-branded Samsung device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;This partnership reduces our expenses and provides a platform to grow content sales,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble has been experimenting with ways to expand its retail reach and maintain its footing at a tumultuous moment for the book business, as it faces constant pressure from its biggest competitor, Amazon. In August, Barnes &amp; Noble teamed up with Google to test the market for same-day delivery of books and other products from its brick-and-mortar stores in Los Angeles, New York and the San Francisco Bay Area, taking direct aim at Amazon&#39;s delivery service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has even ventured recently into print-on-demand services to give its customers instant access to obscure titles, and it is testing Espresso Book machines in three outlets in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The machines allow users to self-publish books or print out a title in minutes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s unclear whether such efforts will secure the bookseller&#39;s future. Barnes &amp; Noble has been shuttering stores around the country, including three more in the most recent quarter. Revenue at its retail arm, which has a base of 658 stores and BN.com, was down 5 percent because of store closings and tepid online sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mitchell S. Klipper, the chief executive of the company&#39;s retail group, said that the declines at the stores were smaller than expected, and that foot traffic was bolstered in part by demand for movie-tie in editions of books like Veronica Roth&#39;s &#39;&#39;Divergent&#39;&#39; and Disney&#39;s &#39;&#39;Frozen.&#39;&#39; Sales were also lifted by the continuing dispute between</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon and Hachette, which has resulted in shipping delays from Amazon on some Hachette titles, Mr. Klipper said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company is also expecting strong holiday sales for new books from Ken Follett, John Grisham and Bill O&#39;Reilly, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While some analysts seemed encouraged by the company&#39;s efforts to cut losses, others said the continued drop in revenue was a bad sign.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;If your store sales are perpetually declining, even if it&#39;s by a small percentage every year, that doesn&#39;t bode well for the future,&#39;&#39; said James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. &#39;&#39;Unless you see a turnaround for Barnes &amp; Noble, it&#39;s hard to imagine how this is anything other than a gradual, slow decline.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Publishers have been anxiously monitoring the bookseller&#39;s health, and many in the publishing industry worry about dwindling shelf space and decreasing visibility for their books. After years of declining print sales, the publishing industry has shown signs of health this year, bolstered in part by the meteoric growth of the young adult market. Total revenue in trade sales grew 6.5 percent in the first quarter of 2014, compared with the previous year, according to the latest figures available from the Association of American Publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020140910ea9a00038</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_030.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark54">B</a><a name="bookmark55">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">AMAZON CUTS STRUGGLING PHONE&#39;S PRICE TO 99 CENTS</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">65 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9 September 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2007, Alan Martin was attending Webster University, pursuing a master’s degree in procurement and acquisitions at a campus in Utah, when he realized he was able to sell his used textbooks for about the same price he had paid for them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From this observation came Mr. Martin’s start-up CampusBookRentals. It was based in Syracuse, Utah, and it grew quickly, reaching No. 17 on Inc. magazine’s list of the fastest-growing private companies, with $21 million in revenue in 2011. People took notice, including some of the people supplying Mr. Martin with textbooks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Martin’s biggest source of textbooks was Amazon — until it decided to stop supplying him in 2010, which forced Mr. Martin to change course. He continued to rent out textbooks, but he renamed his company Sidewalk and redirected its energy and money into developing software for campus bookstores. The company’s fast growth slowed, but Sidewalk says it made a $2.8 million profit on $40 million in revenue last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a conversation that has been condensed and edited, Mr. Martin, 35, talked about how he had survived the fight with Amazon, why he is still at war with much of the publishing industry and why a company created to disrupt the industry now thinks that campus bookstores are the place to be.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. How did you finance the original business?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Before the financial collapse, credit cards were still readily available. Me and three friends started to collect credit card offers and submit them. We raised a little over $250,000.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. How long did it take you to pay off that debt?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. We technically didn’t pay that off until 2011. All the offers came in the spring of 2008, and most were interest-free for a year and then 10 percent. So we weren’t getting destroyed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. Where did you get the books to rent out?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Early on, we were buying books from students on Half.com and Amazon and basically any open marketplace. We built the entire thing on a just-in-time model.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We knew every book that we could acquire and the price, but we didn’t place the order until a consumer ordered it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. So Amazon and Half.com delivered the books in their own packaging?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Yes. For two to three years, only 30 percent shipped from our own warehouse. To mitigate confusion, we sent a bright pink return mailer to every customer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. Did you have problems being so dependent on third-party suppliers?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. We certainly did. We were competing for the same customer. Some marketplaces turned us off, canceled thousands upon thousands of orders in a really bad way.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. Who cut you off?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. It was really just Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Q. So you had promised books to students starting courses and suddenly you had no books. What did you tell the students?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A. We were totally honest but we never exposed Amazon because they just made a decision that made sense for them. We said we made a really big mistake and we’re sorry, and we offered a very nice coupon to come back to the site. Like 40 percent off.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. What did you do to make sure it wouldn’t happen again?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. We put real contractual relationships in place with a lot of marketplaces. And we diversified. We had every book in six or seven places.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. But Amazon is still one of your suppliers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Everything is a lot more contractual now.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. How do you figure out rental prices?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A. It’s just a big math formula that says, how long do we think the book will be alive and at what point do we think we want to sell it. And then all we do is say, how much is it going to cost and how many times do we have to rent it to hit our margin over that time? A book lives on average three years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. What margin do you look for?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. We’re about a 40 percent gross margin business. That gives us space to consume our costs and be profitable, which we’ve been since 2009.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. Why did you start working with campus bookstores?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. We saw that bookstores were a phenomenal distribution channel. They were convenient. They had accurate product. The only reason they were losing market share was that they were overpriced. We thought we could drive more value if we tuned the existing machine. When we made the transition from CampusBookRentals to Sidewalk, it was largely because we thought local was good. You can’t walk off the street to Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What do you do for the campus stores?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. First, we offered them rental. We brought in touch-screen kiosks. Students could pick up a book, check out and then walk away with a rented book in hand.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. Who owns the book?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. The store, initially. The moment the book rents, we own it. We buy it from the store at retail price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. What happens to the books when the student is done?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. After the rental, the student just brings it back to the bookstore and never knows that we’re involved. The bookstore makes the decision to keep it and put it back in inventory or send it back to our warehouse.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. What if the bookstores end up with used books they don’t need?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Wholesalers have never allowed the parties to talk to each other because it would remove the wholesaler from the equation. So we launched a product called Marketplace that allows bookstores to trade inventory among themselves instead of having to buy from wholesalers or publishers. Marketplace was launched at the end of 2013. In the first six months, over 230 stores signed up and we did $1.5 million in trade.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. I assume you get a commission?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. We get a 9 percent commission. On average, stores using Marketplace are saving 35 percent over what they would normally pay, and that translates right to the student.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. Are paper textbooks going away?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Digital did come to trade, but in textbooks there’s been very little movement. We are deploying technology into as many campuses as we possibly can on the back of physical books. When the time comes, we will flip the relationship from physical to digital distributorship.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. Could your technology work in other industries?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. We do see this jumping the walls outside campus retail. Our technology ties the stores together — imagine a bike shop in Utah and one in Northern California. These people aren’t competing with each other; they’re all competing with Amazon or REI or whoever. So why not leverage their strength?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140904ea950002x</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_032.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark58">DealBook</a><a name="bookmark59">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business Day; Dealbook</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Mattress Firm Holding to Buy Rival Sleep Train</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID GELLES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">346 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 September 2014 NYT Blogs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

The company, which is private, had revenue of $471 million last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This will add to Mattress Firm’s holdings, which include more than 1,500 stores across 36 states. At the combined company, pro forma revenue is expected to approach $2 billion a year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The acquisition of Sleep Train will establish Mattress Firm as the first border to border, coast to coast multibrand mattress specialty retailer in the United States,” R. Stephen Stagner, Mattress Firm’s chief executive, said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sleep Train’s chief executive, Dale Carlsen, and chief financial officer, Rob Killgore, will continue in new roles at the combined company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Since 1985, Sleep Train has provided our customers with a good night’s sleep and been a strong partner in our communities,” Mr. Carlsen said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2010, Sleep Train introduced an employee stock ownership plan, allowing the company’s workers to obtain equity in the company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post has announced that its publisher, Katharine Weymouth, is stepping down, signaling the end of the Graham family’s connection to the newspaper it owned for 80 years before selling it last year to Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Weymouth will be succeeded by Frederick J. Ryan Jr., the founding chief executive of Politico and a former Reagan administration official. According to Tuesday’s announcement, he will start Oct. 1.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Weymouth, a granddaughter of Katharine Graham, the longtime Washington Post publisher, was the last major link to the family that had taken on a sitting president during the Watergate scandal and transformed the paper into an American institution. Her uncle, Donald E. Graham, was the chairman of The Post before selling to Mr. Bezos, and it was expected that Mr. Bezos would bring in his own publisher to oversee the paper’s business operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since Mr. Bezos paid $250 million for The Post last summer, many had thought he might apply the kind of disruptive and innovative business strategies to the struggling newspaper business that he has demonstrated at Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under his ownership, the paper has hired dozens of journalists and focused more intently on The Post’s digital enterprise. But Mr. Ryan’s appointment is the first prominent leadership change.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ryan, 59, helped start Politico in 2007 along with several Washington Post journalists who created a website focused on politics. He also served as chief operating officer of Politico’s parent company, Allbritton Communications.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reaction to his appointment was mixed in Washington, and in media circles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘He is a very savvy guy, a very competent guy,’’ said Bill Lord, who worked closely with Mr. Ryan as the general manager at WJLA-TV, which was owned until recently by Allbritton. ‘‘He may be running the business end of things, but he is very friendly to journalists.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ryan used his connections with the Reagan family to help secure Politico’s involvement in presidential primary debates, an important milestone for the new site, said one former Politico staff member. But others who worked closely with him expressed surprise that Mr. Bezos, renowned as an innovative thinker, would appoint a publisher described by many as the quintessential, conventional Washington insider.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At Politico, Mr. Ryan obsessed over the details of the annual White House Correspondents Dinner, a celebrity-driven black-tie event attended by the media and politicians, said one former colleague.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And he was generally more involved in Allbritton’s TV business than he was with Politico, current and former staff members said. Mr. Ryan stepped down from his roles at Politico and Allbritton last year, shortly after Allbritton sold its TV stations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan said that he had in fact been very closely involved with Politico and had learned much about both traditional print media and digital operations that he hoped to apply at The Post. And he said he viewed the White House Correspondents Dinner as ‘‘an important event.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ryan said that he and Mr. Bezos believe that ‘‘shrinking is not going to be the way to success in this very competitive media landscape.’’ The two plan for The Post to continue growing, he said, and will also focus on technology and on ‘‘the reader, and future reader, user and future user’’ and ‘‘how, where, and how often they engage.’’ He hopes to work closely with Mr. Bezos, though ‘‘obviously he does have a day job,’’ he said, referring to Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ryan said that he had been appointed after meeting Mr. Bezos through mutual friends. The two had ‘‘a number of conversations about the exciting possibilities in the media, the opportunities for the future,’’ he said, which culminated in his being offered the position.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Weymouth, 48, said that she was leaving the paper with mixed emotions. The decision to step aside now was not Ms. Weymouth’s, though she was not dismissed for poor performance, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In a statement, Mr. Bezos said that Ms. Weymouth ‘‘has successfully led many new initiatives and assured that the first ownership change of this great institution in 80 years has been done smoothly and without skipping a beat.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos and Ms. Weymouth declined requests for interviews.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The move is the end of an era in Washington. The Graham family, which bought The Post in 1933, was known for its unbending support for the paper’s journalism and for being the center of a social scene, including the political, media, diplomatic and business elite, that spanned both Washington and New York.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In her note to staff members, Ms. Weymouth wrote that it was ‘‘time for new leadership. With Jeff Bezos as our new owner, you are already seeing an infusion of energy and ideas. This is just the beginning of a wonderful new chapter for The Post.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to a securities filing from the Graham Holdings Company, the name the Graham family company took after selling The Post, Ms. Weymouth had been paid about $2.7 million in bonuses related to the performance and the sale of the newspaper in the last year or so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some current and former Washington Post employees lamented the end of the Grahams’ connection to the paper.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘And now, for my own part, I can say that it took me a long time to comprehend that the Graham era at The Post is finally and fully over,’’ David Maraniss, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter, wrote in an essay at The Columbia Journalism Review on Tuesday. ‘‘The Post under the Grahams was maternal and paternal and uneven and beautifully flawed. But most of all, it was deeply human.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140903ea940003e</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_034.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark62">B</a><a name="bookmark63">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">AMAZON&#39;S BET ON CONTENT, IN A HUB FOR GAMERS</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID CARR</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">60 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 September 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Wednesday night, I spent time on Twitch.tv watching people watch people play StarCraft II, Call of Duty and League of Legends.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you cover media, you get used to meta activities, but staring at my computer watching an audience watch others play streaming video games was a new level of remove. There were funny, eccentric grown-ups, but also a lot of teenage boys talking profane smack on headsets, often with corrosive rap spinning in the background, as they maneuvered through seemingly impenetrable game environments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After surfing around for 90 minutes, I couldn&#39;t help asking, is this really a thing?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Actually, Amazon believes it&#39;s a $1.1 billion thing. Last Monday, the company announced it would buy Twitch, which surprised most industry observers because they thought Google had wrapped up a purchase. It surprised me because I had no idea what Twitch was.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">My demographic hem is showing. I&#39;ve always taken pride and interest in staying with the wave, swimming in a sea of devices, apps and new business models. But even as video games threaten to become bigger than Hollywood in terms of gross revenue, I&#39;ve never caught the bug. Maybe if I had had sons instead of daughters, or taken more of an interest in Madden NFL rather than the actual N.F.L., I&#39;d be in the know. I&#39;m not, but I knew what I needed to do. I called Clark.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clark is the 17-year-old son of friends of mine at our summer place. I have spent many hours there chatting with him about his custom-built gaming PC, which, he tells me, includes dual Asus GTX graphics processing units, 16 gigabytes of Crucial Ballistix Sport memory and extra cooling units to keep the beast from overheating while he is busy killing targets. He likes Twitch, of course.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a community, or really a bunch of communities within communities, organized around certain games,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So ... all these people gather online to listen to people discuss the games they are playing as they play them? &#39;&#39;They don&#39;t just talk about the games, they talk about themselves, too,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;You learn stuff and you can see their faces, so you can see emotions and what makes them laugh.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It isn&#39;t like TV,&#39;&#39; he added. &#39;&#39;In gaming, you are the character, you&#39;re the one that that&#39;s deciding.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Twitch has built a platform that hosts live events akin to the N.F.L., the United States Open or the X Games -- and it has the audience to show for it. Part of the magic is that on Twitch, you are not just watching other gamers, but hyper-talented digital warriors, the Peyton Mannings and Roger Federers of Counter-Strike and Minecraft.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From a standing start in 2011, Twitch garnered 55 million unique users in July who watched 155 billion minutes of gaming and has become the country&#39;s fourth-largest user of Internet bandwidth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even the gamers on Twitch were surprised how much it was worth. I was watching someone named Sing_sing play Dota 2 -- don&#39;t ask, I couldn&#39;t tell you -- and he murmured to the people watching, &#39;&#39;$970 million, I don&#39;t even understand how that works,&#39;&#39; referring to the cash portion of the purchase price. As he tried to destroy something called the Ancient, he added, &#39;&#39;I guess it&#39;s because the numbers keep growing and growing.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They certainly do. According to The Wall Street Journal, last October, more people -- 32 million -- watched a championship for League of Legends, on various streaming services including Twitch, than saw the finales of &#39;&#39;The Sopranos,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;24&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Breaking Bad,&#39;&#39; combined.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s desire to outmaneuver both Google and Yahoo and get its hands on the controller at Twitch probably makes sense. Demographically, it&#39;s a bit of a leap -- Amazon&#39;s user base looks more like me than the young people on Twitch, but then, that&#39;s sort of the point. You have to build your next cohort of customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And after years of contenting itself as the biggest online retailer of hard goods, Amazon has made its media ambitions clear -- part of its future lies in occupying screens of all sorts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But finding a place in the media hierarchy among the traditional players and digital insurgents like Netflix that have a head start is a long, expensive grind. Just last week, Amazon unveiled a slate of five traditional television pilots with big names attached. But so far, the original programming, created for its Prime subscription service, hasn&#39;t caught fire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The economics of Twitch are compelling partly because it supplies its own content and audience, comparable to an oven that produces its own food. But it wouldn&#39;t be streaming all that content to giant audiences if it didn&#39;t get the technology right. People who marvel at the growth of Netflix would do well to remember that it cracked the code on the technology side of streaming before it ever competed for Emmys. Netflix caught on because the service worked.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, Twitch won in a space where others failed because it got the infrastructure right. Gaming is a bandwidth hog, and Twitch is able to host multiplayer games, large events and commentary because the company invested in at least 15 data centers jammed with servers. If that sounds familiar, keep in mind that Amazon became the dominant online retailer on Earth by using technological might to remove friction and frustration from the buying experience. No one has its hands on more cloud capacity than Amazon, so bolting Twitch into Amazon on the tech side -- it will remain independently run -- will allow it to scale without interruption.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has made its own investments in gaming, but the costly Twitch acquisition -- the second-biggest in its history after the $1.2 billion it paid for Zappos in 2009 -- positions the company in a complicated media future where traditional television series will compete for mindshare with game lords, shopping and makeup stars on YouTube as well as celebrities&#39; Instagram feeds.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is a huge land grab for nontraditional models of programming. DreamWorks Animation bought AwesomenessTV, a popular YouTube channel, last year, and in March, Disney snatched up Maker Studios, a video supplier for YouTube, while Peter Chernin, formerly president of News Corporation, has invested in Crunchyroll, a streaming hub of anime. All of these deals are about content, but they are also a hedge, a way of exploring other production protocols that don&#39;t involve prominent stars, agents and expensive producers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Michael Frazzini, vice president for Amazon Games, framed the Twitch purchase in vivid, simple terms in an interview with Time magazine.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I think it&#39;s fairly safe to say at this point that on anything with a screen, games are the No. 1 or 2 activity,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon sells those screens -- the Kindle, Fire TV and Fire Phone -- and buying Twitch, along with deals with HBO, Nickelodeon and other providers, means that it has the software assets -- in this case, entertainment -- to animate sales of those devices. You need look only at the role of iTunes in the development of iPods and then the iPhone to understand how a ready universe of desirable content can move units.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Say what you want about game nerds, there is clear value in owning so much screen time of a hard-to-reach demographic of young men. Even if I don&#39;t get gaming, I am beginning to understand the larger game it represents.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Email: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter: @carr2n</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A player streaming a World of Warcraft mission on the website Twitch.tv.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To call Twitch.tv a happy accident would be a grand understatement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The website has quickly emerged as the go-to destination for watching video games, drawing tens of millions of viewers each month. On Monday, that success led to a huge payday for the company’s founders, as Amazon said it had reached a deal to buy Twitch for more than $1 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Twitch was never supposed to exist.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The site grew from a small side project started by a handful of start-up engineers into a company that — as one of the founders described in an interview last week — happened to land at the right place at the right time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It became the tail that wagged the dog,’’ Emmett Shear, one of Twitch’s founders, said in the interview. ‘‘It ended up taking over our whole company.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2006, Mr. Shear and Justin Kan had a question: What would happen if they wore cameras 24 hours a day and broadcast their lives to the web?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That curiosity led them to create Justin.tv, and Mr. Kan became the star, ‘‘lifecasting’’ his daily activities for anyone to see. Regular users were invited to do the same.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Mr. Kan and Mr. Shear quickly noticed that most of Justin.tv’s success came from video game players who used the site to stream themselves playing. In 2011, the group decided to create a separate company, introducing Twitch — a new, entirely gaming-focused version of the site — at the E3 gaming exposition in California.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It became clear that it was its own beast,’’ Mr. Shear said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company said on Tuesday that Mr. Shear was not available to discuss the company’s plans, now that it will be owned by Amazon. But one thing is clear: Twitch is a huge business, a hot spot for people to watch and chat about what has essentially become online gaming as spectator sport, one played not with shoulder pads and helmets, but with ergonomic keyboards and screen-mounted webcams.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The site has many similarities to YouTube, the reigning king of online video. As on YouTube, people host their own individual video channels. Anyone can start a channel, and most anyone can watch others’ channels.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But unlike YouTube, Twitch’s focus is on games and especially on live-streaming video, not recorded video. People with a channel on Twitch host live video sessions of the games they are playing — whether short, first-person shoot-’em-up battles or lengthy group quests in role-playing games like World of Warcraft.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Broadcasters often converse with their followers in a dedicated chat room. Popular streamers can amass thousands of followers; the most popular streamers have fans that number in the millions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In part, Mr. Shear said, Twitch’s surge in popularity is the result of technological changes beyond the company’s control. Live-streamed video is only as good as the Internet network it runs on. And until recent years, the broadband backbone in the United States struggled to handle the heavy traffic that live streaming demands.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This couldn’t have existed five years before we launched it,’’ Mr. Shear said. ‘‘You needed high-resolution video. You needed broadband Internet, which just wasn’t there.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">South Korea, by comparison, has had more robust Internet networks than the United States for years. When the service was becoming popular with gamers, United States broadband speeds were a fraction of those in South Korea, according to a 2010 report from Akamai, an Internet content delivery network. High-speed access was also more expensive in the United States than in South Korea, according to Akamai.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is perhaps no surprise, then, that South Korea has been the leader in live-streamed gaming, hosting major tournaments in which gamers compete against one another in front of millions of online viewers for big prizes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But now in the United States and elsewhere, Mr. Shear said, ‘‘Internet access is just getting cheaper and cheaper, faster and faster.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The speed has helped Twitch generate 55 million regular visitors from around the world each month, and those people watch 16 billion minutes of its videos. More than 1.1 million people broadcast their gaming activity to the service. (In the meantime, Justin.tv operations were wound down completely this month.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Along with the advancement of technology, Twitch largely credits its success to its robust network of engaged members. In essence, the company has turned into a cluster of ad hoc social networks, a place to chat about anything from the game on the screen to what people had for breakfast that morning.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Every channel is its own microcommunity, where everyone gets to know each other over their shared interests,’’ Mr. Shear said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tessa Brook, a 30-year-old woman who goes by the name Tessachka on Twitch, posts her regular online gaming schedule — about 42 hours a week — so her 5,000 followers know when they can watch her play.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I think Twitch was born out of a simple need to share game experiences,’’ said Brian Blau, a technology analyst at Gartner Research. Twitch is not a traditional social media company, like Facebook, he said, but the site’s social aspect is at its core. ‘‘Twitch connects gamers together with social-like features, and that creates a community.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For Ms. Brook and popular streamers like her, gaming can also be lucrative. Popular players who are selected for Twitch’s partner program earn a cut of the revenue from advertisements that run on their channel.

And again, over all, the comedies are better. Perhaps the prestige associated with outlets like HBO, AMC and Netflix still draws better dramatic projects. Here’s a rundown of the latest Amazon pilots, from best to worst.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RED OAKS Set at a suburban New Jersey country club in 1985, Mr. Green’s pilot is not a sendup of 1980s coming-of-age comedies or even a tribute to them, but a surprisingly straightforward extension of the genre. It’s as if the spirits of John Hughes, Harold Ramis and the young Richard Linklater had all gotten together to consult. Craig Roberts stars as David, a college student spending his summer as the assistant tennis pro under the tutelage of the club’s paunchy stud, Nash (a funny Ennis Emmer). Providing some ’80s flavor are Jennifer Grey, as David’s mom; Paul Reiser, as the club’s alpha male; and an abundance of female toplessness.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE COSMOPOLITANS Mr. Stillman’s first television-length project stars Adam Brody (“The O.C.”) and the newcomer Jordan Rountree as Americans living in Paris whose only discernible occupations are falling in love and crashing high-class parties. It’s Henry James with the nutritional value of a Ladurée macaron: Evanescent or perhaps just wispy, it seems to melt out of your mind as you’re watching it, and it’s hard to imagine that it could be turned into a series. But it’s quite amusing, especially at the beginning, and not as arch as you might expect.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HAND OF GOD Ranking this as the better of the two dramas is a coin flip. Mr. Forster (“World War Z,” “Quantum of Solace”), also going short-form for the first time, directed from a script by Ben Watkins (“Burn Notice”) that’s almost comically overheated. Ron Perlman plays a corrupt judge who goes off the deep end after his son attempts suicide. He starts to believe that God is leading him to the people who drove his son to desperation, and, of course, he may be right. There are also an unsolved rape and a shady construction project involved in this Southern California noir, which recalls the novels of Ross Macdonald but primarily plays like an attempt to pack every cliché of the grim, cable crime drama into one hour.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HYSTERIA The veteran television producer Shaun Cassidy (“Invasion”) is behind this drama that combines the contagion thriller with the Internet paranoia thriller. When girls in Austin, Tex., have unexplained seizures that then spread to the general population, a neurologist (Mena Suvari) working on the case begins to suspect that the affliction is being spread through social media. Yes, that viral video could actually be viral. With references to witch hunts (the opening titles include images of Joseph McCarthy) and earnest dialogue like “What if, because of the way we communicate now, you don’t need to know someone to feel their pain?,” it’s too contrived and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">on-the-nose to be particularly scary or entertaining.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29LaBute-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" class="a" target="_blank">REALLY Written and directed by and (unfortunately) starring Jay Chandrasekhar, this noncomedy feels like a laboratory experiment: Just how off-putting can a show be and still maintain the semblance of entertainment?

The project was detailed in a </a><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/inside-googles-secret-drone-delivery-program/379306/" class="s1" target="_blank">lengthy Atlantic story.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011" class="a" target="_blank">If the idea sounds familiar, that’s because online retailer Amazon announced an experimental program last year that </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">would also deliver goods through the air</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/" class="a" target="_blank">The program, which Google is calling “Project Wing,” was led for two years by </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Nicholas Roy</span>, an M.I.T. professor who took a sabbatical for the project.

They also tried landing it, but that was problematic because Google believed people might get too close to the vehicle and lose a finger to the drone’s rotors while trying to fetch their delivery.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRTNvWcx9Oo&amp;feature=youtu.be" class="a" target="_blank">In the end, they settled on a kind of fishing line that lowers the payload to customers from an airborne drone about 150 feet above the ground, as Google demonstrates with a package of dog food in </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">this video</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140829ea8s0002t</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_040.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark74">CRITIC&#39;S NOTEBOOK</a><a name="bookmark75">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Unveils Its Latest Smiles and Thrills</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MIKE HALE</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">747 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">28 August 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved. The video in video games is suddenly a billion-dollar business.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Video games have long been something people played. But in the last few years, thanks in part to fast Internet access and multiplayer games, the games have become something that people sit back and watch, too. On Monday, that new habit enticed the web giant Amazon to reach a $1.1 billion deal to buy Twitch, the most popular website for watching people play games.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The deal for Twitch is the latest sign of the way forms of behavior once seemingly on the fringe can, in the hands of tech entrepreneurs, turn into huge online communities in no time. Twitch did not exist a little over three years ago, and it now has 55 million unique viewers a month globally, helping turn games into a spectator event as much as a participatory activity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those millions of eyeballs are valuable to web companies, and Amazon, although usually known for its retailing, is no exception. To win in its bid for Twitch, Amazon had to outmaneuver a who’s who of the technology world, including Google — strongly suggesting that these companies think the era of video-game viewing is just starting. It also underscored Amazon’s growing appetite for controlling and delivering content to digital devices, especially the tablets and smartphones made by Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Broadcasting and watching gameplay is a global phenomenon,’’ Jeffrey R. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, said in a statement, ‘‘and Twitch has built a platform that brings together tens of millions of people who watch billions of minutes of games each month.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Twitch specializes in live videos of people playing games, including regular Joes blasting away in Call of Duty, a popular shooting game, and elite players who earn million-dollar payouts at professional game tournaments.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Twitch viewers typically see the screen of a broadcaster, featuring the game being played, along with a video feed of the player’s face and a chat window so they can communicate with the player and others watching the action.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The site has attracted enough viewers to put it among 15 most-trafficked websites around the world, according to data compiled by Sandvine, an Internet networking company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Twitch viewers flock to the site to improve their gaming skills by watching people who have mastered a game or just to get a closer look at games before buying them. Some of the biggest followings on Twitch are of people who are simply amusing, rather than the best players.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gamers can transmit games over Twitch by using PCs along with consoles like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Twitch says that people watch more than 16 billion minutes of its videos each month. More than 1.1 million unique broadcasters use Twitch to stream video.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company shares advertising revenue with people who broadcast over its service. While the audiences for many broadcasters are so small that they make little money, some broadcasters are said to earn over six figures a year.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The service has dovetailed with the rise of e-sports, as professional gaming is often called. Twitch broadcasts the action from live tournaments for big games like League of Legends and Dota 2. Professional gamers also use Twitch to let spectators watch their practices, inviting them to ask questions about playing techniques.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘Before Twitch, gaming was something you did in the basement in the glow of your monitor,’’ said David Cowan, a venture capitalist with Bessemer Venture Partners, a big investor in Twitch. ‘‘Now it’s something you can do in groups with hundreds and thousands of people.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is not clear exactly how Amazon intends to fit Twitch into its eclectic and ever-expanding portfolio of businesses. It could help accelerate the company’s advertising ambitions by giving it a huge video network to pump commercials through. This year, Amazon ad revenue is expected to jump 40 percent, to over $1 billion, according to estimates from eMarketer, a technology research firm.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon plans to let Twitch operate independently, out of its offices in San Francisco, according to Emmett Shear, Twitch’s chief executive. The deal includes stock Amazon is paying to retain Twitch employees and $970 million in cash, said a person briefed on the terms of the deal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For months, Amazon has been in a nasty public feud with the Hachette Book Group over the pricing of that publisher’s e-books, showing just how important unfettered access to digital content is to the company’s ambitions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has started to invest heavily in developing original television shows and movies, and even to develop games of its own, all of them accessible to a growing array of devices, including an Amazon smartphone, television set-top box and tablets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘We’re heavily invested in games already,’’ Mike Frazzini, vice president for Amazon games, said in an interview. ‘‘We have a healthy business selling games to customers.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said the Hachette dispute had shown that Amazon needed to invest more in content that it can control. ‘‘It puts them into a vulnerable position where they need to make sure they have hours and hours of stuff to pump into these devices,’’ Mr. McQuivey said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon could also face pricing disputes with game publishers, since Twitch has agreements with major game makers that allow it to broadcast content from their games.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some publishers, though, are interested in more lucrative deals with Twitch than the ones they have now. One such publisher, Activision Blizzard, which owns the games Hearthstone and Call of Duty, is unlikely to continue its current business arrangement with Twitch, according to a person briefed on the company’s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Twitch ‘‘loves Blizzard’s games,’’ Mr. Shear said, and the company wants to help Blizzard make more money from the site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘It’s a huge marketing value for them,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Shear said that the site also provided a community meeting place — recalling an old ritual, when gamers would crowd one another in arcades.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘What Twitch supports isn’t even new — it’s old,’’ he said. ‘‘But what’s new, that showed up in the past few years, is the entire online community can participate en masse in this kind of full interactive experience.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document INHT000020140826ea8r0003u</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_043.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark80">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark81">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Daily Report: How Twitch.tv Became a Nexus for Video Gamers</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">166 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">27 August 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

It is trying to make sure that its consumer-centric service stays easier to use than what the big guys provide.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It’s very tough just to be in the storage business,’’ said Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive of Hightail. ‘‘We don’t think that is what we’re selling anymore.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the technology industry, they call this sort of reinvention of the core business model a ‘‘pivot.’’ Another way to describe it is a fight for survival.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Box, founded in 2005, has attracted $512 million in investment, and in March it filed papers for an initial public offering of stock. In July, the company said it had 39,000 businesses signed up, paying from $15 to $35 a month per user. It is hard to know how many people that is, since some of the businesses have just a couple of people, and others include General Electric and Eli Lilly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dropbox has 300 million customers worldwide and actually runs inside Amazon Web Services, as do parts of Box. Many Dropbox customers pay nothing and get two gigabytes of storage capacity a month, the equivalent of 1,000 books or seven minutes of high-definition television. A version for $10 a month offers 100 gigabytes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hightail, which used to be called YouSendIt, says it has over a half-million business customers paying $25 a month or more, depending on the features chosen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘There’s a place for all of them,’’ said Amita Potnis, an analyst at IDC. ‘‘Amazon’s focus is really computing itself. The smaller ones have to focus on ways businesses actually use it.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For example, she said, the services can help companies collaborate with each other online instead of sending emails back and forth with attachments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While devices and apps get most of the attention, data storage is every bit as important, particularly as objects like phones, tablets, cars and thermostats become appendages of the Internet. Throw in trends like collaboration and big data analysis, and all those bits of data become more dynamic than something in a file cabinet. It is fluid and being entered from many points.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Managing all that data should be a good business.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The problem for everyone is price. Google and Amazon have for years decimated competition in their respective fields of Internet advertising and retailing. As the two companies move to dominate cloud computing, including online storage, they are turning that relentlessness on each other.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In March, Google celebrated the unification of several cloud computing services with price cuts of 68 percent for most customers, to 2.6 cents a gigabyte a month, about one-quarter the price of Dropbox’s premium consumer service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services, which had cut prices at least four times since 2008, responded with cuts of its own, including one to 2.75 cents a gigabyte for large amounts of storage, and just a penny a month for data used less frequently. It has made further price cuts on other types of storage since then. Many expect Microsoft, which runs its own big cloud business, called Azure, to follow with similar cuts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even by the standards of computing, where services seem almost invariably to become cheaper and faster, storage prices have had an exceptional fall. The first gigabyte storage device in 1980 typically cost $120,000 and weighed 550 pounds. Amazon’s cloud-based storage might cost 12 cents a year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">None of the smaller online storage companies doubt that Amazon and Google can make seemingly impossible pricing moves. Both companies also have a scale that means even the tiniest profit can be huge. A.W.S. says that almost all of Netflix, and Amazon itself, is inside its cloud, along with hundreds of other substantial companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple’s iCloud storage service and other parts of Apple, along with operations at several large banks, run inside A.W.S., say individuals familiar with the service who asked not to be identified by name so they could sustain relations with the powerful cloud company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon would not comment on confidential customer agreements. An Apple spokesman noted that Apple had its own data centers in four locations in the United States and said ‘‘the vast majority’’ of data in services like iTunes, maps and the App Store runs on Apple’s computers. Apple uses other facilities as well, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google does not have anything like the Amazon customer list, but its computer network is probably the largest corporate network in the world. It includes custom-made computing and power systems and several thousand engineers to keep it running. According to one person knowledgeable about the system, Google spends about $2 billion a quarter on its computing infrastructure.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google would not comment on its costs. In an email, Tom Kershaw, a product manager for Google’s cloud service, predicted more cost cutting. ‘‘As more customers store more information, for longer, we’re able to make gains in efficiency and pass these savings along to the customer.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both Box and Hightail now say they assume that they will offer customers unlimited storage free and push their costs into the prices they charge for other services. ‘‘At this point, it’s better just to say ‘unlimited,’’’ Mr. Levie said. ‘‘The thing to do is take into account why someone is storing something online and what their needs are.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Box has hired people with specialties in health care, media and entertainment, hospitality and retailing. Dropbox still has supposed limits on storage in its business offering, but they start at a terabyte, or 1,000 gigabytes, and customers can upgrade from there with seemingly no fee.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This niche approach could work, provided the big companies do not go after these industry-specific storage markets or build more consumer-friendly service offerings. Mr. Levie said he thought that was unlikely. ‘‘No one is going to build Google Health Care,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Kershaw of Google differed. ‘‘Industry-specific solutions are the wave of the future and a key part of what Google is building for our customers,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document INHT000020140824ea8p0003p</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_047.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark88">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</a><a name="bookmark89">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">German Authors Join Protest Over Amazon&#39;s Tactics in E-Book Dispute</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MELISSA EDDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,209 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">18 August 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 7</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BERLIN -- Taking a page from their colleagues across the Atlantic, more than 1,000 writers from Germany, Austria and Switzerland have united to vent their frustration over the tactics Amazon is using against the Bonnier Group and the authors who are published under its name.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The writers, supported by several hundred artists and readers, have signed an open letter to Amazon, the online retailing giant, accusing it of manipulating its recommended reading lists and lying to customers about the availability of books as retaliation in a dispute over e-book prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Amazon&#39;s customers have, until now, had the impression that these lists are not manipulated and they could trust Amazon. Apparently that is not the case,&#39;&#39; read the letter, which was to be sent to Amazon and was to appear in leading publications in Austria, Germany and Switzerland on Monday. &#39;&#39;Amazon manipulates recommendation lists. Amazon uses authors and their books as a bargaining chip to exact deeper discounts.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Signed by leading German-language authors like Elfriede Jelinek, a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2004, and the popular crime novelists Ingrid Noll and Nele Neuhaus, the letter accused Amazon of taking longer to deliver books published by Bonnier, making false statements about whether the books were available and pulling the authors of those books from recommended reading lists.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Unfortunately, the American company refuses to accept our traditional cultural values, because it only thinks in purely economic terms,&#39;&#39; Ms. Noll said. &#39;&#39;We have to stand together and defend our values.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s dispute with Bonnier, based in Sweden, over e-book prices echoes a continuing fight between Amazon and the publisher Hachette in the United States. But unlike in Amazon&#39;s dispute with Hachette, which has attracted comments by late-night television hosts and rants on social media, German authors have largely kept silent at the urging of publishers, many of whom did not wish to complicate already strained negotiations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The decision to publish the letter was made weeks before the annual book fair in Frankfurt, which starts a new season of price negotiations. Gerhard Ruiss, of the IG Authors Austrian, the Interest Group of Austrian Authors, which also signed the open letter, said the action was only the first step to raise readers&#39; awareness about the issue. Other steps will include discussions and demonstrations at the fair, which takes place in October.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In response to the authors&#39; complaint, Amazon pointed at publishers, contending that their terms were unfair. Bonnier &#39;&#39;offers most of its titles under conditions that make it significantly more expensive for us to sell a digital version, as compared to a printed edition,&#39;&#39; Amazon said by email. &#39;&#39;E-books can and should be offered cheaper than printed books, and this should also go for the prices at which booksellers buy from publishers.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The authors released a digital version of the letter on Friday, posting it at a site created for the protest, fairer-buchmarkt.de. By late Saturday, more than 1,000 authors had signed, said Nina George, one of the organizers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. George said the organizers rushed to put up the site after some German publications leaked the story, resulting in an overwhelming response.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Regula Venske, secretary general of the German chapter of PEN International, an association of writers, helped spread the word. &#39;&#39;We wanted to give it enough time for more authors to voice their support, but it has taken on a life of its own,&#39;&#39; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many points included in the German letter echoed those raised by more than 900 writers in the United States as part of Authors United, such as encouraging readers to write directly to Jeff Bezos, Amazon&#39;s chief executive and founder. The German-language authors also suggested sending a note to Ralf Kleber, head of Amazon Germany, to urge the retailer to &#39;&#39;stop using books and authors as hostages and instead ensure a lively and honest book culture.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The literary culture in Germany and Austria differs profoundly from that in the United States or Britain, in that pricing is protected by laws that forbid deep discounting, or other purely commercial practices. Many authors fear Amazon will use its dominant position to seek to overturn these laws.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ruiss said authors and publishers in Austria had long been uneasy with the methods Amazon uses to gain customers. The most recent dispute over e-book pricing has only exacerbated a strained relationship.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We have had difficulties with Amazon like with no other retailer,&#39;&#39; Mr. Ruiss said. &#39;&#39;From the beginning, they have always demanded special conditions that squeezed the publishers.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unlike the situation in the American market, which is dominated by the big five publishing houses -- HarperCollins, Penguin Random House, MacMillan, Hachette and Simon &amp; Schuster -- the legal protection of book prices in many German-speaking countries means that many smaller, specialty and boutique publishers continue to thrive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That diversity is reflected in the 1,001 signatories, which include first-time authors, writers of best sellers, science writers, poets and even some writers who publish directly through Amazon&#39;s electronic publishing platforms.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ms. George, a novelist and columnist, said that when she read the letter from the American authors she decided that German authors needed to take similar action. She and three other writers organized a German letter under the banner, &#39;&#39;Authors for a Fair Book Market.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She emphasized the neutral approach by the group, which does not aim to attack Amazon, but seeks to raise awareness of the effect of the price wars on authors, many of whom fear a loss of Germany&#39;s special protections if books become simply a commodity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We are not against Amazon, but for a fair book market, which means that Amazon is not our main enemy, but their methods are really bad and unfair,&#39;&#39; Ms. George said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The German Publishers and Booksellers Association submitted a complaint to the German antitrust authority in June, claiming that Amazon&#39;s monopolylike position in the e-book market violates competition law. The European Commission has opened a preliminary investigation into the complaint, the association said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the meantime, Amazon has continued to expand within Germany, its largest market outside the United States. The company plans to open two logistics centers across the border in Poland next month, stoking fears that it will later force distributors to deliver books to the Polish centers, only to have them sent back to customers in Germany.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Such moves do little to calm German anxiety over Amazon&#39;s unbridled position in the domestic book market. Alexander Skipis, president of the publishers&#39; association, said he hoped the letter would increase awareness of what was at stake.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It shows the public and politicians around the world that this is about more than a dispute over price conditions,&#39;&#39; Mr. Skipis said of the letter. &#39;&#39;This is about maintaining a book culture that requires a certain protection and cannot be regarded from a purely commercial point of view.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Elfriede Jelinek; Amazon has grown in Germany, its largest market outside America, with this distribution center in Brieselang. It plans to open two logistics centers across the border in Poland next month.

Wendig, whose books are published by Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing, is hard to quote briefly, but </a><a href="http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2014/08/09/in-which-amazon-calls-you-to-defend-the-realm/" class="s1" target="_blank">one recent post</a> <span style=" color: #000;">has the headline “In Which Amazon Calls on You to Defend the Realm”:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I’m pretty sure — though it may be a hallucination! — that last night Amazon wrote me, a KDP author-publisher, to get me to… I think ding-dong-ditch Hachette?

Books compete against mobile games, television, movies, Facebook, blogs, free news sites and more. If we want a healthy reading culture, we have to work hard to be sure books actually are competitive against these other media types, and a big part of that is working hard to make books less expensive.”</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2014/07/30/the-amazon-e-book-price-fandango-in-which-a-corporation-shares-its-opinion-because-apparently-corporations-have-those-now/" class="a" target="_blank">Then </a><a href="http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2014/07/30/the-amazon-e-book-price-fandango-in-which-a-corporation-shares-its-opinion-because-apparently-corporations-have-those-now/" class="s1" target="_blank">he analyzes the statement</a> <span style=" color: #000;">:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Books are not other things, so how do you compare? Facebook is free, so should books be free? I can kill two hours on Facebook easy, just by tripping and falling into a rage-hole. Oh, but wait, a Blu-Ray or digital download of a new movie probably $19.99, bare minimum, and that’s only two hours long. A book will last you more than that so … should the book be $19.99? Or maybe a little less, in order to compete? $14.99, maybe. It’s an odd point to make and does little to enforce the argument that e-books should be cheaper just as it would be a bad argument in terms of demanding e-books be more expensive. It’d be like saying ice cream should be cheaper because soup is cheaper.”</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://medium.com/%40jakedfw/making-sense-of-amazon-hachette-6ef55a961cbe" class="a" target="_blank">Jake Kerr, </a><a href="https://medium.com/%40jakedfw/making-sense-of-amazon-hachette-6ef55a961cbe" class="s1" target="_blank">, a science fiction writer, argues that Amazon is acting the way it is</a> <span style=" color: #000;">not because it is a big bad monopoly, which is what some of its opponents say, but because its position with e-books is so fragile.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple, Google and Microsoft will all aggressively try to compete with Amazon on e-books if they think it is worth their while, Mr. Kerr says. So Amazon has a difficult balancing act: warding off other tech companies by making the e-book business so low margin as to be not worth pursuing, while simultaneously not drowning in losses itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this analysis, Amazon has been good for e-book publishers and authors. They benefit from the aggressive discounting — selling more while Amazon takes the hit on margins.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the retailer succeeds in lowering the price of e-books while getting a bigger cut, Mr. Kerr writes, it can shore up its own margins while reducing the gross revenue in the market. That might keep out Apple and the others. It also might help the consumer, even if the real point is corporate preservation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Kerr concludes that “the one thing that Amazon can do that will substantively hurt Hachette is to stop discounting their books.” Late last week, as it happens, Hachette authors started complaining that the minimal discounts on their books were vanishing entirely.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140815ea8f0025v</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_050.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark94">B</a><a name="bookmark95">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">CASH REGISTER IS NEXT TARGET FOR AMAZON</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MIKE ISAAC</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">42 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14 August 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe king of online retail is flexing its muscle to win over Mom and Pop.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, the online retail giant, on Wednesday announced its own take on a credit card reader, pushing the company into the crowded and complicated world of mobile payments. Already, many companies are elbowing one another to win the trust -- and millions of business transactions -- of small and medium retailers the world over.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new product, Amazon Local Register, is a black, compact rectangular card reader stamped with Amazon&#39;s logo across the front. The $10 device plugs into a merchant&#39;s smartphone or tablet, and works in conjunction with a smartphone app to process and track all of a merchant&#39;s business transactions. It also comes with an enticing offer: lower processing fees.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The device is a new stomping ground for Amazon, which has expanded its online storefront over the years to include goods of nearly all sorts -- books, furniture and electronics, to name a few. While many of the products on Amazon.com are sold directly by Amazon, which is based in Seattle, the site also lists products sold and shipped by smaller retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And that, some analysts say, is why this move was not entirely unexpected.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;So much of this is about Amazon building platform lock-in,&#39;&#39; said Heath Terry, an Internet analyst with Goldman Sachs, who said the Local Register card reader was just one more component filling out an entire suite of offerings for the small businesses that sell goods on Amazon.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;If you&#39;re a third-party seller on Amazon&#39;s site that&#39;s using them for one thing, ultimately you&#39;re using Amazon for everything,&#39;&#39; Mr. Terry said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This should all sound familiar. Square, the San Francisco payments start-up valued at $5 billion, has offered its sleek version of a mobile card reader since 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PayPal, eBay&#39;s payments division, which processed $55 billion in transactions last quarter, offers a similar device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And then there are the huge incumbents like Verifone, which has sold its own terminals to merchants of all sizes for decades.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So by most measures, Amazon is late to the game. And yet no company with a mobile card reader has emerged as a clear winner. Amazon could push its way into the market with its own set of attractive incentives for small businesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For instance, Amazon is offering early adopters an especially low processing fee on each credit card swipe processed. If a merchant signs up before the end of October, each swipe will cost 1.75 percent of the total transaction, a deal that will last until the end of 2015.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is a full percentage point below Square&#39;s cut, which is 2.75 percent per swipe, and less than PayPal&#39;s 2.7 percent charge as well. Even after the promotional deal expires, Amazon will charge merchants 2.5 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is classic Amazon. With its low rate, the company is most likely losing money on transactions it processes, according to Colin Sebastian, an Internet analyst with Baird Equity Research.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;In typical Amazon fashion, they&#39;re using price as a motivator,&#39;&#39; Mr. Sebastian said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s pretty obvious in this case that they&#39;re losing money on the swipes at least.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is similar to the company&#39;s strategy with Kindle Fire tablets and smartphones; while Amazon makes little to no money on selling the Fire devices, each one acts as a portal to Amazon&#39;s retail universe, where customers are encouraged to spend more money buying goods online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But a better rate does not necessarily guarantee it success. As competition has increased, payments companies have expanded the scope of their services, aiming to attract merchants with more than just a lower transaction cut on credit card swipes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both Square and PayPal, for instance, offer lending programs for merchants looking to expand their operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This week, Square started an appointment scheduling service for businesses. And this month, Square acquired Caviar, a start-up that provides food delivery service to small restaurants that do not otherwise offer it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We&#39;ve long been focused on building a complete register service for local businesses,&#39;&#39; a Square representative said in a statement. &#39;&#39;This reinforces our mission and shows the demand for all of our services.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some businesses may be reticent to sign up for Amazon&#39;s new reader, lest they hand over scores of information to the online retailer. Packaged with its new card reader, Amazon&#39;s Local Register software will manage detailed data on a merchant&#39;s overall business operations, including sales trends and volume. That is the kind of data set that could help Amazon operate more successfully in the long run.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;That&#39;s always the threat of doing business with Amazon,&#39;&#39; Mr. Terry said. &#39;&#39;If I&#39;m really successful selling on Amazon, there&#39;s a pretty good chance that one day they&#39;ll end up competing with me.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

It was Colin Sebastian, an analyst with Baird Equity Research -- not &#39;&#39;Mr. Baird&#39;&#39; -- who said: &#39;&#39;In typical Amazon fashion, they&#39;re using price as a motivator. It&#39;s pretty obvious in this case that they&#39;re losing money on the swipes at least.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Amazon Local Register, a $10 device, plugs into a smartphone or tablet to process and track a merchant&#39;s transactions.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon must be spooked by the idea of writers massing against it, because over the weekend it launched its own counterrevolutionary force.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer created a group called Readers United to pressure Hachette, the fourth-biggest book publisher in the United States, in its dispute with Amazon over the price of e-books. The group is a response to Authors United, created by the novelist Douglas Preston to persuade Amazon to stop withholding books from sale when it negotiates with publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The confrontation is, some people in publishing argue, a struggle over the future of reading in our time — or at least the future of Amazon and the big New York publishers, starting with Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Authors United ran an advertisement in The New York Times on Sunday, supplying readers with the email address of Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos. Amazon’s plan for action mimicked Mr. Preston’s. In a web posting and a letter sent out to its Kindle authors, Amazon asked people to write to Hachette’s chief executive, Michael Pietsch, and provided an email address.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just to make sure the letter writers stayed on message, Amazon offered a list of talking points. The first one, alluding to the 2012 Justice Department antitrust suit against Hachette, was, ‘‘We have noted your illegal collusion,’’ always an icebreaker in these circumstances.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon then repeated its argument that e-books should be less expensive and charged those who think otherwise with trying to thwart history. And it provided a list of recommended reading, most of which was written by people published by Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette declined to say how many emails Mr. Pietsch was receiving but said he would be replying to all of them with a letter of his own. The letter, which was released to the news media, said more than 80 percent of the publisher’s e-books were $9.99 or less.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This dispute started because Amazon is seeking a lot more profit and even more market share, at the expense of authors, bricks and mortar bookstores, and ourselves,’’ Mr. Pietsch wrote.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon declined to say how many emails Mr. Bezos was receiving. Writers who wrote him said they received no immediate reply.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The freshest part of Amazon’s call to arms was the history lesson. It recounted how the book industry hated mass-market paperbacks when they were introduced in the 1930s and said they would ruin the business when they really rejuvenated it. Unfortunately, to clinch its argument, it cited the wrong authority:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The famous author George Orwell came out publicly and said about the new paperback format, if ‘publishers had any sense, they would combine against them and suppress them.’ Yes, George Orwell was suggesting collusion.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This perceived slur on the memory of one of the 20th century’s most revered truth-tellers might prove to be one of Amazon’s biggest public relations blunders since it deleted copies of ‘‘1984’’ from readers’ Kindles in 2009.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A moment’s web searching would have revealed to the Amazon Books Team, which is credited as the source of the Hachette post, that it was wildly misrepresenting the intent of this ‘‘famous author.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Orwell wrote that line, he was celebrating paperbacks published by Penguin, not urging suppression or collusion. Here is what the writer actually said in The New English Weekly on March 5, 1936: ‘‘The Penguin Books are splendid value for sixpence, so splendid that if the other publishers had any sense they would combine against them and suppress them.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Orwell then went on to undermine Amazon’s argument for cheap e-books. ‘‘It is, of course, a great mistake to imagine that cheap books are good for the book trade,’’ he wrote, saying that the opposite was true.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The cheaper books become,’’ he wrote, ‘‘the less money is spent on books.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instead of buying two expensive books, he said, the consumer will buy three cheap books and then use the rest of the money to go to the movies. ‘‘This is an advantage from the reader’s point of view and doesn’t hurt trade as a whole, but for the publisher, the compositor, the author and the bookseller, it is a disaster,’’ Orwell wrote.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s post gave Orwell a big weekend on the Internet. ‘‘Altering Orwell’s words to fit your agenda seems rather ... Orwellian,’’ Josh Centers, a tech writer, said in a Twitter message. ‘‘Only a fool or a businessman would twist that quote so completely,’’ wrote John Biggs in TechCrunch. Glenn Fleishman, a technology journalist, addressed Amazon directly via Twitter: ‘‘He was using irony. It’s a literary device. You sell books. What is wrong with you.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a related development, it became widely known over the weekend that Amazon was in a dispute with yet another supplier, this time Disney. Amazon was doing the same thing with the movie studio that it did with Hachette: preventing customers from preordering physical copies of yet-to-be-released content.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Preorders are a way for an entertainment company to gauge demand. Consumers have increasingly been trained to want something the moment it becomes available. When customers lose the ability to order ahead, the companies worry, they might never bother to buy at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In several cases, as with the latest Muppets movie, the Amazon page offered to email a potential customer when the movie was released. But in at least one case, there seemed to be no product page at all for a physical copy of a movie. ‘‘Captain America: The Winter Soldier’’ is available for preorder as an Amazon Instant Video, but there are no pages for a Blu-ray disc or a DVD. It was unclear whether the pages had been taken down, or never posted.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s selective sales practices bring Orwell to mind again.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In ‘‘1984,’’ the Records Department is charged with rewriting the past to fit whomever Oceania is currently fighting. There are ‘‘armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall.’’ In its skirmish with the publishers, Amazon appears to be wielding its technology in bold ways that Orwell would surely recognize.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman did not respond to questions about Orwell or ‘‘Captain America.’’ Disney did not return calls for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140811ea8c00038</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_053.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark100">B</a><a name="bookmark101">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">IN A FIGHT WITH AUTHORS, AMAZON CITES ORWELL, BUT NOT QUITE CORRECTLY</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">66 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11 August 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, has a growing cloud computing business and a hunger for American companies. And soon, it will most likely have a large amount of cash. Will it take on the American cloud giants?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It would be an amazing change from the way cloud computing seems to be developing. Public cloud computing is the rental of infrastructure, like raw computing power and online data storage, and sophisticated applications. It is a multibillion-dollar business, expected to grow much bigger, and is currently led by Amazon Web Services, or AWS; Google; and Microsoft Azure. IBM and others also have designs on the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To date, all of the big global players are United States companies. In a recent evaluation of the cloud infrastructure business, analysts at the technology research firm Gartner counted 15 companies. Just two, Dimension Data and Fujitsu, were not American firms. There was no mention of Alibaba.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of Alibaba&#39;s proposed public offering, Alibaba had revenue of $102 million from cloud and infrastructure sales last year. That was an increase of 26 percent from a year earlier. That is not the 50 percent annual growth seen at AWS, perhaps, but not bad.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So why isn&#39;t Alibaba an international cloud contender? Particularly since, as The New York Times reported last week, it has sunk a fortune in American tech companies. Not to mention that at least one of the companies high in Gartner&#39;s estimation, Rackspace, told the S.E.C. in May that it had hired Morgan Stanley to find it a partner or acquirer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A spokesman for Alibaba, citing the company&#39;s quiet period ahead of its I.P.O., declined to comment on its plans. But people with knowledge of the company said that Alibaba, like other possible Chinese contenders, seemed to have its hands full just handling its China business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Alibaba&#39;s cloud business was formed in 2009. Like AWS, it began as a way of serving the company&#39;s own online commerce and payment businesses. Its external customers are mostly small and medium Chinese companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Chinese website for the service, Aliyun.com, lists mostly Chinese mobile and gaming companies as customers. It also provides online stores for Microsoft and Apple in China. In all, Alibaba says that one million customers tap into its cloud, either directly or through a reseller of computing services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In other ways, however, the company is a laggard, with just three large data centers in China and a smaller one in Hong Kong. AWS, by comparison, has 25 core regional data centers globally, which are backstopped with 52 smaller &#39;&#39;edge locations&#39;&#39; around the world. Another regional facility is being developed in China.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In terms of performance, Alibaba cannot come close. For a Chinese site, it does impressive work, handling $5.8 billion in commerce on China&#39;s heaviest shopping day. The Alibaba S.E.C. filing says its cloud does 3.6 million computing transactions a minute. That sounds like a lot, until you consider that the AWS databases alone handle</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.5 million transactions a second.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Like Baidu and Tencent, two other big Chinese online companies with cloud businesses, Alibaba&#39;s focus for now seems to be on mainland China, possibly as a place to learn the business before moving farther out.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like Alibaba, Tencent recently opened a data center in Hong Kong. Politically, Hong Kong is China&#39;s special administrative region; practically, it can be a midway point between international and domestic commerce. From there, the probable growth would be in Asia, where China has many existing commercial relationships, or Africa, still mostly open territory for cloud computing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In other words, the American cloud companies should not have to worry in the short term. Further out, however, it&#39;s likely that the Chinese clouds will have a lot of paying customers in the domestic market to fuel additional expansion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Out here in the woods, at the end of not one but two dirt roads, in a shack equipped with a picture of the Dalai Lama, a high-speed data line and a copy of Thoreau’s ‘‘Civil Disobedience,’’ Amazon’s dream of dominating the publishing world has run into some trouble.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Douglas Preston, who summers in this coastal hamlet, is a best-selling writer — or was, until Amazon decided to discourage readers from buying books from his publisher, Hachette, as a way of pressuring it into giving Amazon a better deal on e-books. So he wrote an open letter to his readers asking them to contact Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief, demanding that Amazon stop using writers as hostages in its negotiations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The letter, composed in the shack, spread through the literary community. As of early in the past week, 909 writers had signed on, including household names like John Grisham and Stephen King. It was scheduled to run as a full-page ad in The New York Times this Sunday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon, unsettled by the actions of a group that used to be among its biggest fans, is responding by attacking Mr. Preston, calling the 58-year-old thriller writer ‘‘entitled’’ and ‘‘an opportunist,’’ while simultaneously trying to woo him and his fellow dissenters into silence.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Preston is unswayed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Jeff Bezos used books as the cutting edge to help sell everything from computer cables to lawn mowers, and what a good idea that was,’’ he said. ‘‘Now Amazon has turned its back on us. Don’t they value us more than that? Don’t they feel any loyalty? That’s why authors are mad.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This latest uproar in Amazon’s three-month public battle with Hachette comes at a vulnerable moment for the Internet giant, which is rapidly transforming itself into an empire that not only sells culture but creates it, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon does not want to be seen as hostile to content creators, one of the four groups it says on its investor relations web page it is expressly set up to serve. But it also has to make enough of a profit to satisfy investors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is a complicated balancing act. Amazon just surprised Wall Street by saying it might lose more than $800 million this quarter, potentially wiping out its profits for the last three years, partly because creating video content is expensive. The prospect of this unexpected loss has raised questions about whether Amazon’s money-losing ways are finally catching up with it — and whether that is the real reason it is making new demands on publishers like Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has been forced to shed its longtime practice of refusing to comment on anything. Asked about the writers’ rebellion, it issued a statement that put the focus back on Hachette, bringing up the United States Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Hachette and other publishers in 2012: ‘‘First, Hachette was willing to break the law to get higher e-book prices, and now they’re determined to keep their own authors in the line of fire in order to achieve that same end. Amazon has made three separate proposals to take authors out of the middle, all of which Hachette has quickly dismissed.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Preston pointed out it was Amazon that put the authors in the line of fire in the first place. Russell Grandinetti, Amazon’s vice president for e-books, has called Mr. Preston twice in recent weeks, trying to get him to endorse the company’s proposals. The most recent proposal would have Amazon selling Hachette books again, but with Hachette and Amazon giving their proceeds to charity.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No thanks, Mr. Preston said. A proposal that weakens Hachette by cutting its profits was not in the interests of Hachette’s authors. But he took the opportunity to ask Mr. Grandinetti why Amazon was squeezing the writers in the first place. His response, according to Mr. Preston: ‘‘This was the only leverage we had.’’ Amazon declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Preston dismisses Amazon’s suggestions that he is a ‘‘human shield’’ for Hachette, one of the Big Five publishers in the United States. He and the other writers say they are acting independently. Most, in any case, are not published by Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Preston is not sure how he has found himself in charge of a group calling itself Authors United. ‘‘I don’t like fighting,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other writers who signed the letter include Robert A. Caro, Junot Díaz, Malcolm Gladwell, Lemony Snicket (the pen name of Daniel Handler), Michael Chabon, Michael Lewis, Jon Krakauer, Scott Turow, George Saunders, Sebastian Junger, Philip Pullman and Nora Roberts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘We feel strongly that no bookseller should block the sale of books or otherwise prevent or discourage customers from ordering or receiving the books they want,’’ the letter states.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some writers wholeheartedly supported the letter but were afraid to sign, Mr. Preston said. A few signed it and then backed out, citing the same reason. The Times ad, which cost $104,000, was paid for by a handful of the more successful writers. Mr. Preston’s longtime writing partner, Lincoln Child, is among those with qualms. ‘‘I am very apprehensive,’’ Mr. Child said. ‘‘Not all David and Goliath stories end happily for the little guy. But I think Doug did the right thing.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon supporters point to a rival petition on Change.org. It is a rambling love song to the retailer. Signers sometimes append invective denouncing the New York publishers for having the audacity to reject novels. ‘‘There is something wrong with a system that picks those who use their elitist ideas of art to choose who is published,’’ reads a comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The petition has 7,650 signatures. By comparison, a 2012 Change.org petition calling on Amazon to ban the sale of whale and dolphin meat drew over 200,000 signatures.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Preston is not one of those writers who checks his Amazon ranking on a regular basis, or even totes up his sales. He would rather be writing. But he recently thought he should get some numbers from Hachette. They came in the other morning, and they seemed worth sharing with his wife, Christine.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">About half his book sales used to come from Amazon. But since the retailer started discouraging orders, his paperback sales are down 61 percent and his e-book sales are down 62 percent. His last novel, written with Mr. Child and published by Hachette in November, was ‘‘White Fire.’’ A week before publication, 25,000 Amazon customers had ordered a copy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Their new novel, ‘‘The Lost Island,’’ came out Tuesday. It had only a few thousand pre-orders, all made before Amazon lowered the boom on Hachette and stopped selling forthcoming Hachette books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Preston, a photographer, studied the bleak sheet. ‘‘It’s gotten personal,’’ she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Are you worried?’’ Mr. Preston asked. ‘‘Because you should be. What if Amazon says, ‘Why should we sell Doug Preston’s books? He’s a thorn in our sides.’ Guess what? All this goes away.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is a lot to go. The shack itself is negligible, but the house a few steps away is splendid. It is set on 300 acres owned by the Preston family for much of the past 100 years. Amazon has tried to use Mr. Preston’s success against him.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">‘‘It makes me laugh,’’ he said. ‘‘Tech company billionaires are calling a mere writer ‘rich.’ I think they’re rattled.’’ Document INHT000020140808ea890005u</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_056.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark106">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark107">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Dispute Between Amazon and Hachette Takes an Orwellian Turn</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">616 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9 August 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

It also provided a list of recommended journalism on the topic — a very selective list.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For readers who are not quite sure exactly what to write to Hachette, Amazon included a list of talking points. The first one is, “We have noted your illegal collusion,” always an ice-breaker in these sorts of chats.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer argues that people against e-books are against the future, and talks about how the book industry hated cheap paperbacks when they were introduced in the 1930s, and said they would ruin the business when they really rejuvenated it. Unfortunately, to clinch its argument it cites the wrong authority:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The famous author George Orwell came out publicly and said about the new paperback format, if ‘publishers had any sense, they would combine against them and suppress them.’ Yes, George Orwell was suggesting collusion.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Could the Amazon Books Team, which is credited as the source of this post, have really written this? Because a moment’s Googling would have revealed that the team is misrepresenting this “famous author.”</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html" class="a" target="_blank">First, when Orwell wrote that line, he was celebrating Penguin paperbacks, not urging suppression or collusion. Does Amazon, which early in its e-book days </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html" class="s1" target="_blank">made copies of “1984″ vanish</a> <span style=" color: #000;">from Kindles after discovering it did not own the rights, really think George Orwell — of all people! — would want to suppress books?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here is what the writer said in the New English Weekly on March 5, 1936: “The Penguin Books are splendid value for sixpence, so splendid that if the other publishers had any sense they would combine against them and suppress them.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Get it? He liked them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Orwell then went on to undermine Amazon’s argument much more effectively than Hachette ever has. “It is of course a great mistake to imagine that cheap books are good for the book trade,” he wrote. “Actually it is just the other way about … The cheaper books become, the less money is spent on books.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instead of buying two expensive books, he says, the consumer will buy two cheap books and then use the rest of his money to go to the movies. “This is an advantage from the reader’s point of view and doesn’t hurt trade as a whole, but for the publisher, the compositor, the author and the bookseller, it is a disaster,” Orwell wrote.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The real problem, the writer argued in an essay a decade later, “Books v. Cigarettes,” was with the books themselves. They had a hard time competing against other media — a point people are still making in 2014.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“If our book consumption remains as low as it has been,” he wrote, “at least let us admit that it is because reading is a less exciting pastime than going to the dogs, the pictures or the pub, and not because books, whether bought or borrowed, are too expensive.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman did not respond to questions about whether Orwell was really advocating collusion and not, you know, joking.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140809ea89000gp</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_057.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark108">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark109">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Takes the Muppets Off the Shelf</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">326 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9 August 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

So he wrote an open letter to his readers asking them to contact Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, demanding that Amazon stop using writers as hostages in its negotiations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The letter, composed in the shack, spread through the literary community. As of this week, 909 writers had signed on, including household names like John Grisham and Stephen King. It is scheduled to run as a full-page ad in The New York Times on Sunday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/business/media/plot-thickens-as-900-writers-battle-amazon.html" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon, unsettled by the actions of a group that used to be among its biggest fans, is responding by attacking Mr. Preston, calling the 58-year-old thriller writer “entitled” and “an opportunist,” while simultaneously trying to woo him and his fellow dissenters into silence. </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/business/media/plot-thickens-as-900-writers-battle-amazon.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Read more »</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140808ea88000ul</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_059.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark112">finance</a><a name="bookmark113">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Uniting to tackle Amazon in books</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By ALEXANDRA ALTER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">734 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8 August 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">15</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google and Barnes &amp; Noble are joining forces to tackle their mutual rival Amazon, zeroing in on a service that Amazon has long dominated: the fast, cheap delivery of books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Starting on Thursday, book buyers in Manhattan, West Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area were to be able to get same-day deliveries from local Barnes &amp; Noble stores through Google Shopping Express, Google’s fledgling online shopping and delivery service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google Shopping, which began operations about a year ago, allows online shoppers to order products from stores like Costco, Walgreens, Staples and Target, and have them delivered to their doors within hours.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The partnership could help Barnes &amp; Noble make inroads into online sales while its brick-and-mortar business remains stagnant. The company has closed 63 stores in the last five years, including some in bustling areas of New York and Washington, leaving it with a base of about 660 retail stores and 700 college campus stores. Its Nook business fell 22 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to its most recent earnings report.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Michael P. Huseby, Barnes &amp; Noble’s chief executive, called the arrangement with Google ‘‘a test’’ and said that he viewed it as a way to increase the bookseller’s online reach and improve sales from its physical stores. ‘‘It’s our attempt to link the digital and physical,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon poses a persistent and growing threat to Barnes &amp; Noble. Its rise has contributed to lagging sales and diminished foot traffic in Barnes &amp; Noble’s physical stores, and it dominates the online market for print books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s popularity as an online shopping destination also has the potential to undercut Google’s lucrative search engine advertising business. By adding Barnes &amp; Noble to its list of 19 retail partners, Google is making a more explicit grab for Amazon’s turf. The partnership also comes at a moment when many authors and book buyers are frustrated with Amazon because of what they say are its punitive negotiating tactics in its standoff with the publisher Hachette over e-book pricing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Many of our shoppers have told us that when they read a review of a book or get a recommendation from a friend, they want a really easy way to buy that book and start reading it tonight,’’ Tom Fallows, director of product for Google Shopping Express, said by email. ‘‘We think it’s a natural fit to create a great experience connecting shoppers with their town’s Barnes &amp; Noble.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The competition to provide faster shipping has increased in recent years as retailers scramble to claim a piece of the growing e-commerce market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has already taken the lead in same-day delivery, and on Wednesday it said it had expanded its same-day delivery service to 10 cities from four. Its same-day service costs $5.99 for members of its Prime program, and $9.98 for others. Walmart and eBay have also begun same-day deliveries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instead of relying on warehouses full of merchandise, Google is using a fleet of couriers to collect products from local stores, sort and bundle them and deliver them within a three- to four-hour window selected by the customer. Delivery is free for subscribers to Google Shopping Express, and costs $4.99 per delivery, per store for others.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Membership is free for the first six months. Google has not announced its subscription fee.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble stores participating in the partnership with Google, which include a store in Manhattan, one near Los Angeles and another in San Jose, Calif., will have someone on site to take online orders for books, toys, magazines and other items. Google will collect the orders and hand them to a courier. Barnes &amp; Noble stores have 22,000 to 163,000 titles, depending on the store size.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble is not processing Google Shopping orders on its own website, which also offers free express shipping to its members, and free shipping for orders that are $25 and up to everyone. Instead, it expects to pick up incremental sales from Google Shopping’s customers, said Jaime Carey, chief merchandising officer at Barnes &amp; Noble.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Google has their own vast customer base,’’ Mr. Carey said. ‘‘They’re going to be reaching a new customer for us.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140807ea8800037</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_060.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark114">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark115">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Daily Report: To Compete Against Amazon, Google and Barnes &amp; Noble Team Up</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">209 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7 August 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

Score another one for Seattle.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Tuesday, Oracle kicked off its new cloud computing technology center in Seattle. On hand were several recruiting executives; initially designed for 100 cloud engineers, the facility is expected to hire a lot more and serve as an education and training facility as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We expect this to be a big deal,&#39;&#39; said Prashant Ketkar, the head of products for Oracle&#39;s public cloud business. &#39;&#39;We intend to hire more and more.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is the biggest move by an established software applications company into Seattle, an important development if Seattle is to continue as the center of the cloud computing industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, of course, is based in Seattle, and has the headquarters of Amazon Web Services there. Across Lake Washington, Microsoft&#39;s cloud business, Azure, is a centerpiece of chief executive Satya Nadella&#39;s plans to spur Microsoft&#39;s growth. Google has also located its cloud business in Seattle, and Century Link increased its cloud presence there when it purchased Tier 3 last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These businesses, for Seattle the result of a combination of luck (Amazon and Microsoft were already there) and cooperation with local universities to build skills in areas like distributed computing, are for the most part about infrastructure, the management of lots of computer servers and networks. What Oracle is doing is more about building up the next level: software applications in the cloud.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Seattle has emerged with enough talented people, and a growing critical mass of application providers,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Ketkar, who worked on Azure in Seattle from 2008 to 2012. A few local applications companies, like Tableau Software and Concur, have done well in the cloud. Some other Silicon Valley companies, like Adobe, also have cloud businesses there.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oracle has about 120,000 people, so in itself 100 people in Seattle may not look like much. Mr. Ketkar said that the center would play an important role in changing Oracle itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The company will be very different in 10 years,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Sales is changing. The back end operations are changing. The size of deals, and who we work with in an organization. Everything is changing, not just on the technology side.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Seattle area is home to Amazon and Microsoft, two leaders in cloud computing, and now Oracle will add a tech center.

This year, helped by </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">the acquisition of SoftLayer</span>, a cloud start-up, and its own internal investment, it has moved sharply to the right, and higher, though it is not yet in the leaders area — the vision is strong, according to Gartner, but the execution still lags a bit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microsoft has moved up and to the right this year, into the leaders area. Last year, Gartner positioned Microsoft about where IBM is this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is still the star in Gartner’s chart of the cloud industry, some distance above Microsoft, the only other company in the leaders quadrant, among 15 companies Gartner included in the report.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Measurements in the cloud marketplace are tricky. Companies define their cloud businesses differently. And the big companies do not report their cloud revenue or profit separately, although they do occasionally make statements.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/technology/nokia-bolsters-microsoft-revenue-but-earnings-slip.html" class="a" target="_blank">When Microsoft</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/technology/nokia-bolsters-microsoft-revenue-but-earnings-slip.html" class="s1" target="_blank">announced its quarterly results</a> <a href="http://www.ibm.com/annualreport/2013/strategy-cloud.html" class="a" target="_blank">last month, it declared that its cloud revenue was running at a $4.4 billion annual rate. IBM said its cloud business was 50 percent higher so far this year, but did not supply a dollar figure. In </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">its annual report</span><span style=" color: #000;">, IBM said that its cloud revenue in 2013 was $4.4 billion. So this year would appear to be on track to be well north of $6 billion. Amazon’s cloud revenue, according to a recent estimate by Pacific Crest Securities, will reach $5 billion this year.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet the Microsoft and IBM numbers include things not in the Amazon estimates. Amazon’s cloud offers computing, storage and basic software tools used by engineers. But Microsoft and IBM add the software delivered to customers over the cloud, from spreadsheets to data-analysis applications. IBM’s revenue total, analysts say, also includes cloud-related services and even hardware used in setting up cloud computing environments that companies own themselves, so-called private clouds.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So comparing Microsoft and IBM’s cloud revenue to Amazon’s is not an apples-to-apples exercise. “For Microsoft, it is apples, oranges and pears,” said Lydia Leong, a Gartner analyst. “For IBM, it’s apples, oranges, pears, and the kitchen sink.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Yet it is the business beyond basic cloud computing — beyond the apples, to continue the analogy — that is most strategic to Microsoft and IBM. They have to convert their lucrative traditional software products to cloud offerings, and both companies are doing that aggressively.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microsoft and IBM may lose licensing revenue in the shift to the lower-cost cloud model, selling services rather than products. But if they don’t make the transition quickly, they will lose their most valuable asset — their long-term corporate customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cloud business today represents a tiny slice of the overall information technology market, but it is where the market is headed. Microsoft and IBM are eager to make that transition, and so are their clients. “In the past year, we’re seeing customers take the incumbents with them into the cloud,” said Robert P. Mahowald, an analyst at IDC.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For tech suppliers, big changes in the models of computing delivery and economics can be brutal or beautiful. In the 1980s and 1990s, the shift away from mainframes and minicomputers to personal computers tethered to corporate servers — known as client-server computing — nearly killed IBM, and it made Microsoft the dominant company of that era.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140803ea830002t</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_063.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark120">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark121">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Wants Cheaper E-Books.

That includes authors, publishers, customers and Amazon itself.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon also said that in addition to looking for cheaper books, it was asking for just 30 percent of the price of an e-book — far less than many in the publishing industry had feared the company was seeking in its dispute with Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At first blush, the retailer’s numbers, and its transparency, are encouraging.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But when you compare the market for e-books with other thriving digital markets, a larger question emerges: Why should the price of books be contractually enforced at all?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon says its data shows that e-books are “price elastic” goods — meaning that sales are sensitive to changes in price. Lower-priced e-books sell vastly more copies than high-priced books, so cheap books result in higher total revenue than if books were more expensive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company gives one example to support this argument. Based on its sales data, the firm says that an e-book that would sell 100,000 copies at $14.99 each would sell about 174,000 copies at the lower price of $9.99.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Total revenue at $14.99 would be $1,499,000,” the company notes. “Total revenue at $9.99 is $1,738,000.” Not only would authors and publishers get 16 percent more money at the lower price, they’d get 74 percent more readers. And each customer, of course, would get to spend a third less.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This sounds reasonable. But as you think about Amazon’s example, a couple of red flags pop up. Amazon declined to discuss its blog post on the record, but its post notes that its data is based on aggregate sales over a wide number of books in its Kindle store. This suggests that price elasticity for specific titles varies widely according to author, genre, length, difficulty and perhaps several other factors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This makes intuitive sense: Wouldn’t people pay more for a 750-page book by Stephen King than, say, a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">100-pager by an unknown debut novelist, Steven Qing? So while it may be true that $9.99 is better than $14.99 in general, certain books might make the most money at $10.99, $11.99, $12.99 — or even $2.99.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then there’s the question of the market for print books. Some of the people who are willing to buy an e-book at</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$9.99 but not at $14.99 might be coming over from the market for print books. So what if the increased revenue that authors and publishers get from low-priced e-books is outweighed by lowered revenue through cannibalized print sales? Amazon, which sells print books, would know whether this is the case, but its post says nothing about print titles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That gets to the larger problem with Amazon’s post. If the optimal market price for an e-book is $9.99, why does Amazon need to push for the lower price as part of a contract negotiation? Why can’t it let publishers set prices for themselves, preferably with the help of Amazon’s sales data, in the hope that they will eventually hit on the economically optimal price?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You might say that publishers can’t be trusted to act in their own interest. After all, a federal court has found</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/07/apple_e_book_price_fixing_federal_judge_rules_in_amazon_s_favor.html" class="a" target="_blank">that </a><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/07/apple_e_book_price_fixing_federal_judge_rules_in_amazon_s_favor.html" class="s1" target="_blank">publishers illegally colluded with Apple</a> <span style=" color: #000;">to collectively raise the price of books; that collusion resulted in higher</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">prices and lower sales of e-books. So perhaps Amazon feels that it needs to force publishers to settle on $9.99 in most cases because otherwise they’d shoot themselves in the foot.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That could be so. But it’s worth noting that contractually enforcing prices is something of an antiquated practice in digital marketplaces. Sure, when Apple set up the iTunes store, it created a set price for songs. But that was more than a decade ago; since then, digital marketplaces have matured, and we’ve seen a dizzying array of new business models. There are subscription-based music and media services, games funded by in-app purchases, social networks funded by ads, and hardware companies funded by e-commerce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of these work better than others. But it was only through experimentation that app makers figured out the best way to pay for their code. If Apple hadn’t allowed for this experimentation in its app store — if Steve Jobs had decided that all apps would cost $2.99, period — the app market wouldn’t be the thriving multibillion-dollar business it is now.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The same logic applies to books. I take Amazon at its word when it says it is interested in creating a thriving market for e-books. But the market for e-books is pretty new, and it stands to reason that the best business model for publishers, authors, readers, and booksellers has yet to be found. In the end, we may see many different ways to pay for books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Creating a single, typical price for e-books would stifle that potentially glorious future; $9.99 might work fine some of the time, but no price is perfect for everyone, always.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140801ea81001rz</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_064.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark122">Business/Financial Desk; SECT</a><a name="bookmark123">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Joins With Alloy Entertainment on Digital Publishing Imprint</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By ALEXANDRA ALTER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">324 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30 July 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times on the Web English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

When an angel investor offered $200,000 as seed money, they took only half and aimed for just 100 transactions a day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Snapdeal is now on track to handle more than $1 billion in sales this year for over 30,000 merchants across more than 500 categories of goods and services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We sell a sari every 12 seconds,” Mr. Bahl said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rise of Indian e-commerce — which has started to gain traction only in recent years — has captured the attention of international investors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=EBAY&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="a" target="_blank">This year, Snapdeal has raised $233 million, with about half coming from the American Internet company </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">eBay</span>.

Internet access has rapidly expanded, mostly through mobile devices, and Indians are now increasingly shifting daily activity online, like reading the newspaper, doing bank transactions and buying goods and services, from shoes to refrigerators (with installation included).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Billboards, text messages and emails bombard people every day with news of deep online-only discounts and special offers. E-commerce is growing at a compound annual rate of 34 percent, according to the Internet and Mobile Association of India, an industry trade group.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But online shopping remains a largely untapped market. While estimates of the total worth of India’s online retail industry vary greatly, most analysts figure that it accounts for less than 1 percent of the country’s $500 billion retail market, which is still mostly cash-driven.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/alibaba-said-to-plan-i-p-o-for-september/" class="a" target="_blank">Comparatively, China’s e-commerce sales are expected to top $180 billion this year, accounting for roughly 9 percent of the country’s retail spending, according to iResearch Consulting, which specializes in China’s Internet industry. The country’s largest online retailer, Alibaba, is </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/alibaba-said-to-plan-i-p-o-for-september/" class="s1" target="_blank">expected to go public in the coming months</a> <span style=" color: #000;">with an estimated value of more than $200 billion.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“There’s tremendous headroom still,” Mr. Bahl said. “I think 20 years from now, 20 percent of retail will be online.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet particularities to India’s shopping culture have impeded the industry’s growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By and large, India remains a bastion of the “kirana,” or neighborhood general store, as well as the roving hawkers, whose nasal cries carry the names of their wares through narrow lanes and up to the top floors of apartment buildings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most people tend to shop from sellers they know personally and live near, running grains of rice through their fingers and smelling the different varieties to determine their quality before, perhaps, moving to the next shop where they might closely inspect the stitch count of a new batch of shirts sold by the local ready-made clothes dealer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These entrenched habits, combined with the newness of the Internet and credit cards, have led to a trust gap between online retailers and their customers. To bridge it, the biggest names in e-commerce, including Snapdeal and Flipkart, allow customers to pay cash upon delivery for their purchases and let consumers return items at the very last second, even when the delivery person arrives at their door.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To address the widespread perception that the state’s postal service is unreliable, e-commerce players like Snapdeal, Flipkart and Jabong have developed their own delivery logistics companies. Snapdeal and others have built fulfillment centers and hired delivery workers to help ensure packages arrive in a timely fashion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The logistic network, in part, has helped Snapdeal court small business owners to its marketplace.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“In the early days,” Mr. Bahl said, “we were calling every family and friend who we knew was running a small business or wanting to start one, and for whom nationwide distribution would be a godsend. It was quite hard to convince them, given many of them hadn’t ever used the Internet themselves.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Momentum is now on the industry’s side. Mr. Bahl said that the company barely needed to recruit merchants any more, with 80 percent requesting to join Snapdeal. “Virality amongst small business owners is very acute,” Mr.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bahl said. “If one sees success, then word spreads really, really fast.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Once merchants join the site, Snapdeal works with them to develop their listings and bolster sales. When Rakesh Sareen, 29, started selling his line of traditional women’s clothing made of locally sourced materials, Snapdeal, as part of its services, promoted the introduction and covered the cost of a photo shoot and online catalog.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“They send out targeted newsletters, which promote our products, and their fashion category manager advises us on trends as well as updates on how certain products of mine are selling,” said Mr. Sareen, who had just returned from a trip to the villages where he buys woven fabric.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=AMZN&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="a" target="_blank">Looming large over the industry is last year’s entrance in India of </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Amazon</span>. Huge American online retailers like Amazon and eBay own marketplace platforms here, which, like Snapdeal and Flipkart, connect merchants with consumers. But the country’s regulations prevent Amazon and other overseas players from selling directly to consumers from their own inventory as they do elsewhere. Currently, foreign investment in multibrand retail is limited to 51 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are hints that the system may be changing, at least in the online space.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/narendra_modi/index.html?inline=nyt-per" class="a" target="_blank">The current government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, is perceived as backing small business owners who fear that opening retailing to foreign behemoths will put them out of business. But </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Narendra Modi</span>, India’s new prime minister, recently urged the industry to embrace change at a widely televised rally during his election campaign. “There is no need to fear global challenges,” said Mr. Modi, adding, “this is the age of online marketing, so accept modern science and make use of it.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://Medianama.com/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon in particular stands to benefit from any change to the existing rules. “Customer loyalty isn’t so strong yet, so it’s conceivable that Amazon would either look to buy big names here, or their expansion might just kill some of the smaller horizontals altogether,” said Nikhil Pahwa, the founder and editor of </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Medianama.com</span>, which analyzes India’s digital economy. On Monday, Amazon announced that it would open five new fulfillment centers across India to bring its nationwide total to seven.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a recent email, a spokeswoman for Amazon in India affirmed that the company was in “continual dialogue” with the government and that it strongly supports “opening up this sector” to foreign direct investment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bahl of Snapdeal seems unfazed. “It wouldn’t affect our marketplace,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Within the next year, he thinks Snapdeal’s network of sellers will reach 100,000, and the company plans to double its number of fulfillment centers as well as engineering employees. As for the prospect of competition from Amazon, he thinks that small businesses will congregate on marketplace platforms like Snapdeal’s so as to collaboratively compete against the giants.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We’re the ones who are going to help small businesses compete against Amazon,” Mr. Bahl said. “We are that platform.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140730ea7t0005m</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_066.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark126">BITS</a><a name="bookmark127">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Push From Gates Leads to Book&#39;s Unlikely Revival</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By STEVE LOHR</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">838 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">28 July 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 6</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

As I write this, &#39;&#39;Business Adventures&#39;&#39; is No. 3 on the Amazon list of top-selling books. It is No. 1 on Amazon&#39;s &#39;&#39;Hot New Releases&#39;&#39; list, and No.1 on its &#39;&#39;Most Wished For&#39;&#39; list.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The reason is an emphatic endorsement from Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and philanthropist, whose star power still burns bright in business circles. For years, Mr. Gates has recommended books including a summertime collection on his website, Gates Notes, with selections weighted toward science and policy subjects. But this summer, Mr. Gates declared that &#39;&#39;Business Adventures&#39;&#39; was his favorite business book, and that he has read it repeatedly since 1991, when his friend Warren E. Buffett gave him a copy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And Mr. Gates and his personal office decided to do more, undertaking a campaign to bring the book back to life and introduce it to a whole new audience.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Gates&#39;s emissaries got in touch with the Brooks family and a publisher, Open Road Media, which brought &#39;&#39;Business Adventures&#39;&#39; out as an e-book on July 8 (a paperback edition is scheduled for August). The Gates team, in doing a little research, found a &#39;&#39;whole army of Brooks disciples,&#39;&#39; said Andy Cook, a general manager in Mr. Gates&#39;s personal office. A few of them make appearances in a short video posted on the Gates website including Adam Gopnik, a writer at The New Yorker, and two of my Times colleagues, James B. Stewart and Diana B. Henriques.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">[Video: Bill Gates on his favorite business book. Watch on YouTube.]</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The video clip accompanies a lengthy appreciation of &#39;&#39;Business Adventures&#39;&#39; written by Mr. Gates. His personal office also got in touch with The Wall Street Journal, so his piece would be published in The Journal on Friday July 11. It was published on the Gates website, with the video, the following day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The piece on Gates Notes also offers a link to download a free chapter, &#39;&#39;XeroxXeroxXeroxXerox.&#39;&#39; (&#39;&#39;The headline alone,&#39;&#39; Mr. Gates writes, &#39;&#39;belongs in the Journalism Hall of Fame.&#39;&#39;)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales of the book began to take off with the weekend media blitz, and the momentum has continued, said Michael Palgon, senior vice president for business development at Open Road. The Brooks book was a good fit for the publisher, founded in 2009, with its focus on reviving worthy classics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Open Road had already been in contact with the literary agent representing the Brooks estate, but about two other Brooks books, &#39;&#39;The Go-Go Years,&#39;&#39; his best seller until now, and &#39;&#39;Once in Golconda,&#39;&#39; Mr. Palgon said. Word that Bill Gates was about to declare &#39;&#39;Business Adventures&#39;&#39; his favorite business book made it the priority.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The case Mr. Gates makes for &#39;&#39;Business Adventures&#39;&#39; is the value of understanding the patterns of history. Brooks chronicled the triumphs and travails in the 1950s and &#39;60s of Xerox, General Electric, Ford and other companies. His business articles were rich in social history, literary and artistic references, and wit.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the video interview, Mr. Gates called the Brooks articles &#39;&#39;particularly fun and interesting and instructive.&#39;&#39; They are stories with lessons. &#39;&#39;The rules of running a great business, of value creation,&#39;&#39; Mr. Gates said, &#39;&#39;are unchanged.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In one article, after a several thousand words of detailed description of Ford&#39;s Edsel, Brooks delivered his verdict on the costly dud, in signature John Brooks style. &#39;&#39;And yet, in a way, the Edsel wasn&#39;t so bad,&#39;&#39; he wrote. &#39;&#39;It embodied much of the spirit of the time -- or at least the time when it was designed, early in 1955. It was clumsy, powerful, dowdy, gauche, well-meaning -- a de Kooning woman.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite being the go-between, Mr. Gates and his office have no financial stake in the success of the rediscovered book. Still, the strong sales, Mr. Cook said, are &#39;&#39;a nice side benefit, an upside in celebration of his work.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To sample more John Brooks, The New Yorker has generously pulled three Brooks classics from its archives and posted them on its web site. His subjects are the playfully named retailer Piggly Wiggly , Ford&#39;s misadventure with the Edsel , and the high-handed Spanish financier Juan March.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">The Brooks pieces are terrific, but so are the cartoons and advertisements, enjoyed as delightful time capsules. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Warren E.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Writers are peeved at Amazon. Now, investors have become disgruntled too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company, which is embroiled in a very public conflict with the publisher Hachette, announced on Thursday second-quarter losses that were nearly double what analysts had predicted. It also warned that the third quarter would be worse. Much worse. That was enough to make the stock plummet in after-hours trading on Thursday, shaving more than $15 billion in value from the retailer, and it fell further in early Friday trading for a total drop of over 11 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon long ago proved that it could sell vast quantities of goods to tens of millions of people, and that it could simultaneously develop new businesses while innovating with old ones. What is a more debatable question is when — or even if — all those investments will truly pay off.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Skepticism is increasing,’’ said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. ‘‘It’s hard to have $20 billion in revenue and not make any money. It’s a real feat.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon officials exude a serene if vague confidence. ‘‘We’re not trying to optimize for short-term profits,’’ Thomas J. Szkutak, the chief financial officer, said during a conference call. ‘‘We’re investing on behalf of customers and share owners,’’ he said. ‘‘We’re fortunate to have these opportunities.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But even the analysts, who are generally enthusiastic about the company and its global ambitions, are asking slightly more pointed questions these days. For all these investments, one analyst asked Mr. Szkutak, why are sales not increasing even faster?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His answer: Just wait.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sales are rising at Amazon at a pace that retailers of its heft could never dream of achieving. The company said its revenue in the second quarter was $19.34 billion, up 23 percent from $15.7 billion in the period a year earlier. That matched analysts’ expectations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But losses mushroomed. Amazon had a net loss of $126 million, or 27 cents a share.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A year earlier, it lost $7 million, or 2 cents a share. Analysts had forecast a loss of 15 cents a share.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon long ago transcended its roots as a simple retailer. In recent weeks it introduced Zocalo, a document storage and sharing service that grew out of its fast-growing web services division. It began a program to let people read as many e-books as they want for a set monthly fee. And it is starting to ship its long-awaited entry in the smartphone sweepstakes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The phone, the result of years of development by thousands of Amazon programmers and designers, is meeting some resistance from reviewers.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investors received some bad news about the American shopper on Friday, driving down stocks and sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a loss for the week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two major companies -- the retail giant Amazon and the credit card processor Visa -- both said that the second half of the year was looking more troubled than originally expected. The cautious outlook from two companies so heavily exposed to consumer spending unnerved investors, causing the stock market to fall at the open and remain lower throughout the day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Visa put a lot of caution into the market this morning,&#39;&#39; said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Dow dropped 123.23 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,960.57. It&#39;s the first time the Dow has closed below the 17,000-point mark since July 9.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500-stock index fell 9.64 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,978.34, and the Nasdaq composite fell 22.54 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,449.56.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With Friday&#39;s selling, the Dow fell 0.8 percent this week. The S.&amp;P. 500 closed basically unchanged and the Nasdaq rose 0.4 percent this week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Visa was the biggest decliner among the blue chips, falling $7.97, or 3.6 percent, to $214.77. The company reported an 11 percent rise in quarterly profit but cut its full-year forecast on concerns about growth overseas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because the Dow is a price-weighted index, and Visa is the most expensive stock in the Dow, Visa had an outsize impact on it. Roughly 60 points of the Dow&#39;s decline can be attributed to Visa.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Investors have closely watched Visa ever since it went public in 2008. Credit cards that use Visa&#39;s payment system are in nearly every person&#39;s pocket, and each time a consumer buys a product with a Visa card, the company takes a small percentage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To see Visa give a cautious outlook is worrisome, Ms. Krosby said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Visa represents the consumer and the consumer is one of the most important pieces for the future of this economic recovery,&#39;&#39; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s quarterly results didn&#39;t help investor sentiment, either.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Its stock slumped 10 percent after the company late Thursday posted a much wider loss than analysts had forecast, hit by expenses. It is focused on spending the money it makes to expand into new areas and products, including a smartphone, the Fire, which started selling on Friday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon shares fell $34.60, or almost 10 percent, to close at $324.01, the biggest decliner in the S.&amp;P. 500 index.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investors retreated from riskier stocks and moved into traditional havens at times of uncertainty: bonds and gold. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note eased to 2.47 percent, from 2.50 percent late on Thursday, as demand for the government bond rose. Gold climbed $12.50, or 1 percent, to $1,303.10 an ounce.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There was some positive news on Friday from the Commerce Department, which reported that orders for durable goods increased 0.7 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis, after a decline of 1 percent in May. The strength last month came from solid gains in demand for commercial aircraft and machinery.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In other company news, Starbucks fell $1.71, or 2 percent, to $78.74, despite reporting a profit above analysts&#39; expectations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">El Pollo Loco stock surged $9.03, or 60 percent, to $24.03 on its first day of trading in the public market. The company, a grilled chicken restaurant chain, priced its shares at $15 a share late Thursday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CHART: The Dow Minute by Minute: Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals yesterday.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SAN FRANCISCO — Writers are peeved at Amazon. On Thursday, investors became disgruntled too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company, which is embroiled in a very public conflict with the publisher Hachette, announced second-quarter losses nearly double what Wall Street predicted. It also warned that the third quarter would be worse. Much worse.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That was enough to make the stock plummet in after-hours trading. Shares quickly fell 10 percent, shaving more than $15 billion in value from the high-flying retailer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon long ago proved that it could sell vast quantities of goods to tens of millions of people, and that it could simultaneously develop new businesses while innovating with old ones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What is a more debatable question is when — or even if — all those investments will truly pay off.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Skepticism is increasing,” said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. “It’s hard to have $20 billion in revenue and not make any money. It’s a real feat.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon officials exude a serene if vague confidence. “We’re not trying to optimize for short-term profits,” Thomas</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">J. Szkutak, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call. “We’re investing on behalf of customers and share owners,” he said. “We’re fortunate to have these opportunities.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But even the analysts, who are generally enthusiastic about the company and its global ambitions, are asking slightly more pointed questions these days. For all these investments, one analyst asked Mr. Szkutak, why are sales not increasing even faster?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His answer: Just wait. The Prime shipping club, for example, picked up more members in the second quarter than it did in the second quarter of 2013, and Prime members buy more than non-Prime members.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“There is some short-term impact but great long-term impact,” Mr. Szkutak said.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1951181&amp;highlight" class="a" target="_blank">Sales are rising at Amazon at a pace that retailers of its heft could never dream of achieving. The company said </a><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1951181&amp;highlight" class="s1" target="_blank">its revenue</a> <span style=" color: #000;">in the second quarter was $19.34 billion, up 23 percent from $15.7 billion in the period a year earlier. That matched analysts’ expectations.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But losses mushroomed. Amazon had a net loss of $126 million, or 27 cents a share. A year ago, it lost $7 million, or 2 cents a share. Analysts had forecast a loss of 15 cents a share.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which is based in Seattle, long ago transcended its roots as a simple retailer. In recent weeks it introduced Zocalo, a document storage and sharing service that grew out of its fast-growing web services division. It began a program to allow readers to consume as many e-books as they want for a set monthly fee. And it is starting to ship its long-awaited entry in the smartphone sweepstakes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The phone, the result of years of development by thousands of Amazon programmers and designers, is meeting some resistance from reviewers. They expected a device modeled after the Kindle tablet — functional and cheap, meant for the masses rather than trendsetters. Instead, the Fire phone is expensive and loaded with innovative features that, some reviewers said, do not work particularly well.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Szkutak declined to say whether Amazon would ever tell investors how many phones it sold. “I can’t comment on what we might or might not do here,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the current quarter, Amazon forecast that the losses would only grow. It expects a healthy rise in revenue but an operating loss of as much as $810 million, compared with a loss of $25 million in the third quarter of 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Szkutak listed some of the reasons: Amazon Web Services is in a price-cutting war with Google and others. Six new warehouses have opened. And the company will spend $100 million on new content to put on those phones and Kindles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Analysts are going to have to cut their forward outlook for profitability once again,” Mr. Gillis of BGC Partners said. Now that Amazon is in the content creation business, he added, the investments will be continuous. “You always need more episodes.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon shares have been under pressure for much of this year, and at one point were down about 25 percent. Investors apparently were a little weary of an endless cycle of investment with little to show for it. Recently, however, the stock has rebounded somewhat, to the point where it was only about 10 percent off its high.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The quarterly results are likely to reinforce claims that Amazon is squeezing book publishers to make up for all those investments — not, as the company claims, simply to benefit customers.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/technology/amazon-a-friendly-giant-as-long-as-its-fed.html?_r=0" class="a" target="_blank">During the quarter, </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/technology/amazon-a-friendly-giant-as-long-as-its-fed.html?_r=0" class="s1" target="_blank">a conflict with a major publisher</a> <span style=" color: #000;">, Hachette, went public. Amazon wants terms that Hachette feels are ruinous, and both sides are accusing the other of bad faith.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has come under pressure from many prominent authors, who accuse it of holding their books hostage. Other authors, who use Amazon’s self-publishing platform, have rallied to the retailer’s side.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whatever deal is ultimately struck, Amazon has been the loser in the public relations war.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is trying to get the dispute out of the news by making a deal with Hachette writers to give them the income they are losing now. The writers, however, are resisting being drawn further into the conflict.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Amazon has to change the way it thinks about its problem of trying to become profitable,” said Douglas Preston, a best-selling Hachette writer who has drawn up a petition that has nearly a thousand signatures, some of them well-known writers. They include Michael Chabon, Ron Chernow and Stephen King.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Amazon has enormous negotiating tools at its disposal, so why does it need to hurt authors, block the sale of books and inconvenience its own customers every time it runs into a rough patch negotiating with a publisher?” Mr. Preston asked.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/technology/personaltech/review-amazons-fire-phone.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon’s Fire Phone: Solid Device Beneath a Layer of Whiz-Bang Frippery</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/technology/amazon-a-friendly-giant-as-long-as-its-fed.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon, a Friendly Giant as Long as It’s Fed</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/technology/amazon-sued-over-billing-for-app-store-purchases.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon Sued Over Billing for App Store Purchases</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeffrey P.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How worried should Amazon be about its biggest hope for the future?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The giant online retailer has long said that its business selling computing services over the Internet, called Amazon Web Services, would eventually be the size of its mainstay business of selling stuff. In Thursday’s earnings report, however, growth of the business looks to have dramatically slowed in ways that hadn’t been seen before.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.W.S. is still tiny, compared with Amazon’s efforts in books, devices and reselling for others. Amazon does not break out figures for the web services, but company executives confirm that the division is by far the biggest part of the “other” category of its reported revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the second fiscal quarter, that segment was $1.2 billion, a rise of 37 percent from a year earlier. While impressive, that is far less than the growth rates of 50 percent or more recorded for multiple quarters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Compared with the first quarter, the sector actually shrank 3.2 percent. There hadn’t been a consecutive drop since the Amazon’s first quarter of 2013, and that was because of the heavy use the web service gets during the holiday season. This time, the money just didn’t come in.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What happened? Certainly, the law of large numbers says nothing can grow at nosebleed rates forever. This seems early in the game for a slowdown, however, since Amazon Web Services and its competitors think public cloud computing will eventually dominate the global computing business.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/googles-bigger-cheaper-cloud/" class="a" target="_blank">On an earnings call, executives said A.W.S. had to respond to price pressure. Specifically, in late March, Google announced </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/googles-bigger-cheaper-cloud/" class="s1" target="_blank">dramatic price cuts</a> <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" class="a" target="_blank">for its cloud business, which Amazon had to match. Microsoft, which offers a cloud business called </a><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" class="s1" target="_blank">Azure</a> <span style=" color: #000;">to the public, has a policy of matching Amazon, and followed suit.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.W.S., which still hosts the biggest corporate names in its public cloud, put a brave face on things. “AWS continues to grow strongly,” the company said in<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1951180&amp;highlight" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">its earnings release</span>, “with usage growth close to 90 percent year over year in the second quarter.” Amazon also said that A.W.S. staff “grew by thousands of employees this past year.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That may point to a deeper problem for A.W.S. than one-time price cuts. As public cloud computing moves from a service for developers and experimentation, and into a mainstream corporate business, getting business is going to cost more and take longer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Enterprise adoption is pretty tough for the public cloud — not because of security, but because of all the agreements that have to be made throughout an organization,” said Chris Gaun, global cloud strategist at Apprenda, a company that works with public clouds, including Amazon, to help companies move their computing there. “A real sales cycle is 12 months,” he said, compared with a few minutes when a single individual is signing up for A.W.S.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Price, people and time are costs that don’t play well for A.W.S., given the big competitors now seriously in the business. In its most recent quarters, Amazon had $5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Google had $59 billion, and Microsoft had $88 billion. IBM, which is also building a public cloud business, had $10 billion and a substantial amount of debt to service.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What Amazon’s service does have is a great roster of named clients, and probably lots more companies that aren’t ready to admit somebody else runs their computers. It has an enormous cloud and a technical understanding of global-scale computing that is second to none. All it needs is a bigger sales team for businesses and a way to get its checks signed faster.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140725ea7p002xo</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_072.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark138">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark139">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Daily Report: Amazon Makes Big Bets as Its Losses Swell</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">132 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">25 July 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Amazon.com unveiled its first smartphone last month, Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company’s chief executive, said the device had been partly inspired by one of his favorite childhood books, ‘‘Mr. Pine’s Purple House.’’ In the book, by Leonard P. Kessler, friendly old Mr. Pine grows weary of the 50 identical white houses, all in a line, on Vine Street. When he paints his house purple, his radical color scheme sets off an explosion of architectural innovation among his neighbors on Vine Street, which apparently has a pretty lenient homeowner’s association.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos’s message was clear: The smartphone industry had lately grown dull, and Amazon’s new offering, the Fire Phone, would be a fresh perspective on a now-boring device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But as I tested out the Fire Phone over the last week, Amazon’s comparison to Mr. Pine became less flattering. When Mr. Pine paints his house purple, he isn’t trying to improve how it functions. He’s merely trying to stand out from the crowd. Some of the Fire Phone’s headline features feel as if they were born of the same superficial impulse.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That’s especially true of Dynamic Perspective, a system of sensors and head-tracking cameras that allows the phone to respond to how users hold or look at it; in some apps, Dynamic Perspective provides a sensation of three-dimensional imagery. While technically impressive, the system rarely makes for a substantive improvement in how you’ll use your phone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s focus on the Fire Phone’s flashier side is unfortunate, because when I dug beneath the gimmicks, I found something better than 3-D heroics. The Fire Phone is uncommonly friendly and easy to use. As a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bare-bones smartphone, it should prove especially attractive to people who find themselves overwhelmed by today’s crop of do-it-all superphones. When you forget about its whiz-bang marketing, the Fire begins to stand out as something much more interesting: a phone for the rest of us.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let’s run through the basics. The Fire Phone, which is available only on AT&amp;T’s network, sells for $199 with a two-year contract, or for 24 payments of $27.09 with an AT&amp;T contract-free plan. That’s essentially the same price as other top phones, but Amazon throws in a couple of extras that make it a slightly more attractive deal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Phone has 32 gigabytes of storage, compared with half as much for similarly priced iPhones and Galaxys. It also comes with a year’s subscription to Amazon’s $99 Prime membership plan, which offers discounted shipping and free access to a large library of videos and TV shows. If you already subscribe to Prime, you’ll get an extra year free when you buy the phone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And unlike Apple and Samsung, Amazon throws in free, unlimited online storage for every single photo you take on the Fire Phone, an incredibly handy feature. Storage for videos, though, isn’t free.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Phone, which runs a heavily customized version of Google’s Android operating system, isn’t as powerful as other high-end phones. It doesn’t have as many apps as those for Android and Apple’s iOS, and it does not plug as neatly into Apple’s and Google’s content and services ecosystems.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Also, this phone is no looker. An indistinct slab of glass and plastic, the Fire Phone looks more like a minimalist prototype than a finished product.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But what the Fire Phone lacks in aesthetics and breadth of capabilities, it makes up for in ease of use. Consider the phone’s main app-launching interface, the ‘‘carousel,’’ which should be familiar to people who’ve used</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets. The interface constantly sorts your apps according to how recently you’ve used them. This let me navigate my phone very efficiently, often saving me from getting lost in a sea of apps — a common occurrence on most other phones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And if you ever get bogged down, stuck, lost or curious while you’re using the Fire Phone, help is never far. Just tap the Mayday button, and faster than you can believe it, a live, friendly human tech-support agent appears on your screen, ready to help. (Mayday made its debut on the Kindle Fire tablets last year.) I called up Mayday four times to pepper its agents with questions. In every case, a person popped up on the screen in under 10 seconds.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because the agent can see your screen (not your face), the calls were often productive. When I asked how to get the clock to stop disappearing from the top of my screen, an agent took me to the specific settings panel I needed. He saved me many minutes of searching, and perhaps even from throwing the phone at the wall in frustration.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Amazon’s agents can maintain their speed and friendliness, Mayday will prove to be one of the best features on any smartphone. It would instantly render tech support on most other phones embarrassingly obsolete.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Given the wonders of Mayday, unlimited photo storage and the carousel interface, it’s unfortunate that Amazon has decided to heavily promote the phone’s more out-there features, including Dynamic Perspective and Firefly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Firefly is an image- and audio-recognition system that lets the Fire identify real-world items. Point the Fire at a retail product, or even some text, and it will usually recognize what you’re looking at. But while Firefly is great at figuring out what it’s seeing or hearing, it doesn’t do much beyond that. When you identify an item, it presents a list of potential actions — at the top of the list, for most items, is the option to go to Amazon to buy it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">App makers can add to Firefly’s functionality: For example, MyFitnessPal lets you track your diet based on packaged foods you’ve recognized using Firefly. In time, we might see more such useful apps built. I’m hoping for a Firefly home inventory app. Right now, though, I don’t see much use for it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That brings us back to Dynamic Perspective, the 3-D head-tracking thing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At its best, Dynamic Perspective adds helpful gestures that allow you to get around the phone more quickly. Snap the phone to the right while you’re in the calendar app, you see your daily agenda; snap left and the agenda disappears. But these shortcuts are never reliable; a lot of times you’ll snap and nothing will happen, because the app you’re in isn’t coded for gestures.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As with Firefly, I expect that Dynamic Perspective might become more useful as developers add support. But right now, like a splashy new coat of purple paint, Dynamic Perspective feels like a difference merely for the sake of being different.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It suggests that Amazon can’t see its own best innovation: In the Fire Phone, Amazon has built a really nice, solid, plain white house. You’ll love living in it, if you can ignore all the purple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140724ea7p0003j</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_074.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark142">STATE OF THE ART</a><a name="bookmark143">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Promise, Under Layers of Gloss</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By FARHAD MANJOO</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,400 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24 July 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

Take Auto Scroll, which moves the text on your screen as you tilt the phone back and forth. Because Auto Scroll calibrates its scrolling speed according to how you&#39;re holding the device when you first load up an article, your brain will struggle to find a set rule about how much to tilt to get the right speed. Often I&#39;d scroll too fast or too slow.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Worse, if you put your phone down on a table while you&#39;re in the middle of an article, the scrolling goes haywire and you lose your place.

A book was prominently displayed and I began reading it and bought it. It is a wonderful book, but I would never have discovered it by browsing online. Our intellectual world will be impoverished if we ever lose bookstores and libraries completely. Since the feud with Hachette was publicized, I have stopped shopping at Amazon almost 100 percent and have allowed myself to purchase full-price books at my local bookstores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HDB, TENNESSEE</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whatever little profit is made off a book, I&#39;d rather Jeff Bezos &amp; Company invest it in the technologies of the future (like Amazon Web Services or another iteration of Fire) than have mom and pop put it under their mattress.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BILLYD, NEW JERSEY</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I love the mystery and special companionship offered by my favorite books. I have long worked for various publishers. I don&#39;t buy from Amazon. But after these announcements, I appreciate an article that attempts to portray the complicated scenario playing out in an industry that has clung to the romantic ways &#39;&#39;things used to be.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What responsibility do we as consumers play? If you go into a brick-and-mortar store and scan titles and then turn to buy them for a cheaper amount on Amazon, how can you blame Amazon for the disappearance of the old and for its dominance?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">JIMI, CINCINNATI</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve always had mixed feelings about Amazon, and this article reinforced that. Amazon has been an invaluable source for titles that are small-press, university press, scholarly, specialty, etc. Amazon could get things that brick-and-mortar stores couldn&#39;t. Amazon needs not to overreach. It needs to nurture those small, esoteric presses, because it might find that easy, reliable access to their titles is its unique selling point.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ACW, NEW JERSEY</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:sunbiz@nytimes.com" class="a" target="_blank">Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to </a>sunbiz@nytimes.com Document NYTF000020140720ea7k0004x</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_077.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark148">B</a><a name="bookmark149">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">AMAZON UNVEILS E-BOOK SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE, WITH SOME NOTABLE ABSENCES</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By ALEXANDRA ALTER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">69 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19 July 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After months of speculation, Amazon on Friday introduced a digital subscription service that allows subscribers unlimited access to a library e-books and audiobooks for $10 a month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The service, Kindle Unlimited, offers a Netflix-style, all-you-can-read approach to more than 600,000 e-books, including blockbuster series like &#39;&#39;The Hunger Games&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Diary of a Wimpy Kid,&#39;&#39; nonfiction titles like &#39;&#39;Flash Boys&#39;&#39; by Michael Lewis, as well as literary fiction and classics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So far, however, none of the five biggest publishers appear to be making their books available through the service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HarperCollins, Hachette and Simon &amp; Schuster, for example, are not participating, representatives from the three companies confirmed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Penguin Random House and Macmillan declined to comment, but a search on Amazon suggests that they are not making their books available.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a result, some popular titles were noticeably absent when the service began on Friday. Subscribers who want to read Laura Hillenbrand&#39;s &#39;&#39;Unbroken&#39;&#39; or Veronica Roth&#39;s &#39;&#39;Divergent&#39;&#39; will not find those books on Kindle Unlimited, at least not yet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Books that can be downloaded free as part of the subscription have an orange &#39;&#39;Kindle Unlimited&#39;&#39; icon under the title, along with a price tag of $0.00.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And because many authors publish with more than one house, subscribers may find that they can download certain books by, say, Margaret Atwood or Michael Chabon, but not other titles by the same authors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The introduction of the service comes as the relationship between the major publishers and Amazon has grown increasingly tense. The online retailer faces growing scrutiny for its dominance of the e-book market and its tough negotiating tactics with publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon and Hachette have been engaged in a lengthy public standoff over e-book terms that remains unresolved.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Among the imprints making their books available to the service are Scholastic, which published &#39;&#39;The Hunger Games&#39;&#39; series, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">News of Kindle Unlimited was reported earlier this week, when Amazon accidentally posted a promotional video for the subscription model. The video was quickly taken down from Amazon&#39;s website, but not before technology bloggers noticed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In offering the service, Amazon is entering an increasingly crowded marketplace. It will be competing with publishing start-ups offering similar services, like Scribd and Oyster, which charge a comparable subscription fee and have comparable digital libraries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Scribd has some 400,000 titles and charges subscribers $9 a month.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oyster has more than 500,000 titles available and gives readers unlimited access for $10 a month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With similar pricing models, the competition among e-book subscription services could come down to content and what books and authors are included.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Scribd&#39;s subscription service includes books from more than 900 publishers, including Simon &amp; Schuster, HarperCollins and Wiley.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Oyster offers titles from six of the top 10 American publishers, according to a company representative. Publishers receive payments whenever one of their books is downloaded and a certain percentage is read. &#39;&#39;An increasing number of people want to read in this way, just like they consume movies this way and listen to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">music this way,&#39;&#39; said Eric Stromberg, Oyster&#39;s chief executive. &#39;&#39;The unlimited model is just a better experience.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, Amazon is entering the arena with a huge advantage: its dominance within digital publishing, and its vast audiobook library, which it is bundling into the subscription service. Amazon owns Audible and is including more than 2,000 digital audio titles in Kindle Unlimited.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Through the company&#39;s Whispersync for Voice technology, users can toggle between digital audiobooks and e-books, alternately listening and reading without losing their place in the story.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Russ Grandinetti, a Kindle senior vice president, said in a statement that Kindle Unlimited was &#39;&#39;by far the most cost-effective way to enjoy audiobooks and e-books together.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;You can easily switch between reading and listening to a book, allowing the story to continue even when your eyes are busy,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A screen shot of books available on Kindle Unlimited, which does not appear to include titles from the top five publishers.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The number is in for how much Apple might have to pay to consumers to settle charges of conspiring with publishers to raise e-book prices: $400 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple last month agreed to settle a class action brought by attorneys general in 33 states. They had sought hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from Apple, claiming it had colluded with book publishers to inflate e-book prices. The class action was certified after Apple lost an earlier antitrust suit brought by the Justice</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Department in 2012. The government had accused Apple of working with the publishers to raise prices of e-books so that they could break free from the uniform $9.99 pricing that Amazon had set for new e-book releases.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The amount Apple would actually have to pay in the class action depends on the outcome of Apple&#39;s appeal in that antitrust suit. If Apple wins the appeal, it could pay nothing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Five major publishers, including Hachette Book Group, Simon &amp; Schuster and HarperCollins, had also been named in the government&#39;s antitrust suit, but they all settled before the trial. The judge presiding over the case, Denise L. Cote of United States District Court in Manhattan, rendered a guilty verdict last summer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eric T. Schneiderman, New York&#39;s attorney general, said the settlement reached with Apple was a victory for consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;This settlement proves that even the biggest, most powerful companies in the world must play by the same rules as everyone else,&#39;&#39; he said in a statement. &#39;&#39;In a major victory, our settlement has the potential to result in Apple paying hundreds of millions of dollars to consumers to compensate them for paying unlawfully inflated e-book prices. We will continue to work with our colleagues in other states to ensure that all companies compete fairly with the knowledge that no one is above the law.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple, in a statement, maintained its innocence and said it was still fighting the accusations through the appeal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We did nothing wrong and we believe a fair assessment of the facts will show it,&#39;&#39; said Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman. &#39;&#39;The iBooks Store has been good for consumers and the publishing industry as a whole, from well-known authors to first-time novelists. As we wait for the court to hear our appeal, we have agreed to a settlement, which is contingent on the outcome of the appeal. If we are vindicated by the appeals court, no settlement will be paid.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, the publishing industry continues to feel pressure from Amazon, which is by far the biggest retailer in e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The latest struggle between publishers and Amazon erupted into the public sphere in May. Amazon had sought concessions on book sales from Hachette, the fourth-largest publisher, which the publisher was unwilling to give. So Amazon sought to get its way by delaying delivery of Hachette books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vincent Zandri hails from the future. He is a novelist from the day after tomorrow, when Amazon has remade the worlds of writing, printing, selling and reading books so thoroughly that there is hardly anything left besides Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Zandri, an author of mystery and suspense tales, is published by Thomas &amp; Mercer, one of Amazon Publishing’s many book imprints. He is edited by Amazon editors and promoted by Amazon publicists to Amazon customers, nearly all of whom read his books in electronic form on Amazon’s e-readers, Amazon’s tablets and, soon, Amazon’s phones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His novels are not sold in bookstores, and rarely found in public libraries. His reviews are written by Amazon readers on the Amazon website. ‘‘Has a little bit of something for everyone,’’ one enthusiast exclaimed. ‘‘Heavy machinery, love, humor and mystery.’’ And his latest prize was an award from Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is the 21st-century equivalent of living in a company town, but Mr. Zandri, 50, is far from a downtrodden worker.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A few years ago he was reduced to returning bottles and cans for grocery money. Now his Amazon earnings pay for lengthy stays in Italy and Paris, as well as expeditions to the real Amazon. ‘‘I go wherever I want, do whatever I want and live however I want,’’ he said recently at a bar in Mill Valley, Calif., a San Francisco suburb where he was relaxing after a jaunt to Nepal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Mr. Zandri celebrates Amazon as the best thing to happen to storytellers since the invention of movable type, many other writers are denouncing what they see as its bullying tendencies and an inclination toward monopoly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From household names to deeply obscure scribblers, authors are inflamed this summer, perhaps more deeply divided than at any point in nearly a half-century. Back then, it was the question of being a hawk or dove on Vietnam. Now it is not a war but an Internet retailer and its unparalleled grip on the cultural machinery that is provoking fierce controversy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At first, those in the publishing business considered Amazon a cute toy (you could see a book’s exact sales ranking!) and a useful counterweight to Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders, chains willing to throw their weight around. Now Borders is dead, Barnes &amp; Noble is weak and Amazon owns the publishing platform of the digital era. The company founded and still run by Jeff Bezos dragged the publishers into modern times, forced them to digitize and urged on the United States Justice Department in its 2012 antitrust suit against the publishers and Apple. The conflict is unrelenting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The latest struggle between publishers and Amazon burst into public view two months ago, after the company began seeking concessions on book sales from Hachette, the fourth-largest publisher, which Hachette was unwilling to give. Amazon sought to get its way by delaying delivery of Hachette books, which roused Hachette’s authors. At this point, Hachette is losing sales and Amazon is reaping a considerable amount of bad publicity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All of this angst and arguing is pushing forward a question: Is the resistance to Amazon a last-ditch bid to keep the future of American literary culture out of the hands of a rapacious corporation that calls books</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘demand-weighted units,’’ or an effort by a bunch of dead-enders and snobs to forestall a future that will be much better for most readers and writers?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Zandri, who 15 years ago had a $235,000 contract with a big New York house that went sour, has an answer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Everything Amazon has promised me, it has fulfilled — and more,’’ he said. ‘‘They ask: ‘Are you happy, Vince? We just want to see you writing books.’ That’s the major difference between corporate-driven Big Five publishers, where the writer is not the most important ingredient in the soup, and Amazon Publishing, which places its writers on a pedestal.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It sounds alluring. This is the siren call of the modern tech colossus, not just Amazon but Google, Apple and Facebook — companies with bottomless pocketbooks and infinite ambitions: We’re building a better world. It will be dedicated to fulfilling all your needs and desires, including the ones you didn’t even know you had. Trust us.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Ruthlessly efficient’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon offers a vast array of goods. It is easy to order from. It is inexpensive. Everything arrives promptly. Customers love it. To no one’s surprise, Amazon is now one of the 10 biggest retailers in the United States, edging out the 99-year-old Safeway grocery chain.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Things are cheap for a reason, however. Inspired by Walmart, Amazon takes a famously hard line toward the people who make the stuff it sells.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Amazon is not evil, but it is ruthlessly, ruthlessly efficient,’’ said Andrew Rhomberg, founder of Jellybooks, an</p><ol id="l5"><ol id="l6"><li><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ook discovery site. ‘‘As consumers, we love Amazon’s efficiency and low prices,’’ he said. ‘‘But as suppliers, it is a toad that is hard to swallow.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Hachette, which publishes under the Little Brown and Grand Central imprints, the latest proposal was more elephant than toad. Both parties have declined to say exactly what Amazon is asking; the general belief is that it wants to increase its share of revenue on every e-book to 50 percent from 30 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon believes that publishers take too much of the money in producing a book and add too little value. In traditional publishing, the highest royalty a writer could get was 15 percent of the book’s price. With e-books, the royalty is 25 percent of net revenue, but Amazon feels that is still not enough. Mr. Zandri gets 35 percent, and self-published writers who use Amazon’s platform get more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Amazon believes the value exchange between publishers and authors is fundamentally broken,’’ said Scott Jacobson, who worked on the Kindle team at Amazon and is now at the Madrona Venture Group. ‘‘In a world where authors can hire their own editors, market their books through the web and social media, and get production and distribution through Amazon or other services, publishers will play a lesser role and their share of the economics will be diminished.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So writers should get more and publishers less, an assertion with which few writers would disagree. But Amazon also wants books to be cheap. This makes the pie smaller for everyone; Amazon argues that publishers will make up on volume what they lose on each sale.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In interviews, for the first time, executives from Amazon and Hachette explicitly described their positions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘If you charge high e-book prices, ultimately what you’re doing is making a slow, painful slide to irrelevancy,’’ said Russell Grandinetti, Amazon’s senior vice president for Kindle. ‘‘You have to draw the box big. Books don’t just compete against books. Books compete against Candy Crush, Twitter, Facebook, streaming movies, newspapers you can read for free. It’s a new world. It’s so important not to simply build a moat around the industry the way it is now.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon favors a price of $9.99 for many e-book titles, while Hachette and other publishers want to charge more. Sixty percent of Hachette’s e-book sales in the United States occur on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘For most books, $9.99 creates more total revenue than $14.99,’’ Mr. Grandinetti said. ‘‘That means $9.99 creates more total dollars to share with authors.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon also argues that publishers like Hachette are ungrateful. They are generally doing well now, thanks to the fact that e-book income is bolstering their bottom line. And who made that e-book income possible?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The truth is, Hachette is making dramatically larger profits on digital sales in large part thanks to Kindle, which has led the book business to a very healthy transition to digital, perhaps uniquely among media,’’ Mr. Grandinetti said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette says Amazon is merely trying to plug the holes in its bottom line.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This controversy shouldn’t be misinterpreted,’’ said Michael Pietsch, chief executive of the Hachette Book Group. ‘‘It’s all about Amazon trying to make more money.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He noted that Amazon was also trying to squeeze a large publishing group in Germany, Bonnier, for better terms. And Germany has fixed-price laws for books. That, Mr. Pietsch said, ‘‘is evidence that Amazon’s margins, not lower prices for consumers, are the crux here.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shares of Amazon have been under pressure this year. Amazon’s ambitions are not prompting the sort of unrestrained excitement on Wall Street that they used to.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘You always hear about never wanting to fight a two-front war,’’ said John Rossman, a former Amazon executive. ‘‘Well, Amazon is fighting a five-front war. They are investing in faster delivery, in a phone, in streaming video.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And they need more profits so they can continue their investments. That’s why there is a lot of pressure and negotiation.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Pietsch implied that Amazon was becoming desperate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘You can’t blame shareholders for demanding, at long last, a normal return on their investment,’’ he said. He added that even as Amazon was publicly accusing Hachette of refusing to negotiate last week, the publisher was putting its third proposal on the table, ‘‘by far the most generous to date.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">A deal soon would not be a surprise. A changing world</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It wasn’t always this hard for Amazon to bend publishers to its will.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A decade ago, when all books were physical, Amazon would run the numbers on its suppliers and would notice that one publisher was out of line — perhaps not paying the same amount to Amazon to promote its titles as some of its peers. So Amazon would talk with the publisher, try to make it see reason. Sometimes it did not.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Publishers were arrogant back then, said Randy Miller, who worked at Amazon from 1999 to 2006.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘A lot of people had been in business for 30 years,’’ he said. ‘‘They said: ‘This is what we’re going to publish, this is the price, you have no leverage, we control the content.’’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They had no clue that the world was changing. If a publisher did not give Amazon what it wanted, some of its books might disappear from the site. The writers would go wild.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘There were particular authors — we’d meet with them, have dinner with them — and they’d say, ‘I always check Amazon to see where my book is,’’’ Mr. Miller said. ‘‘They’d do it over their morning coffee. So you knew.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among the buttons Amazon could push: raise the price, recommend something cheaper, make the book disappear from promotional lists.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘If I pull you out of recommendations, customers aren’t going to see you at all,’’ said Mr. Miller, who remembers doing just that as the executive in charge of buying operations and vendor management for Europe. ‘‘It was the equivalent of a physical store putting you back by the discounted gardening equipment, where no one will ever find you.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Miller recalled a publisher taking six months to give in after this sort of treatment, which, he stressed, Amazon undertook only rarely.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Others saw the light faster.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘An author would see his ranking drop from 98 to 798, and the first thing he’d do is call his agent or publisher and say, ‘What happened?’’’ he said. ‘‘He held the publisher responsible and expected it to straighten this out.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the Hachette dispute, authors are also bent out of shape, but see the villain this time as Amazon. And they are complaining on Twitter and Facebook. As Mr. Miller put it, ‘‘It seems like every day another author gets a torch and heads to the castle.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This month, an unhappy group of writers issued a petition portraying the retailer as inconveniencing and misleading its own customers in the dispute, and thus ‘‘contradicting its own written promise to be ‘Earth’s most customer-centric company.’’’ In an emotional plea, the writers go on to accuse Amazon of betrayal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This is no way to treat a business partner,’’ says the petition, which has been signed by big-name authors like Stephen King and Robert Caro. ‘‘Nor is it the right way to treat your friends.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All of that criticism puts Amazon, which is positioning itself as the authors’ champion, in an awkward position. Last week, the retailer issued a sharply worded statement that Hachette ‘‘should stop using their authors as human shields.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Waiting for Moses’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smaller publishers are watching the standoff with anxiety, if not outright dread.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I feel as if we’re seeing a shift in the paradigm of publishing right before our very eyes,’’ said Marlie Wasserman, director of Rutgers University Press.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With titles like ‘‘Queering Marriage: Challenging Family Formation in the United States’’ or ‘‘Embodying Culture: Pregnancy in Japan and Israel,’’ Rutgers books tended to be invisible before Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Amazon has democratized shelf space,’’ Ms. Wasserman said. ‘‘In the last five years, not a single author complained to me that he couldn’t find his books at a physical store. That’s not where the action is anymore. I have to consider this every time I hear that Amazon is a bully.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is now responsible for 72 percent of Rutgers’s e-book sales, and a third of its $3 million in annual revenue. If only the retailer were a little easier to deal with: At Rutgers, as with most presses, communicating with Amazon means communicating through a web interface. There is no sense there is a person at the other end.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘We still pride ourselves on what we are doing — producing books that educate and create a public good,’’ Ms. Wasserman said. ‘‘To see that migrate into the hands of people who might not share our mission, or might not even be people, doesn’t say much for the future of American culture.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Academic houses traditionally sell their books, which are labor-intensive and printed in small quantities, for smaller discounts than general publishers do. Amazon will have none of that. ‘‘I offered them a 30 percent discount, and they demanded 40,’’ said Karen Christensen of Berkshire Publishing, a small academic house in Great Barrington, Mass.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, as usual, got what it wanted. Then it asked for 45 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Where do I find that 5 percent?’’ Ms. Christensen asked. ‘‘Amazon may be able to operate at a loss, but I’m not in a position to do that.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Christensen, like other publishers, complains that Amazon is very inventive with fees and charges that rapidly add up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But at the same time, Amazon has made itself essential to Berkshire, which publishes a three-volume dictionary of Chinese biography that sells for $595. Amazon is responsible for about 15 percent of Berkshire’s business. Ms. Christensen feels that she can’t leave Amazon but fears what else it might ask. ‘‘I wake up every single day knowing Amazon might make new, impossible demands,’’ she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has been reported to be seeking a new concession from publishers: If a customer orders a book and it is not immediately available, it wants the right to print the volume itself. An Amazon spokesman said it does not compel publishers to use the technology but offers it as a service. The customer wants the book immediately, so this makes obvious sense. But it chips away yet again at the publisher’s role.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘We’re all sort of looking around now, waiting for Moses,’’ said another university press director. As a measure of the anxiety inspired by Amazon, he was unwilling to make a statement as mild as this on the record.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moses would somehow make the Amazon juggernaut stumble, preserving the good parts while getting rid of the bad. Another antitrust suit, this time supporting the publishers rather than going after them, might fill the bill nicely.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I can see the emotional argument against Amazon, but I have a hard time seeing it prevail in court,’’ said Geoffrey A. Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law and Economics in Portland, Ore. ‘‘The</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">argument that there is an appropriate number of competitors, and one is not it, almost never flies in the United States.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">American publishers and booksellers are looking longingly at France, where different rules apply. In late June, the French Senate unanimously passed a law forbidding free shipping on books bought online. It was called the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">anti-Amazon law. ‘Soon, Amazon Mars’</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Three weeks ago, just before he went to Nepal, Mr. Zandri signed a contract with Amazon for a new novel, ‘‘Everything Burns.’’ His $30,000 advance was immediately deposited in his bank account. By this point, he said, he is earning about what a junior lawyer makes at a big firm. Call it a comfortable six figures annually.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It’s traditional publishing, but better, with a higher royalty rate,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m published by Amazon France, Amazon Germany, Amazon India. Soon, Amazon Mars.’’ The company sent him a free Kindle, and now he gets most of his books from Amazon. Most of the movies he watches come from the site as well. ‘‘Amazon touches every bit of my life,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Zandri is so embedded in Amazon that he recently started wondering about it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two years ago, he wrote about publishers on his blog: ‘‘I know I’m supposed to cry for these people, but they had a chance to survive and in fact thrive in today’s digital book publishing world, but they haven’t. And now they are going the way of the eight-track. Bon voyage.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s not that simple anymore.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Publishing is a shyster business,’’ he reflected. ‘‘One day it’s ‘You rock, bro,’ and the next day they’re not returning your calls. If I’m not moving books on Amazon, they’re not going to ask me back. It’s not a charity.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon looks so good because it has the rest of publishing to compete against. But if those publishers wither, maybe that would not be true.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Zandri can even conceive of publishing with a New York house again. They still provide some forms of legitimacy that Amazon does not, with independent reviews and a presence in bookstores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So in the Amazon-Hachette dispute, somewhat to his surprise, he is on no one’s side.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I don’t agree that the entire dismantling of the traditional publishing world in New York is the answer,’’ he said. ‘‘No one wants to hand Amazon a monopoly.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In some ways, this was not the best week for Amazon. The Federal Trade Commission sued it for improperly billing customers for games used by their children. And it continues to be enmeshed in a nasty public relations battle with the publisher Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon still has the drones. In a filing with the Federal Aviation Administration that got widespread attention Friday, Amazon asked for permission to test its drone delivery system outdoors, a practice that is banned for safety reasons.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Never mind for the moment the fact that the F.A.A. said a few weeks ago that there would be no commercial uses of drones in a memo that did not mention Amazon but pointedly excluded even the free shipping of items by drone. That&#39;s a lobbying battle for another day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Delivery by drone was first mentioned by Amazon last year on &#39;&#39;60 Minutes,&#39;&#39; and quickly became a viral sensation despite, or because of, the fact that it was unlikely to happen anytime soon. If nothing else, it was a vivid demonstration of Amazon&#39;s gift for showmanship.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the filing to Michael P. Huerta, the F.A.A. administrator, Amazon said that it should get an exemption from the rules because of the &#39;&#39;enormous consumer benefits&#39;&#39; of what it is calling Prime Air: getting stuff to people quickly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon said that if it did not get what it wanted, it would have to move the drone team to another country.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Of course, Amazon would prefer to keep the focus, jobs and investment of this important research and development initiative in the United States,&#39;&#39; the letter said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon stock shot up Friday faster than a you know what, jumping more than 5 percent. It was either the power of the drone or analysts&#39; reports predicting a good second quarter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020140712ea7c0004h</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_084.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark162">International Traveler leisure</a><a name="bookmark163">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Making downtown Las Vegas jump again</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By ELAINE GLUSAC</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">685 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11 July 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">20</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

Often, the charges were for digital goods like coins, clothing, clues or tools that help a player progress through a game.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jessica Rich, director of the agency&#39;s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a conference call on Thursday that Amazon&#39;s approach resulted in &#39;&#39;sticking parents with unexpected bills in the hundreds of dollars.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Rich said the charges led to &#39;&#39;thousands of complaints that we know of.&#39;&#39; In the discovery phase of its suit, she said, more complaints are likely to surface and the agency will be able to estimate more precisely the purportedly improper charges.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple faced similar accusations about its app store, and it settled with the F.T.C. in January, agreeing to better ensure parental approval of purchases and to pay at least $32.5 million in refunds to customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the conference call, agency officials said they could not comment on private negotiations with Amazon and why no settlement had been reached.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Ms. Rich said the F.T.C.&#39;s goals in both the Apple and Amazon cases had been to seek full refunds and require informed consent. In the Amazon case, the agency is striving for an outcome &#39;&#39;similar to the settlement with Apple,&#39;&#39; Ms. Rich said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last month, the F.T.C. informed Amazon that it planned to sue, unless the company agreed to a consent order modeled after the Apple settlement. In a letter, dated July 1 and addressed to Edith Ramirez, the F.T.C. chairwoman, Andrew DeVore, associate general counsel of Amazon, criticized the agency&#39;s &#39;&#39;unwillingness to depart from the precedent it set with Apple.&#39;&#39; The Amazon case, Mr. DeVore wrote, involved &#39;&#39;very different facts,&#39;&#39; so the company had &#39;&#39;no choice but to defend our approach in court.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After Amazon introduced in-app charges in late 2011, Mr. DeVore wrote, the company made several improvements. Yet even from the outset, he insisted, its approach was &#39;&#39;responsible, customer-focused and lawful.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In its suit, the F.T.C. rebuts that claim. The filing cites internal Amazon communications in December 2011 from an app store manager saying the in-app charges with few restraints were &#39;&#39;clearly causing problems for a large percentage of our customers.&#39;&#39; The manager called the situation a &#39;&#39;near house on fire.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon declined to comment beyond Mr. DeVore&#39;s letter.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has made a series of changes to its in-app purchases program. In March 2012, the company required a password for individual charges of more than $20, though it allowed unlimited purchases below that threshold, the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F.T.C. complaint said. Further restrictions came later.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the complaint said that it was not until June 2014, shortly before the commission voted to approve the suit, that Amazon changed its in-app purchase program to really obtain informed parental consent. That, Ms. Rich noted, was roughly two and a half years after the problem surfaced.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During that time, she said, parents who sought refunds faced an Amazon process that was &#39;&#39;unclear and rife with deterrents.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jessica Rich of the F.T.C.&#39;s consumer protection bureau.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A modest and geeky announcement by Google and a couple other big tech names on Thursday may be the summer’s biggest development in a continuing fight over the future of huge global computing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microsoft, IBM and Red Hat, along with others, are joining Google in creating open source software to manage computing workloads across thousands of computer servers. Amazon Web Services, by far the largest cloud computing company, was notably absent from the announcement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes" class="a" target="_blank">Called </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Kubernetes</span>, the software project draws on a former Google top secret: how the search giant efficiently built and deployed powerful applications like search, mail and maps over its cloud computing system, one of the world’s largest.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What Google kept proprietary it now hopes to sell to thousands of companies around the world as part of renting the public its computing power. So do Microsoft and IBM, with public clouds that chief executives at both companies say are crucial to their futures. Red Hat is a leading provider of services for the Linux computer operating system, which is used extensively in cloud servers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Some of the biggest enterprises in the world are throwing their hats into the ring,” said Miles Ward, an executive with Google Cloud Platform, Google’s cloud computing business. “We have built a stupefying amount of software using this.” Soon, he said, the rest of the world will, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kubernetes may also prove useful in smaller cloud systems operated by private companies, in particular for deploying applications and bridging private and public clouds. “We are big believers, long term, in public clouds,” Mr. Ward said, “but there is still a couple trillion dollars in gear sitting around doing computing inside companies.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That such computing infrastructure might be needed by a typical company says a lot about the scale of resources expected to be commonplace once things like big data analysis and managing billions of connected devices become commonplace in corporations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That Google and others will donate such things free may say even more about the competitive environment. At almost the same time as the Kubernetes announcement, Amazon Web Services was having a large meeting in New York, marketing its version of cloud computing, which downplays the idea that companies should even have their own data centers. So far, that approach has worked well, but Google, Microsoft and IBM are all pushing variants on a hybrid model.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Other companies say that everything is going to the public cloud — not in my lifetime,” said Paul Cormier, president of products and technology at Red Hat. “Red Hat and Google see things going in the same direction.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In an email, an Amazon spokeswoman said that the web service had its own management system for workloads, which automates most functions efficiently. She declined to comment on the competitive environment or whether Amazon’s would follow its competitors into a hybrid business.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/06/an-update-on-container-support-on-google-cloud-platform.html" class="a" target="_blank">There is another way in which the announcement could rock the status quo. Kubernetes manages so-called “containers” inside the cloud, used for running different applications. The idea is to use the computing power in each of a cloud’s processing units, sometimes hundreds of thousands of computing nodes, as efficiently as possible. Google</a><a href="http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/06/an-update-on-container-support-on-google-cloud-platform.html" class="s1" target="_blank">says it runs</a> <span style=" color: #000;">more than two billion containers a week for its services.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mesos.apache.org/" class="a" target="_blank">In this sense, containers are an improvement on virtualization, a means of increasing the efficiency of individual servers that remade the computer business a decade ago. Twitter and Airbnb already use an open source container software, called </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Mesos</span>, to run applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That suggests that, in the long run, well-managed containers could also prove a threat to virtualization, a money maker for both Microsoft and VMware, a multibillion-dollar subsidiary of the data storage giant EMC.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mesosphere.io/" class="a" target="_blank">“Virtualization no longer makes sense,” said Florian Leibert, co-founder and chief executive of </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Mesosphere</span>, a container management company that is also working on the Kubernetes project. “This is the way to run computing at a big scale.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Jason Zander, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s cloud business, said his company expected to keep using virtualization, as well as the bigger types of systems. “This won’t replace virtual machines,” he said. “There will be a spectrum of solutions.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In an email, a VMware spokesman said the company thinks its customers are “thinking/wanting to figure out how to utilize containers within their existing VMware context.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document NYTB000020140710ea7a000b5</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_088.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark170">edit</a><a name="bookmark171">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">The French do buy books.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the maddening things about being a foreigner in France is that hardly anyone in the rest of the world knows what’s really happening here. They think Paris is a Socialist museum where people are exceptionally good at eating small bits of chocolate and tying scarves.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In fact, the French have all kinds of worthwhile ideas on larger matters. This occurred to me recently when I was strolling through my museum-like neighborhood in central Paris, and realized there were — I kid you not — seven bookstores within a 10-minute walk of my apartment. Granted, I live in a bookish area. But still: Do the French know something about the book business that we Americans don’t?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I was in a bookstore-counting mood because of the news that Amazon has delayed or stopped delivering some books, over its dispute with the publisher Hachette. This has prompted soul-searching over Amazon’s 41 percent share of new book sales in America and its 65 percent share of new books sold online. For a few bucks off and the pleasure of shopping from bed, have we handed over a precious natural resource — our nation’s books — to an ambitious billionaire with an engineering degree?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">France, meanwhile, has just unanimously passed a so-called anti-Amazon law, which says online sellers can’t offer free shipping on discounted books. (‘‘It will be either cheese or dessert, not both at once,’’ a French commentator explained.) The new measure is part of France’s effort to promote ‘‘biblio-diversity’’ and help independent bookstores compete. Here, there’s no big bookseller with the power to suddenly turn off the spigot. People in the industry estimate that Amazon has a 10 or 12 percent share of new book sales in France. Amazon reportedly handles 70 percent of the country’s online book sales, but just 18 percent of books are sold online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The French secret is deeply un-American: fixed book prices. Its 1981 ‘‘Lang law,’’ named after former Culture Minister Jack Lang, says that no seller can offer more than 5 percent off the cover price of new books. That means a book costs more or less the same wherever you buy it in France, even online. The Lang law was designed to make sure France continues to have lots of different books, publishers and booksellers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fixing book prices may sound shocking to Americans, but it’s common around the world, for the same reason. In Germany, retailers aren’t allowed to discount most books at all. Six of the world’s 10 biggest book-selling countries — Germany, Japan, France, Italy, Spain and South Korea — have versions of fixed book prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even with the state’s help, French bookstores are struggling. Xavier Moni, co-owner of Comme Un Roman in Paris, says he can afford to give 5 percent off only every 10th purchase. More important than free shipping, he and others say, is that despite having extensive operations in France and elsewhere in Europe, Amazon pays taxes in Luxembourg, where corporate taxes are effectively low and in some cases largely avoidable. The European Union has begun an inquiry into Amazon’s taxes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, there does seem to be a link between fixed book prices and flourishing — or at least still-breathing — independent bookstores. In Britain, which abandoned its own fixed-price system in the 1990s, there are fewer than 1,000 independent bookstores left. A third closed in the past nine years, as supermarkets and Amazon discounted some books by more than 50 percent. ‘‘You’d have to be almost masochistic to go into a bookseller in the U.K. to buy a best seller,’’ Dougal Thomson of the International Publishers Association says.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What underlies France’s book laws isn’t just an economic position — it’s also a worldview. Quite simply, the French treat books as special. Some 70 percent of French people said they read at least one book last year; the average among French readers was 15 books. Readers say they trust books far more than any other medium, including newspapers and TV. The French government classifies books as an ‘‘essential good,’’ along with electricity, bread and water. (A French friend of mine runs a charity, Libraries Without Borders, which brings books to survivors of natural disasters.) ‘‘We don’t force French people to go to bookstores,’’ explains Vincent Montagne, head of the French Publishers Association. ‘‘They go to bookstores because they read.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">None of this is taken for granted. People here have thought for centuries about what makes a book industry vibrant, and are watching developments in Britain and America as cautionary tales. ‘‘We don’t sell potatoes,’’ says Mr. Moni. ‘‘There are also ideas in books. That’s what’s dangerous. Because the day that you have a large seller that sells 80 percent of books, he’s the one who will decide what’s published, or what won’t be published. That’s what scares me.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The French aren’t being pretentious or fetishizing bookstores. They’re giving voice to something we know in America, too. ‘‘When your computer dies, you throw it away,’’ says Mr. Montagne of the publishers’ association. ‘‘But you’ll remember a book 20 years later. You’ve deeply entered into a story that’s not your own. It’s forged who you are. You’ll only see later how much it has affected you. You don’t keep all books, but it’s not a market like others. The contents of a bookcase can define who you are.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The main thing my bookcase says about me is that I’m not French. While I love walking past those beautifully lit bookstores in my neighborhood, what I mostly buy there are blank notebooks and last-minute presents for children’s birthdays. Online retailers are a godsend for stranded expatriates. Like people everywhere who are fretting about Amazon’s global domination, I want to have my gâteau and eat it, too: the option to buy online, but the pleasure of browsing in a shop. And I don’t want every book purchase to feel like a political statement. French people like having books delivered to their doorsteps, too, and they’re starting to read more e-books (which are currently just 3 percent of the book market). Indeed, despite all their old-fashioned bookstores, they are aiming for something that sounds quite American: choice (here they call it équilibre — balance). Unlike us, they might actually get it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140709ea7a00060</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_089.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark172">B</a><a name="bookmark173">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">AMAZON ANGLES TO ATTRACT HACHETTE&#39;S AUTHORS TO ITS SIDE</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">55 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9 July 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

Amazon, in particular, was famous until very recently for saying as little as possible in the media. But as the dispute has dragged on, it is trying a new tactic.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For more than six months, Amazon has been trying to wring better e-book terms out of Hachette. The publisher, which is the fourth largest in the United States and whose imprints include Little Brown and Grand Central Publishing, is energetically resisting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has responded by delaying shipments of Hachette books and making it harder for customers to order them. Hachette authors have responded by publicly excoriating Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With its newest proposal, Amazon is trying to break the impasse by getting Hachette&#39;s writers to switch allegiances.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That would take the heat off Amazon, which has never suffered as much sustained criticism as it is getting now. Which might also be the reason Hachette summarily rejected it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The offer came in a letter to a few writers and agents from David Naggar, an Amazon executive who works with publishers and independent authors. It proposes &#39;&#39;a big windfall for authors&#39;&#39; by taking them &#39;&#39;out of the middle&#39;&#39; of the conflict. On Tuesday, Amazon sent the proposal to Hachette itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The proposal &#39;&#39;has several real benefits -- to motivate us and Hachette to reach an agreement sooner rather than later and to insulate the authors,&#39;&#39; said Russ Grandinetti, Amazon&#39;s senior vice president for Kindle content. &#39;&#39;It would make things better for readers, too,&#39;&#39; he added.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Roxana Robinson, president of the Authors Guild, dismissed the proposal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;If Amazon wants to have a constructive conversation about this, we&#39;re ready to have one at any time,&#39;&#39; she said in an email. &#39;&#39;But this seems like a short-term solution that encourages authors to take sides against their publishers. It doesn&#39;t get authors out of the middle of this -- we&#39;re still in the middle.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The standoff has prompted a debate over the future of books, reading and American culture. Many mainstream writers have rallied to Hachette&#39;s side, tweeting and editorializing and blogging against Amazon. Hundreds of writers, including Stephen King and John Grisham, have signed a petition, which maintains it is not taking sides but is clearly directed at Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We encourage Amazon in the strongest possible terms to stop harming the livelihood of the authors on whom it has built its business,&#39;&#39; it says. &#39;&#39;None of us, neither readers nor authors, benefit when books are taken hostage.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon has its own constituency. About 6,500 writers who use its system to publish their books have come up with their own petition on Change.org.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Major publishers like Hachette have a long history of treating authors and readers poorly,&#39;&#39; the petition proclaims. &#39;&#39;Amazon, on the other hand, has built its reputation on valuing authors and readers dearly.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Mr. Naggar&#39;s letter, Amazon took the opportunity to portray Hachette as unwilling to compromise or even talk to the retailer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We heard nothing from them for three full months,&#39;&#39; it says. &#39;&#39;After our last proposal to them on June 5, they waited a week to respond at all, promising a counteroffer the following week. We are still waiting a month later.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">It added, &#39;&#39;Unless Hachette dramatically changes their negotiating tempo, this is going to take a really long time.&#39;&#39; A Hachette executive familiar with the negotiations denied the publisher was unwilling to negotiate.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We made an offer in April that was the largest we&#39;d ever made any retailer, and in May made another that was higher still,&#39;&#39; said the executive, who refused to be quoted by name because of the negotiations. &#39;&#39;Both offers were rejected.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the evidence of their statements, the parties appear light-years apart.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon wanted to cut the publisher off entirely from &#39;&#39;its own revenue from e-books sold by Amazon, which would be a suicidal action,&#39;&#39; Hachette said. &#39;&#39;Once again, Amazon acknowledges that their unilateral actions, in trying to extract much higher terms from Hachette, are harming authors.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonsense, Amazon responded.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Hachette is part of a $10 billion global conglomerate,&#39;&#39; said Amazon, which will achieve $100 billion in revenue this year. &#39;&#39;It wouldn&#39;t be &#39;suicide.&#39; They can afford it.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many writers are in a third camp. Ms. Robinson, whose books are not published by Hachette, said that &#39;&#39;what writers want is a long-term healthy publishing ecosystem, not a temporary windfall.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That applies to both parties, she added. &#39;&#39;From our publishers we want a fairer share of e-book revenues; from Amazon we want an end to predatory practices that unfairly threaten their competitors, as well as the continued existence of the printed book.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Roxana Robinson, president of the Authors Guild, rejected Amazon&#39;s proposal, saying that writers did not want a &#39;&#39;temporary windfall.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020140709ea7900036</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_091.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark176">Technology</a><a name="bookmark177">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Principles Are No Match for Europe’s Love of U.S. Tech Titans Like Amazon and Facebook</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MARK SCOTT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,135 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7 July 2014 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014.

He enjoys peppering the staff with questions about what he should be reading next. But his visits, he says, are also a protest against the growing power of Amazon. He is bothered by the way the American online retailer treats its warehouse employees.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, as with millions of other Europeans, there is a limit to how much he will protest.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It depends on the price,” said Mr. Rosquin, 49, who acknowledged that he was planning to buy a $400 BlackBerry smartphone on Amazon because the handset was not yet available on rival French websites. “If you can get something for half-price at Amazon, you may put your issues with their working conditions aside.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Across Europe, love — or at least acceptance — often wins out in the love-hate relationship with American tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google. Despite their often vocal criticism of these behemoths, people in the region are some of the most active and loyal users of American social networks, search engines and</p><ol id="l7"><ol id="l8"><li><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">ommerce websites. They are often even more hooked on the services than Americans are.</p></li></ol></ol><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/technology/google-should-erase-web-links-to-some-personal-data-europes-highest-court-says.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Google now has an 85 percent market share</a> <span style=" color: #000;">for search in the region’s five largest economies, including Britain, France and Germany, compared with less than 80 percent in 2009, according to the research company comScore. Google’s share of the American market stands at roughly 65 percent.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/business/global/21iht-datatax21.html" class="a" target="_blank">Facebook — </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/business/global/21iht-datatax21.html" class="s1" target="_blank">the target of several government investigations</a> <span style=" color: #000;">for its tax practices in Europe — also has more than doubled its number of European users, to over 150 million, in the last five years, and the social network’s European user numbers now outpace American figures, according to the social media research company eMarketer.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">American tech companies operate seven of the 10 most visited websites in Europe, according to comScore statistics. Only Yandex and Mail.ru, a Russian search engine and an email site, and Axel Springer, the German publisher of Die Welt and Bild, make the list.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonetheless, from Spain to Sweden, many of Europe’s millions of Internet users regularly complain about the dominance of American tech companies, particularly about how their data is used and shared. It also leaves them wondering why so few homegrown tech companies are globally competitive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For many Europeans, the likes of Twitter and Amazon hold too much information about what people do online. That wariness has only grown stronger after the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about American intelligence agencies’ spying activities and perceived easy access to the world’s tech infrastructure.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In some ways, Europeans are pushing back.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last month, Google started removing some links to online search results after Europe’s highest court ruled that the company had to give people the right to request that information be taken down.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is finishing new rules — tougher than those currently in force in the United States — intended to strengthen the region’s privacy protections for online data.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But leave the clutches of the services they deride? No.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Stuart Turnbull, 42, a writer who lives two hours north of Edinburgh, a reliance on American tech companies has become the cost of doing business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Turnbull once tried to shut down his Facebook account after realizing that he was spending too much time sharing posts and comments. Yet as he looked to build contacts with other writers and editors around the world, Mr. Turnbull, who works from a home office in the small town of Crieff, soon changed his mind. He even opened a second Facebook account dedicated to his literary career.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While he remains concerned about how tech companies use his online data, the ability to tap into the global networks offered by the likes of Facebook and Twitter is too enticing a prospect to turn down.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I accept that my data may be mined,” said Mr. Turnbull, who says he is more worried about companies’ potentially abusing his information than about governments’ getting access to his online data. “It’s the price you pay for using these so-called free services.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In many ways, the American companies face little competition. For example, several regional e-commerce sites like the British fashion company ASOS have challenged Amazon but have yet to compete with the breadth of products — and discounts — offered by the American company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">European social networks, particularly in Germany, once dominated online communication but gradually fell out of favor as Facebook’s global reach grew.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Government efforts, including a French plan to create a state-backed search engine to compete with Google, have also failed to take off.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But not every European has succumbed to the dominance of the American tech companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Six months ago, Russell Albert, a 43-year-old British software engineer, started thinking that the ads displayed next to his Google search results were too closely based on his Internet search history. He switched to using smaller, lesser-known search engines and began looking for alternatives to other Google products, like its popular email service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surfing the web may not be as easy with these other services, Mr. Albert said, but he is still glad he switched. “I hated being completely Googled up,” he said. “I decided that I didn’t want to have all my eggs in just one basket.”</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/facebook-to-buy-messaging-start-up/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0" class="a" target="_blank">After </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/facebook-to-buy-messaging-start-up/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0" class="s1" target="_blank">Facebook’s purchase</a> <span style=" color: #000;">of the messaging service WhatsApp, rumors abounded that European users of the messaging service would flee, fearing that Facebook would gain access to their personal information despite reassurances from the company that it would keep WhatsApp user data separate.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://blog.whatsapp.com/613/500000000" class="a" target="_blank">Yet six months after the announcement of the deal, </a><a href="http://blog.whatsapp.com/613/500000000" class="s1" target="_blank">WhatsApp says its user numbers</a> <span style=" color: #000;">have increased to half a billion — many of them Europeans.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among them is Lara Goldsworthy, a 31-year-old marketing manager from Hamburg, Germany.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“WhatsApp would have been the first service that I would have left, but I didn’t,” said Ms. Goldsworthy, who added that many of her German friends — seemingly without irony — took to Facebook to complain about the social network’s acquisition of the messaging service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I realized,” she said, “that I had given up my privacy a long time ago.”</p><ul id="l9"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/business/international/google-to-guardian-forget-about-those-links-right-to-be-forgotten-bbc.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Google Reinstates European Links to Articles From The Guardian</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/technology/19iht-tax19.html" class="s1" target="_blank">European Countries Seek More Taxes From U.S. Multinational Companies</a></p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Guillaume Rosquin usually shops at local bookstores in Lyon, France, but said he would go to Amazon for lower prices. | Niels Ackermann for The New York Times | Russell Albert, a software engineer in London, said he stopped using Google products because of concerns about privacy. | Hazel Thompson for The New York Times</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020140707ea770005v</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 1/Image_092.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark178">You&#39;re the Boss</a><a name="bookmark179">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business Day; Small Business</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Learning the Secrets of E-Commerce in China</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DEB WEIDENHAMER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">781 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7 July 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

The company is the top player in an increasingly crowded and diverse Chinese online sales market that features corporations looking to order large quantities of manufactured goods; small business buying items in lots of, say, 25 pieces; and consumers looking for a single product.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.dhgate.com/" class="a" target="_blank">The online market includes both local competitors like </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">DHGate</span>, which sells goods for export from China, and international sites selling directly to Chinese consumers — including Amazon, which is beginning to gain mainland customers after a slow start.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are at least three major differences between American and Chinese online sales. Those differences illustrate both the challenges and the potential for growth in China.</p><ol id="l10"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Quality and returns. Most American retailers guarantee their products against defects and allow returns for various reasons, including the buyer simply changing his or her mind.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chinese retailers rarely allow for this scenario, so buyers must be very sure of what they are purchasing before they click “buy.” Also, while the sale of counterfeit products is rare in the United States, it is prevalent on Chinese sites. Buyers in China often pick an item with a midrange price instead of the lowest, because choosing the lowest price is seen as a tacit agreement to accept a knockoff.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Delivery. Except in a few larger markets, delivery in the United States is rarely made on the same day, and it can involve big fees. It is easy to buy something for $4.95 and pay $10 to have it delivered.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But in China, the efficient and inexpensive “kuai di” (pronounced KWHY-dee) express delivery services typically charge five to six renminbi — or less than $1 — payable in cash for same-day delivery. Buying something online is often both faster and cheaper than going to the corner store. Even businesses order big deliveries this way, leading to overloaded bicycles and electric scooters.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Communication. In America, online buyers often get most of the information about items they want to buy right on the merchant’s website, through photos, user ratings, videos and other descriptive details. Knowing that they can return anything they don’t like, buyers feel secure purchasing without further interaction with the seller.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In China, most purchases — even very small ones — are discussed via telephone, email or chat before the purchase is made. Negotiations and modifications are made before the order is placed. The sales process often involves as much labor as it would if it were done on a retail floor — all while trying to compete at a discounted rate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I buy most of my groceries online whether I’m in the United States or China. In America, the process takes 10 minutes, and groceries are delivered by the day’s end. In China, the ordering is simple but always involves many subsequent back-and-forth phone calls with the company that fulfills the order. Simple items like bread or bottled water can generate a call to discuss substitutions of brand or bottle size I will accept. The follow-up calls typically take up an additional half-hour.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I recently purchased a heating pad from an independent vendor on Taobao, an Alibaba site. After reviewing several options, I picked a midrange pad for about $16. It came promptly, and I happily snuggled in as it warmed</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">up. Ten minutes later, it quit working. Disappointed, I turned instead to the hands of a very good and inexpensive masseuse.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The next day, my office called the vendor. The representative apologized and sent me a replacement without requiring me to return the faulty product (much to the surprise of my team). I was encouraged and figured the initial item must have been a fluke. Two days later, after light use, the new pad also failed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of my colleagues called the company again. This time, the representative said I was using it wrong and that the company would not do anything to correct the problem. I am now on my fifth heating pad in China.

He enjoys peppering the staff with questions about what he should be reading next. But his visits, he says, are also a protest against the growing power of Amazon. He is bothered by the way the American online retailer treats its warehouse employees, </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Mark Scott reports</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, as with millions of other Europeans, there is a limit to how much he will protest.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It depends on the price,” said Mr. Rosquin, 49, who acknowledged that he was planning to buy a $400 BlackBerry smartphone on Amazon because the handset was not yet available on rival French websites. “If you can get something for half-price at Amazon, you may put your issues with their working conditions aside.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Across Europe, love — or at least acceptance — often wins out in the love-hate relationship with American tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a backlash against the retail giant Amazon, France is preparing to impose new restrictions this summer that would bar online merchants from offering free shipments of discounted books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">New legislation, designed to protect thousands of local bookstores, and nicknamed the anti-Amazon law, was passed last week by the French Senate. It will not formally take effect until after the president signs it, in the next two weeks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the state&#39;s culture minister, Aurélie Filippetti, has already publicly backed the measure, which has drawn support from conservative and liberal politicians. The minister called the ban &#39;&#39;a sign of the deep commitment of the nation to books.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokeswoman in France declined to comment about the measure, which has its roots in the 1981 &#39;&#39;Lang Law.&#39;&#39; Then, the culture ministry created fixed prices to help independent bookstores compete with chains. It permits book discounts up to 5 percent, which Amazon was giving along with free shipments -- offers that politicians considered a competitive advantage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With the new measure, online booksellers can offer the same discount, but must charge for shipping.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The passage of the law comes as Amazon is facing brush fires elsewhere from publishers in Germany, who accuse it of violating competition laws, and from editors in England who complain about new distribution terms that the company is imposing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With the French law, politicians like Brigitte Gonthier-Maurin, a senator, seized the opportunity to criticize the company for minimizing its taxes in its markets by setting up operations in Luxembourg.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette Book Group is bulking up and diversifying, steps that could improve its long-term negotiating position with Amazon, the giant online retailer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The publisher said on Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire the Perseus Books Group, the country’s sixth-largest trade publisher.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Michael Pietsch, Hachette’s chief executive, said in a phone interview that the deal was part of Hachette’s ‘‘strategic long-term plan to grow in the U.S. market,’’ and was not related to its monthslong standoff with Amazon over e-book pricing. Still, the acquisition could provide Hachette more leverage in its negotiations with Amazon because it will give the company control over more attractive books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It will also help Hachette diversify away from its dependence on fiction best sellers by adding more nonfiction and academic books, which are less dependent on Amazon for sales. (As a rule, fiction books sell more heavily in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-book form, which Amazon dominates, whereas nonfiction, academic and older books sell predominantly in print.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perseus, which has 12 imprints including Da Capo Press, Basic Books and Avalon Travel, has strength in a wide range of nonfiction categories, such as history, science and travel. It has a stable of prestigious authors, including two Nobel Peace Prize recipients, Leymah Gbowee and Muhammad Yunus. And it also produces popular inspirational fare; recent best sellers include ‘‘Finding Me,’’ the story of a woman held in captivity in Ohio for more than a decade, and ‘‘The Gifts of Imperfection,’’ a self-improvement book.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘They have been the most best-seller-dependent of the big five — this is a quantum leap for them in university bookstores and libraries,’’ Mike Shatzkin, chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a publishing consulting firm, said of Hachette. ‘‘The business they are best at is the highest-risk business, and this would give them a more stable and diverse base. In one fell swoop this broadens them enormously.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perseus also owns a strong backlist of 6,000 titles, which includes perennial sellers like ‘‘Friday Night Lights,’’ by Buzz Bissinger and ‘‘Skinny Bitch’’ by Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under the terms of the deal, Hachette would keep the Perseus publishing business, but it has signed a binding agreement to sell its distribution arm, including warehouses and sales force, to Ingram Content Group, a distributor. The price of the acquisition was not disclosed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette’s pricing dispute with Amazon has attracted much attention in the publishing world recently. As Amazon has grown to dominate the online book market, it has been demanding that publishers cut their prices and pay higher fees.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette has refused to meet Amazon’s demands in the current round of negotiations. Amazon has responded with tactics that include refusing some presale orders on Hachette books, delaying the delivery of books and suggesting that readers try other authors instead. The moves have enraged Hachette authors, including the late-night host Stephen Colbert, who ranted against Amazon this month on his show.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon has stood firm.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer’s power in the book industry — it controls roughly one-third of the country’s book business, and possibly more — has prompted publishers to move toward consolidation as they look to fortify their own negotiating positions by adding heft and larger inventory. Last year, Random House and Penguin merged into a giant publishing house, making it harder for Amazon not to carry their books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A merger of Perseus with Hachette, the fourth-largest publisher in the United States market, would result in a much smaller company than Penguin Random House. But it would offer a quick way for Hachette to strengthen its nonfiction offerings. (Hachette has been stronger in popular fiction — for example, it recently released ‘‘The Silkworm’’ by J. K. Rowling, writing as Robert Galbraith.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette has been looking to expand for a long time, and Perseus, a private company founded in 1996, was a logical target. The company has been growing quickly and had nearly $100 million in publishing sales revenue in the last year to reach record profits, according to David Steinberger, its chief executive. Mr. Steinberger will leave the company after the transaction is complete.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moreover, the distribution division — which provides back-end services like marketing to smaller independent publishers like Harvard Business Review Press — would seem to be an important factor in the success of Perseus’s nonfiction titles. But that part of the business is going to Ingram.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">The deal will close, subject to regulatory approval, at the end of July.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">German book publishers have filed a complaint with the country’s antitrust authority against Amazon, accusing the online retailer of violating competition laws, abusing its ‘‘market dominant’’ position and asking the government to investigate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The 22-page formal complaint, filed last week but announced on Tuesday, comes nearly two months after Amazon began delaying shipments of titles from Bonnier, a leading publishing group in Germany, amid a dispute over dividing revenue from e-book sales. Amazon is engaged in a similar struggle with Hachette in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Amazon’s business conduct not only affects those publishers involved, but poses a danger to all who offer e-books in Germany,’’ read the complaint by the German Publishers and Booksellers Association. The group submitted its complaint to the Bundeskartellamt, the federal antitrust authority, on Friday. ‘‘We call on the Bundeskartellamt to open an investigation and halt Amazon’s actions,’’ the complaint said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon did not respond on Tuesday to repeated requests for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Germany, the birthplace of modern printing technology, has a proud tradition of book publishing. Special laws intended to keep competition among booksellers to a minimum create an environment that makes it easier for lesser known authors to be published.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the cozy world of German publishing has been slow to adapt to the Internet age, whether in online sales or digital publishing. That has left a vacuum Amazon has swiftly moved to fill. The American company, according to industry estimates, controls as much as 70 percent of the German market for online sales of printed and electronic books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Germany is Amazon’s largest market outside the United States, posting earnings of 1.9 billion euros, or $2.6 billion, last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the retailer were to be found guilty of violating German competition law, it could be fined or ordered to change its behavior.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Bundeskartellamt on Tuesday confirmed receipt of the complaint. After reviewing it, the government will decide whether there are sufficient grounds to find that Amazon held a market-dominant position and so can be investigated for potential antitrust violations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That process could take several weeks and hinges on whether the online market can be viewed as being independent from traditional brick-and-mortar bookshops.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘For the publishers,’’ the complaint said, ‘‘it is indispensable to be listed on Amazon, as the largest selling platform for books on the Internet in Germany.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Further, the association argues, because many people use Amazon as a modern card catalog to explore which books are available, if an author is not listed, a reader would assume that the writer has not published any books. ‘‘Whoever is not listed on Amazon doesn’t exist in the eyes of a reader,’’ the association said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In early May, authors published by Bonnier, one of Germany’s largest media groups, noticed that Amazon was delaying shipments of their books, just as reports emerged that the online retailer was taking similar action against Hachette in the United States. Bonnier later confirmed that it was in negotiations with Amazon about how to share the earnings of its electronic books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some titles from Bonnier publishers are still listed on Amazon as not being available to ship for as long as 11 days, instead of the next-day deliveries that are standard for all books ordered through any bookseller in Germany.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The publishers contend that Amazon’s action should be considered ‘‘extortion,’’ and an abuse of the company’s dominant position in the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adam Fletcher, a British author living in Berlin, said in an interview that he experienced first-hand the effects of being caught in the Amazon dispute.

He showed Charlie Rose, the show’s host, a tiny helicopter dropping Amazon packages on people’s doorsteps. The company planned to name its new delivery service “Prime Air.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the F.A.A. clearly wants people delivering packages the old fashioned way: by truck.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the F.A.A. memo, titled “Interpretation of the Special Rule for Model Aircraft,” the agency said that since 2007, the commercial use of drones has been illegal in the United States and would remain so until further notice.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Until now, flying drones for fun is still considered legal, as long as they are kept below 400 feet and in no way used for commercial services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But what about Amazon’s “free” delivery. Couldn’t the company just say these drones aren’t being used for business? Not so fast, the F.A.A. said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Any operation not conducted strictly for hobby or recreation purposes could not be operated under the special rule for model aircraft. Clearly, commercial operations would not be hobby or recreation flights,” the agency said in the memo. “Likewise, flights that are in furtherance of a business, or incidental to a person’s business, would not be a hobby or recreation flight.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/smile-a-drone-is-about-to-take-your-picture-2" class="a" target="_blank">In my </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">column this week</span>, “Smile! A Drone Is About to Take Your Picture,” I noted that drones are finally starting to enter the real world — and being used for selfies — but in the process, people are getting hurt by these autonomous flying vehicles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ryan Calo, an assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Law who specializes in robotics and drones, told me that the worry about drones colliding in the air, or people being hit by them, will start to ease as drones become smarter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The next generation of drones, which are truly autonomous and can navigate using sensors and code, rather than people controlling them, will be much safer than the drones we’re seeing today,” Mr. Calo said in a phone interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As Mr. Calo and others have pointed out, it is unlikely that drones will be permanently banned for commercial services in the United States.

Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, made it very clear that one of the primary purposes of the device was to help you buy more stuff.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When asked about the connection between the phone and buying from Amazon, Mr. Bezos replied, “We make those actions very simple. As we should. Guess what: One of the things people want to do with their phones is buy stuff, from Amazon and in general.

When Mr. Bezos says that people want help with their shopping tasks, he probably isn’t talking about picking up some eggs and fruit for breakfast, even if Amazon is conducting </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">limited grocery tests</span>. A better translation for his answer would be, “We want to help people spend more money on unnecessary plastic items in the hope that it will help us increase Amazon’s profits.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This blatant attempt to get American consumers to spend more is not new. But for some reason this one has me a bit upset. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with companies trying to sell more stuff. What bothers me is that we buy into the idea.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/06/19/technology/amazon-introduces-fire-smartphone.html" class="s1" target="_blank">The Times’s David Streitfeld described the Fire phone</a> <span style=" color: #000;">as offering “Amazon fans the chance to live in an Amazon-themed world, where just about every element can be identified, listed, ranked, shared and, of course,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ordered.” Note he uses the word “fans” instead of “customers.” If we’re fans, then we’re just supporting something we love when we spend more money, right?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rebecca Lieb, an Altimeter Group analyst, said in the same article that you can use the phone to “scan a product or listen to music, and you’re delivered straight to the page on Amazon on which you can purchase it. Impulse shopping just went to a new level.” Even Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of AT&amp;T Mobility (the phone’s exclusive carrier), raved that he planned to “buy a whole lot more … with this technology.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But wait.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/business/08consume.html?pagewanted=all" class="a" target="_blank">I thought that after the Great Recession, we learned our lesson and were trying to buy less.

And that’s on us, not Amazon. We’re making the choice to pick up the phone, and we’re signing on to the idea that we want it to be very easy to buy even more stuff.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Almost all of the stuff I buy on my smartphone is a spontaneous purchase, not a carefully weighed decision. Do we really need more of those purchases in our lives? Yes, the Fire phone makes it that much easier to hit the “buy” button, but is that a good thing? It’s certainly not a path to greater happiness, even if it comes with free, two-day shipping. (Each phone includes a one-year Prime membership.)</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To be clear, the issue isn’t whether companies like Amazon should find ways to profit from our behavior. The issue is whether we should be willing to go along with it, and even pay for the privilege of doing so, particularly when we look at other factors that we know affect our happiness.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/06/credit-card-use-surges-in-april/" class="a" target="_blank">For instance, after ticking down steadily for several years during the recession, credit card debt resumed its upward trend in 2014. In April alone, </a><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/06/credit-card-use-surges-in-april/" class="s1" target="_blank">the balances on Americans’ credit cards increased</a> <span style=" color: #000;">“at the fastest pace in almost 13 years.” News items about this surge all praised “rising consumer confidence,” but at the same time there are plenty of people nearing retirement who don’t have enough money to stop working.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The last time I checked, we weren’t particularly happy when we’re in greater debt and don’t have enough money to retire. But that’s the outcome we face when we don’t bother to pull back and ask the bigger question about things like the Fire phone, including, “Does this device actually make my life better?” and “Could it make my life worse?”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unfortunately, there isn’t yet a device that makes it easy to say, “I’m better off NOT buying something.” At the moment, all we have to rely on is who we see in the mirror, and maybe a better-behaved partner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So it’s on us to push back against the things that encourage us to buy more instead of saving more. It’s on us to opt out of things that make it so tempting to do things in the short term (credit card debt) that can cost us in the long term (retirement).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are more than a dollar sign to some company and it’s time we started acting like it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Carl Richards is a financial planner in Park City, Utah, and is the director of investor education at the BAM Alliance.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Robert Sindelar, the bearded, redheaded managing partner at the Seattle independent bookseller Third Place Books -- definitely a David to Amazon&#39;s Goliath -- got the idea to take on Amazon while attending BookExpo America in New York a few weeks ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;As you can imagine, all anyone was talking about was the standoff between Hachette and Amazon,&#39;&#39; he told me this week, referring to the much-publicized impasse in contentious negotiations between the publisher and the giant Internet bookseller. &#39;&#39;I wanted to do something positive that would take advantage of this.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times revealed last month that Amazon seemed to be discouraging sales of Hachette books by failing to stock them, delaying delivery and removing pre-order buttons from its website.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exactly what the dispute involves has been shrouded in secrecy, but price is clearly at the center. Hachette and Amazon seem to be locked in the kind of intense negotiations that are common between manufacturers and retailers in most businesses, but have attracted enormous attention because of the visibility and cultural significance of books. (Negotiations between television program suppliers and cable companies have achieved similar notoriety and have also resulted in impasses.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I spoke to someone involved on the Hachette side of the negotiations, who is under orders not to discuss them and asked not to be named. This person said that Amazon has been demanding payments for a range of services, including the pre-order button, personalized recommendations and a dedicated employee at Amazon for Hachette books. This is similar to so-called co-op arrangements with traditional retailers, like paying Barnes &amp; Noble for placing a book in the front of the store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon &#39;&#39;is very inventive about what we&#39;d call standard service,&#39;&#39; this person said. &#39;&#39;They&#39;re teasing out all these layers and saying, &#39;If you want that service, you&#39;ll have to pay for it.&#39; In the end, it&#39;s very hard to know what you&#39;d be paying. Hachette has refused, and so bit by bit, they&#39;ve been taking away these services, like the pre-order button, to teach Hachette a lesson.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What bothered Mr. Sindelar wasn&#39;t that Amazon&#39;s tactics were so hard-boiled. Rather, &#39;&#39;our goal as retailers is to connect people to books,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The notion that a retailer would obstruct readers from getting to certain books they want completely violates our ethics as retailers. I wondered how we could get that message across to customers.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So Mr. Sindelar went to Hachette&#39;s publishing list, looking for the next potential blockbuster. At the Hachette subsidiary Little, Brown and Company, he found &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; by Robert Galbraith -- a.k.a. J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series -- the follow-up to her best-seller &#39;&#39;The Cuckoo&#39;s Calling.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;That seemed obvious,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Ordinarily, we wouldn&#39;t get any pre-orders for a book like that. Zero. But Amazon had deleted its pre-order button, so I thought we could capitalize on that.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Third Place Books began featuring &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; prominently on the home page of its website, offering hardcover copies at a 20 percent discount along with free, in-person delivery the day the book was released, which was Thursday. Mr. Sindelar, along with several other store employees, delivered the books (although a surprising number of customers said not to bother -- they wanted to come into the store for their copy). He also handed out what he called &#39;&#39;Hachette swag bags&#39;&#39; with a T-shirt and advance copy of a coming Hachette novel.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some buyers also received a surprise visit from a local author, Maria Semple, who wrote the best-selling book &#39;&#39;Where&#39;d You Go, Bernadette.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I thought this would show what we as booksellers stand for,&#39;&#39; Mr. Sindelar said. &#39;&#39;While Amazon is blocking people, we literally put the book in their hands. But we&#39;re not asking people to boycott Amazon. We&#39;re in Seattle and Amazon is a big part of the local economy. We&#39;re sensitive to that.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So Third Place Books didn&#39;t participate in the campaign to place &#39;&#39;I didn&#39;t buy it on Amazon&#39;&#39; stickers on books that the comedian Stephen Colbert started this month on his show on Comedy Central. (Hachette is Mr. Colbert&#39;s publisher, and the sticker campaign is backed by the American Booksellers Association.) &#39;&#39;We decided not to get down in the mud with everybody else,&#39;&#39; Mr. Sindelar said. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m tired of defining ourselves in terms of being different from Amazon. I thought this was a healthy, positive way to show how we operate and what we value.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Sindelar&#39;s efforts to gain at the expense of a major rival like Amazon could also be described in another healthy, positive way: competition. Amazon&#39;s decision to take a hard line with Hachette seems to have provided a sudden competitive advantage for other booksellers, large and small.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Walmart.com on Thursday, &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; was one of three books featured on the books&#39; home page at 40 percent off, or $16.80. Walmart has also promoted the book with ads on Facebook and through mass emails to its customers promoting Hachette books. On Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s site, &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; was one of four of &#39;&#39;the week&#39;s biggest books.&#39;&#39; A digital edition for the Nook was $11.99. It was Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s No. 2 best-seller on Thursday. On Bookish, the website that the major publishers started last year to combat Amazon, it was the first &#39;&#39;new and notable&#39;&#39; release featured, and was selling for $19.60.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon showed no sign of backing down. On Thursday, it was selling &#39;&#39;The Silkworm&#39;&#39; in hardback for $25.20 -- nearly the full suggested retail price -- along with the message that delivery could take &#39;&#39;2 to 4 weeks.&#39;&#39; On Thursday afternoon, the book&#39;s best-seller rank was just 210. (The Kindle digital edition was $9.99.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From Mr. Sindelar&#39;s perspective, his promotion was successful. He said he sold 60 copies on the first day, when ordinarily, he said, he&#39;d be lucky to sell five.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All of this must be warming the hearts of antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which was widely criticized after it filed an antitrust case against five major publishers and Apple, accusing them of conspiring to raise e-book prices. The five publishers -- Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon &amp; Schuster (all the so-called majors except Random House) -- settled the charges with the department and agreed not to collude. Apple was found guilty after a lengthy trial. (It is appealing the decision.) A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the Amazon-Hachette dispute.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To many, especially publishers, authors and booksellers, it seemed perverse that the government sued the major publishers and Apple, whose iBookstore was a new entrant into digital publishing, and not Amazon itself, which seemed to be rapidly amassing quasi-monopoly power in book retailing. But as Judge Denise Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled, the evidence was overwhelming that the publishers&#39; and Apple&#39;s goal wasn&#39;t to promote competition, but to raise e-book prices so that Apple wouldn&#39;t lose money and so that e-book sales wouldn&#39;t undercut the far more profitable sales of hardcover books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She noted that monopoly power isn&#39;t illegal unless it&#39;s gained unlawfully, in which case the publishers and Apple should have filed a complaint with the government rather than conspiring to raise prices. &#39;&#39;Another company&#39;s alleged violation of antitrust laws is not an excuse for engaging in your own violations of law,&#39;&#39; she ruled. &#39;&#39;Antitrust laws were enacted for the &#39;protection of competition, not competitors,&#39; &#39;&#39; she continued, quoting a famous Supreme Court case.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, even Amazon seems willing to make some concessions. Two Hachette books, J. D. Salinger&#39;s &#39;&#39;The Catcher in the Rye&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;The Goldfinch,&#39;&#39; by Donna Tartt, are available on Amazon at deep discounts and for immediate delivery. Why that would be the case isn&#39;t clear, but one is a classic used in many schools and the other recently won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next big test for Hachette and Amazon will probably come next week, when the Hachette subsidiary Little, Brown will publish &#39;&#39;Invisible&#39;&#39; by the mega-best-selling author James Patterson and the novelist David Ellis. The book isn&#39;t available for pre-order on Amazon, although a free 28-page preview is available to Kindle readers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon confirmed on its website that it was not taking pre-orders for Hachette books. In its statement, it said that it was &#39;&#39;the right of a retailer to determine whether the terms on offer are acceptable and to stock items accordingly.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hachette declined to comment on negotiations with Amazon. As for &#39;&#39;The Silkworm,&#39;&#39; a spokeswoman for Little, Brown said it was too soon to have any sales numbers, but &#39;&#39;the early feedback we&#39;ve had from retailers is very encouraging.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And while Hachette is the lone publisher operating in the United States in the current standoff, other contracts between Amazon and major publishers will soon be expiring. The other publishers and booksellers are eager to see if they, too, hold the line. (There&#39;s nothing illegal about publishers adopting similar stances in their negotiations, as long as they don&#39;t collude.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whether even the combined efforts of the publishers and competitive efforts of rival retailers can dent Amazon&#39;s market power remains to be seen. Amazon accounts for about a third of book sales in the United States and 60 percent of Hachette&#39;s digital sales. The person involved in the Hachette negotiations wasn&#39;t optimistic for the publishers. In previous rounds with Amazon, &#39;&#39;We had so little leverage. It felt like I had a slingshot and they had a tank. We&#39;d fight and fight and then we&#39;d make concessions. They rolled over us.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This person compared Hachette&#39;s situation to that of gazelles, a reference to Brad Stone&#39;s book about Amazon, &#39;&#39;The Everything Store.&#39;&#39; In it, Mr. Stone describes what was known inside the company as &#39;&#39;The Gazelle Project,&#39;&#39; in which the chief executive, Jeffrey Bezos, compared Amazon to a cheetah hunting weak, sickly gazelles -- in that case, a metaphor for small publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Who&#39;s going to blink first?&#39;&#39; mused Mr. Sindelar, the independent bookseller. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s what everyone wants to know. I have no idea. But a lot of our customers told us they were buying from us explicitly as a protest against Amazon. We live in Seattle, where people go to farmers&#39; markets. They don&#39;t want to limit the diversity of where they shop. I think this has helped people realize that if Amazon is the only option, that&#39;s putting way too much power in one company.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Robert Sindelar, center, of Third Place Books, and the author Maria Semple delivering one of her books as well as the new release &#39;&#39;The Silkworm.&#39;&#39; (B1); Third Place Books in Seattle offered &#39;&#39;The Silkworm,&#39;&#39; which J.
