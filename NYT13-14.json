        "content": " Last spring, when Amazon began discouraging customers from buying books published by Hachette, the writers grumbled that they were pawns in the retailer\u2019s contract negotiations over e-book prices. During the summer, they banded together and publicly protested Amazon\u2019s actions. Now, hundreds of other writers, including some of the world\u2019s most distinguished, are joining the coalition. Few if any are published by Hachette. And they have goals far broader than freeing up the Hachette titles. They want the Justice Department to investigate Amazon for illegal monopoly tactics. They also want to highlight the issue being debated endlessly and furiously on writers\u2019 blogs: What are the rights and responsibilities of a company that sells half the books in the United States and controls the dominant e-book platform? Andrew Wylie, whose client roster of heavyweights in literature is probably longer than that of any other literary agent, said he was asking all his writers whether they wanted to join the group, Authors United. Among those who have said yes, Mr. Wylie said in a phone interview from Paris, are Philip Roth, Orhan Pamuk, Salman Rushdie, V.S. Naipaul and Milan Kundera. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s very clear to me, and to those I represent, that what Amazon is doing is very detrimental to the publishing industry and the interests of authors,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Wylie said. \u2018\u2018If Amazon is not stopped, we are facing the end of literary culture in America.\u2019\u2019 Amazon declined to comment for this article. But in an interview in July, Russ Grandinetti, the company\u2019s vice president for Kindle, said: \u2018\u2018Books are really home for us. That\u2019s where we started. We care deeply about them. Helping books and authors succeed in a crowded world of digital media is very important to us.\u2019\u2019 Even Amazon\u2019s detractors readily acknowledge that it is one of the most powerful tools for selling books since the Gutenberg press. But how that power is used is increasingly being questioned in a way it was not during the company\u2019s rise. Take, for instance, the different treatment Amazon has given two new Hachette books on political themes. \u2018\u2018Sons of Wichita,\u2019\u2019 by Daniel Schulman, a writer for Mother Jones magazine, came out in May. Amazon initially discounted the book, a well- received biography of the conservative Koch brothers, by 10 percent, according to a price-tracking service. Now it does not discount it at all. It takes as long as three weeks to ship. \u2018\u2018The Way Forward: Renewing the American Idea,\u2019\u2019 by Representative Paul Ryan has no such constraints, an unusual position these days for a new Hachette book. Amazon refused to take advance orders for \u2018\u2018The Way Forward,\u2019\u2019 as it does with all new Hachette titles. But once the book was on sale, it was consistently discounted by about 25 percent. There is no shipping delay. Not surprisingly, it has a much higher sales ranking on Amazon than \u2018\u2018Sons of Wichita.\u2019\u2019 An Amazon spokesman declined to explain why \u2018\u2018The Way Forward\u2019\u2019 was getting special treatment. A spokesman for Mr. Ryan, the 2012 Republican nominee for vice president, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Hachette declined to comment. A recent sign-up to Authors United who is not a Wylie client is Ursula K. Le Guin, the recipient of the 2014 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Toni Morrison, Oprah Winfrey, Ray Bradbury and Eudora Welty are among previous winners of the medal, given by the National Book Foundation during its annual awards ceremony in November. Ms. Le Guin, author of \u2018\u2018The Left Hand of Darkness,\u2019\u2019 the Earthsea series and other award-winning works, will be presented her medal by Neil Gaiman, a regular attendee at the all-expenses-paid Campfire weekend for writers, where Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, will be the host. She has strong feelings about the Amazon-Hachette dispute. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re talking about censorship: deliberately making a book hard or impossible to get, \u2018disappearing\u2019 an author,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Le Guin wrote in an email. \u2018\u2018Governments use censorship for moral and political ends, justifiable or not. Amazon is using censorship to gain total market control so they can dictate to publishers what they can publish, to authors what they can write, to readers what they can buy. This is more than unjustifiable, it is intolerable.\u2019\u2019 The Wylie Agency has about a thousand clients. Many have not yet responded to Mr. Wylie\u2019s query about Authors United, because they are traveling or are inattentive to email. But about 300 Wylie writers have signed on, as well as the estates of Saul Bellow, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Joseph Brodsky, William Burroughs, John Cheever, Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, Arthur Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. \u2018\u2018Every single response without exception has been positive,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Wylie said. Authors United, spearheaded by the thriller writer Douglas Preston, is in the midst of two efforts: writing members of the Amazon board individually in the hope that they will sway Mr. Bezos to take Hachette books out of the line of fire while negotiations continue, and drafting a letter to the Justice Department asking it to examine Amazon for possible antitrust violations. Any threat presented by these initiatives does not seem to have weakened Amazon\u2019s resolve. The retailer has said that it was trying to make e-books cheaper and thus more affordable for all, and that publishers and writers would make up in volume what they were losing in margin if the prices were lower. Confronting Hachette and its authors might incur some short-term public relations damage for Amazon. But if Wall Street feels that the suppliers have the upper hand, that could damage Amazon in a more vulnerable place: its stock market valuation. Amazon shares are underperforming the market this year, but its valuation is still sky-high. Mr. Preston, the thriller writer, sent a letter to members of Authors United on Friday saying: \u2018\u2018I had hoped our efforts would have resulted in some gesture from Amazon, which is well aware of the damage it is doing to the careers of several thousand authors. Instead, we have been met with disparagement.\u2019\u2019 The letter to the Justice Department is being written by Barry C. Lynn, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and author of \u2018\u2018Cornered: The New Monopoly Capitalism and the Economics of Destruction.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Lynn said the letter, which is being prepared with the help of several antitrust specialists, would be ready at the end of the week. Whether a viable case could be mounted against Amazon is a matter of debate among antitrust scholars. An earlier effort by Hachette to interest government regulators in a case did not go anywhere. Amazon had better luck. In 2010, it sent a letter to the Justice Department outlining a possible antitrust case against Apple and five major publishers that suggested they had colluded to raise e-book prices. How much that influenced the government is unknown, but the case became a reality. The publishers, including Hachette, denied collusion but settled the case, saying they could not afford to defend it. Apple lost in court. That acrimonious past hangs heavily over the New York publishing community. Few major editors or agents have spoken publicly about the latest dispute. \u2018\u2018Everyone is scared to death of being accused of something,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Wylie said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s impossible for two publishers to have lunch without a lawyer being present.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " All Hachette authors are equal, but some are more equal than others. Before Representative Paul Ryan\u2019s book  \u201cThe Way Forward\u201d   was published by Twelve, a Hachette imprint, it was impossible to order on Amazon. The retailer has been refusing pre-orders on just about all new Hachette books as a way of gaining leverage in its dispute with the publisher over e-book terms. It is a very effective weapon. Pre-orders show the accumulating interest in a new title and help the publisher gauge the size of the print run. If pre-orders are strong, they put the book on the bestseller list in its first week, which could give it enough momentum to stay there for a while. After \u201cThe Way Forward\u201d became officially available Aug. 19, there was another problem. It was not easy to find the book on the retailer\u2019s site. The only thing that came up was the audio book. A glitch, perhaps \u2013 although it seems to happen to other Hachette books as well. Any author is going to be a little annoyed if the country\u2019s largest bookseller appears reluctant to sell his book. So when Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on Aug. 20,  he seemed peeved at   Amazon   . \u201cAs a congressman I have to watch what I say,\u201d he said. But he went on to call the bookseller\u2019s actions \u201ca very frustrating thing\u201d and added that \u201cclearly Amazon is making kind of a power play here.\u201d Is Amazon a monopoly? \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that question,\u201d he said. He might not be a fan of regulation, but should something be done here? \u201cIf I were just a private citizen I would voice one straight opinion,\u201d he began, but noted again that he was a member of Congress. Was Amazon listening? At right about that moment, the retailer suddenly began treating Mr. Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, much better. Customers could suddenly find his book. It was fully discounted. And they could get it immediately. How Amazon prices books is a mystery. It does not explain its pricing policies, and a spokeswoman declined to comment for this post. In general, though, new books seem discounted more than older books, while the most popular books have the highest discounts. Presumably this is because Amazon wants to remain competitive on books the buyer is likely to see in Barnes & Noble or an independent shop. With the new Hachette hardcovers \u2014 paperbacks and older books seem to follow other rules \u2014 Amazon has largely reversed its usual formula. It barely discounts the books at all, and takes as long as five weeks to ship them. But a few books fare better. For instance, \u201c13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi\u201d and \u201cHow Google Works\u201d are among the top 100 sellers on Amazon. Although they are Hachette books, they ship immediately and are heavily discounted. So Amazon is selling the bestsellers and delaying everything else? But this is not what is happening either. Sandra Brown\u2019s novel  \u201cMean Streak,\u201d   which was published by another Hachette imprint, Grand Central, on the same day as \u201cThe Way Forward,\u201d is delayed for as long as two weeks, Amazon says. And Tavis Smiley\u2019s  \u201cDeath   of a King: The Real Story of Dr. Martin Luther King\u2019s Final Year,\u201d   published Sept. 9 by the Hachette imprint Little, Brown, takes as long as three weeks to ship. Despite those shipping delays \u2014 coupled with the minimal discounts \u2014 both \u201cMean Streak,\u201d with an Amazon bestseller ranking of 1,145 on Monday afternoon, and \u201cDeath of a King,\u201d at 1,419, are selling as well or better than \u201cThe Way Forward,\u201d at 1,401. Another book that did not get the Ryan treatment, as I mentioned in  an article on Monday,   was  \u201cSons of Wichita,\u201d   about the conservative billionaire Koch brothers. The book got strong early reviews, and reached the extended New York Times bestseller list. But Amazon barely discounted it and warned shipping would  take as long as five   weeks   . (On Aug. 1,  the discount was dropped entirely   .) The book promptly fell off the list. \u201cThe wind was at my back, but Amazon diminished some of that momentum at a key moment,\u201d said Daniel Schulman, its author. Some authors might be bitter at this, and forswear Amazon forever. But as he awaits the birth of his first child, Mr. Schulman personally remains a devoted Amazon customer. \u201cDo I like it when I press Buy?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt does bother me. It\u2019s a split brain thing. My wife would probably divorce me if I got rid of our Amazon Prime subscription.\u201d Mr. Schulman\u2019s conclusion: \u201cIf you\u2019re a powerful business mogul or politician, Amazon might not mess with your book sales.\u201d Too bad, he joked, that he is not on the 2016 presidential short list.",

        "content": " \u201cTransparent,\u201d a new, 10-episode series from Amazon Studios, has made quite a splash.  The storyline   follows the Pfeffermans, a family of fast-talking Angelenos led by Mort, a divorc\u00e9 and recovering womanizer who, in the pilot episode, tries and fails to come out as transgender to his three children. \u201cIt\u2019s a daring, difficult project,\u201d  says   The New Yorker\u2019s Emily Nussbaum, \u201cA chewy story.\u201d Jeffrey Tambor, in transition from Mort to \u201cMaura,\u201d is \u201ca fragile, melancholy figure,\u201d Ms. Nussbaum writes, \u201chis glower softened by peach face powder; coming out in his seventies is presented as something that\u2019s as much an ending as a beginning.\u201d It\u2019s a show that\u2019s turning a lot of heads \u2014 for more reasons than quality of writing or casting, both of which are apparent. The show breaks new ground in its portrayal of a central transgender character. \u201cIf Laverne Cox\u2019s character in \u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 was the first promising step towards a better depiction of trans-people on television, then this is the second,\u201d  writes   Ellen E. Jones for The Independent. \u201cTransparent\u201d is \u201ca show that not only features a fully rounded transgendered woman in a central role but also explores through its ensemble cast the fluidity of gender in general.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s like four shows coming out with trans content this year,\u201d  said   the show\u2019s creator, Jill Soloway, in an interview with Ali Liebegott, a writer for the show, published by The Atlantic. But Ms. Liebegott wonders if a cisgender male actor (Mr. Tambor) can \u201cbe enough of a first stepping stone for transwomen who\u2019ve waited forever for any kind of representation? Could a transphobe somewhere see this show and feel something shift? With four new shows with trans content, will cisgender people pepper their scripts with trans characters to sell scripts? The thought of that makes me want to crawl back in bed.\u201d It\u2019s a concern Mr. Tambor shares. In his research for the role, he spent an evening out at Oxwood Inn, a transgender nightclub in Los Angeles. \u201cFirst they came to the hotel and we talked and did the metamorphosis with the wig and the makeup,\u201d he recalls in  an interview with Hadley Freeman at The Guardian . \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so scared in my life as I was when I walked through the hotel as a woman. It was an epiphany, because I realized, this is how Maura feels every day in her life.\u201d \u201cTambor was born in San Francisco,\u201d Ms. Freedman reports, \u201craised conservative Jewish but grew up in what he describes as \u2018a liberal environment.\u2019\u201d Nevertheless, he told her he was ignorant about transgender people \u201cwith a capital IG.\u201d \u201cSo I went in with my eyes wide open,\u201d he said. What makes \u201cTransparent\u201d doubly special , in the eyes of Brian Lowry at Variety, is that it \u201ctakes an idea that feels pretty well played out\u201d \u2014 family comedy-drama in the vein of \u201cParenthood\u201d or \u201cBrothers and Sisters\u201d \u2014 yet \u201cinvigorates it not through a gimmick but rather via strong writing and performances.\u201d And while Amazon has previously released a few well-received web series ( \u201cAlpha House\u201d   and  \u201cBetas\u201d ), \u201cTransparent\u201d confirms a growing consensus in Hollywood: that \u201cAmazon has the goods to become a serious player in the premium programming game.\u201d \u201cTransparent\u201d is \u201camong five new original series Amazon is rolling out in the coming months,\u201d  reports   Zoe Mintz for International Business Times. \u201cThe original shows are a long way from Amazon Prime Video\u2019s beginnings in 2011 where the service had about 5,000 titles in its library compared with more than 40,000 today. The subscription service is tied to Amazon Prime, a $99 annual membership that allows consumers to receive free two-day shipping on certain products and unlimited access to its TV and movie library.\u201d Amazon\u2019s development executives are clearly gunning for Netflix, which currently leads the market in high-end web series production. Shows like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d in addition to a successful reboot of \u201cArrested Development\u201d (also starring Mr. Tambor), made the company over $1 billion last quarter and earned it 31 Emmy nominations. Though, \u201cwhile Netflix still remains the big name in the streaming business, data shows that users are open to other brands,\u201d Ms. Mintz writes. It looks as if \u201cTransparent\u201d may open the lanes up to Amazon. It\u2019s a \u201cgorgeous, nuanced story,\u201d  writesJames   Poniewozik at Time , \u201cand a sign of a TV business in transformation.\u201d As Lisa Gerstner  notes   at Kiplinger, programming delivered via Internet streaming services, such as Amazon Prime, Netflix or Hulu, poses a more affordable alternative to cable \u2014 the HBO and Showtime-helmed bastion of high-quality television for the past decade or so. With \u201cTransparent,\u201d it seems we are witnessing an evolution of both content and medium, toward more progressive themes and more accessible platforms \u2014 all in all, more inclusive TV.",

        "name": "Seattle Start-Up Factory Hires Former Amazon and Microsoft Executive ",
        "content": " SEATTLE \u2013  Ivy Softworks   is a new start-up factory that has devised what its founder says is a better way to create tech companies. Now the plan has attracted Brian Valentine, a prominent engineer and executive who worked for years at Microsoft and Amazon. Mr. Valentine recently joined Ivy as a managing principal, where he intends to help form the teams that will turn the firm\u2019s ideas into products and companies. Ivy Softworks is the brainchild of Jordan Ritter, a serial entrepreneur who co-founded Napster, the once-popular music service that ran into legal trouble. Start-up incubators are not a new concept, of course. Traditional venture capital firms often employ \u201centrepreneurs in residence\u201d to create fledgling companies. Mr. Ritter and Mr. Valentine said their singular priority was to hire entrepreneurial engineers, even if they do not come to Ivy with well-formulated start-up ideas. \u201cWe tend to think about people first,\u201d Mr. Valentine said in a recent interview in Ivy\u2019s offices in a brick-walled loft in this city\u2019s Pioneer Square neighborhood, \u201cIncubators tend to think about products first.\u201d Mr. Ritter\u2019s catchphrase for Ivy is \u201cinnovation studio.\u201d It was born last year from seeing his initial start-up teams disintegrate and scatter to the winds as the companies matured. The older his start-ups became, the more they naturally began to focus on executing on sales and development plans rather than innovating, which was less satisfying to the founding teams, Mr. Ritter said. Mr. Ritter said he found the separation particularly painful because he had moved a lot as a child and does not have much family. \u201cWhen I built companies, I was building my families,\u201d he said. Ivy is attempting to solve the problem by giving its employees the ability to work on early stage projects then shift to new, unrelated projects as their previous efforts ripen into start-ups. The employees receive equity in any projects they work on, as they would in traditional start-up environments. Ivy is working on several projects that Mr. Ritter wouldn\u2019t discuss, except to say that they are in the area of \u201cproductivity and collaboration tools.\u201d Mr. Ritter said Ivy was well-funded by prominent Seattle-area investors, including individuals and institutions, though he declined to name them. The investors wanted Ivy to be near them in Seattle. Mr. Ritter said. He said he also prefers Seattle to the more crowded, aggressive start-up culture of San Francisco, where he was previously based. \u201cI feel a city in its ascendancy,\u201d he said of Seattle. When Mr. Valentine left Amazon in early 2014, he intended to retire and travel the world. Amazon\u2019s chief executive recruited Mr. Valentine to the company in 2006, where he led the development of its e-commerce platform. For 19 years before that, Mr. Valentine was one of the top engineering leaders at Microsoft, helping to introduce its blockbuster Exchange messaging product and leading Windows development for years. Mr. Valentine said he changed his retirement plans after hearing Mr. Ritter\u2019s pitch for Ivy.",

        "name": "On the Trail of an Online Pirate ",
        "content": " Last Sunday  Jenna Wortham , a technology reporter,  profiled Hana Beshara , a founder of NinjaVideo, a now-shuttered streaming website. She discusses the challenge of tracking down Ms. Beshara, who served a prison term for her role in running the illegal site, and of describing a culture with a different understanding of copyright law. I can\u2019t quite remember first time I saw NinjaVideo \u2014 maybe late 2008 or early 2009, not long after it launched \u2014 but I definitely remember my reaction: I was in total awe. The site was so flagrantly illegal, it felt almost anarchist and borderline punk rock \u2014 there was just such a total disregard for copyright law that I remember thinking, \u201cHow is this site still up?\u201d Of course, that question was answered in 2010 when the federal government shut it down. But while it lived, it was a marvel of technology because it just worked. While it was live, Damon Darlin, my editor at the time, encouraged me to find out who was behind it, but the idea got lost in the shuffle of daily responsibilities and assignments. Then the site and its founders got raided, and the tech press jumped all over the story. I kicked myself for not looking into it sooner, and obsessively followed all the news about the case and proceedings as they progressed. Other journalists, including Natasha Tiku at The Observer, Ernesto at TorrentFreak \u2014 a blog that follows news about piracy \u2014 and The American Prospect took up the story, but I felt like there would still be room to revisit it a few years later to gauge whether the government\u2019s decision \u2014 to lock up a bunch of 20-something kids for running an illegal streaming site \u2014 had effectively achieved its goal of snuffing out illegal downloading online. I first reached out to Ms. Beshara, one of the figures behind the site, in June 2013. She had recently been released from prison and I emailed Ernesto, of TorrentFreak, to see if he could put me in touch. A few days later, I heard from Candee, one of the site\u2019s former moderators, and she said Ms. Beshara wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to me until she had completed the home detention portion of her sentence. I waited a few months, and finally, in October, Ms. Beshara emailed me. It took another few months to actually talk \u2014 we Skyped while she worked in a coffee shop co-op as part of her court-ordered community service \u2014 and I was struck by how familiar she seemed; how much she could have been someone I knew or interacted with. I only wish I had also been able to interview the technical administrators behind the site, but I was not able to connect with them before the piece ran. Writing about something as controversial as online piracy, particularly at a moment when the company I work for is navigating the transition to a subscription-based business model, is a challenge unto itself. It\u2019s an area that many people passionate about \u2014 as evidenced by all the comments we received on the story. I tried to get readers \u2014 particularly older readers and those who work in the entertainment business \u2014 to understand a perspective that is so unlike their own and instead see it as a reflection of the world we now live in. I wanted them to question whether the laws are nuanced and complex enough to address the changes they govern. I\u2019m not sure I was entirely successful! I am familiar with the world Ms. Beshara and her cohorts inhabited. I came of age before Netflix/Hulu/iTunes were in full effect and when illegal streaming networks like Napster, Demonoid and Kazaa were proto-social networks. Talking about the music you were downloading was an icebreaker; it was part of the social fabric in high school and college. Even after those services got shut down, I noticed that the habits remained. Friends of mine share their Amazon, Netflix and HBO login information freely and loan each other their Kindles so they can read the books on them. It\u2019s endlessly fascinating to observe how our views about sharing, digital property and ownership evolve, and the relationship between consumers and the law and copyright owners is endlessly fascinating. I now pay for nearly all the content I consume, but I never lost interest in that world and the people who operate in it.",

        "content": " THERE are no signs that Martin Sorrell, chief executive of  WPP , the world\u2019s largest agency holding group, plans to change careers. But if he were to do so, he might make a decent living on the conference circuit as a moderator. Mr. Sorrell\u2019s skills in leading a panel were on display on Monday as he moderated an opening session of Advertising Week in New York. He deftly elicited quotable remarks from his four panelists, senior executives from Amazon, CBS Interactive, ESPN and Live Nation; asked some penetrating questions; and liberally peppered the proceedings with humor, as when he mocked a lofty introduction of the panel: \u201cGood to know we\u2019re the \u2018great minds.\u2019 Good to know we\u2019re so inspirational.\u201d Mr. Sorrell\u2019s stint on stage, which helped start the 11th annual  Advertising Week , followed well-received turns moderating three events in the last year and a half, one at  Advertising Week New York   and the others at Advertising Week Europe. This time, the title of the discussion, \u201cWinning,\u201d was meant to suggest that success on Madison Avenue could be just as rewarding \u2014 and elusive \u2014 as success on a field, pitch or gridiron. During a discussion of branded content, also known as content marketing or  sponsored content , Mr. Sorrell asked the panelists whether brands ought to create their own content or sponsor content created by media companies. Lisa Utzschneider, global vice president for advertising sales at Amazon, replied, \u201cIt should be a combination of both,\u201d citing a program for a marketer, Nissan, that does not sell products on Amazon.com but advertises on the site to help send car shoppers to dealers. Mr. Sorrell tweaked Ms. Utzschneider about her employer\u2019s might and about its secretive ways. When he declared, echoing  recent news reports , that Amazon was the largest buyer of search ads on Google, she replied, \u201cThat\u2019s your data.\u201d And when he asked about other reports that Amazon was planning to develop its own software for placing ads online, competing against a Google product called  Google AdWords , Ms. Utzschneider said, \u201cI can\u2019t comment on that.\u201d Mr. Sorrell said, \u201cI\u2019m not doing it to be mischievous,\u201d and rephrased the question. After receiving a general type of reply from Ms. Utzschneider, he said cheerfully, \u201cI think I should give up.\u201d Branded content was the focus of another session on Monday, featuring executives from two food chains,  Dunkin\u2019   Donuts   and  Chili\u2019s , and from their creative agency,  Hill Holliday . Krista Gibson, chief marketing officer of Chili\u2019s, described how her company had agreed to be integrated into a competition series,  \u201cOn the Menu,\u201d   that is to make its debut on Friday on the cable channel TNT. In the first episode , three home cooks vie to create a new Craft Burger hamburger dish for Chili\u2019s; the winner\u2019s recipe will be added Saturday to the menus of Chili\u2019s restaurants around the country. (Each of the 10 episodes will be centered on a different restaurant chain or food-service firm.) \u201cOur biggest fear,\u201d Ms. Gibson revealed, was that \u201cwe\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d but she said that the feeling had been tempered by the naming of \u201ctwo people from the company\u201d as judges along with the chef Emeril Lagasse, billed as the show\u2019s \u201cmenu master,\u201d and the host, Ty Pennington. Mr. Pennington, who joined the executives on the panel, said that making the winning dish available nationally the following day meant that \u201cthe viewer can finally get really involved\u201d in a competition series. Restaurants like Chili\u2019s, he added, were \u201cwhere America, Middle America, is having dinner.\u201d Mr. Pennington is on a lengthy list of celebrities scheduled to appear during this  Advertising Week , or #AWXI in the parlance of  social media . Some stars are even doing double duty. For instance, Katie Couric, now the global news anchor of Yahoo, took part Monday morning in a conversation with Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, during the opening general session of the MIXX Conference 2014, organized by the Interactive Advertising Bureau. (The bureau holds the conference each year during the first two days of Advertising Week.) Then Ms. Couric accompanied Ms. Sandberg to Ms. Sandberg\u2019s next Advertising Week gig, taking a seat in the audience as Ms. Sandberg moderated a panel called \u201cRethinking Marketing to Women.\u201d After Ms. Sandberg, whose  LeanIn.org   sponsored the panel with  Getty Images , showed the audience several commercials that she praised for shattering stereotypes, Ms. Couric asked why so many advertisements still \u201chypersexualize\u201d women, citing as an example \u201ccreepy\u201d signs in Times Square, which she said she and her husband had seen recently, that displayed \u201chuge images of girls in underwear\u201d with \u201chumungo\u201d rear ends. And some commercials on screens inside taxi cabs \u201cresemble soft porn,\u201d she complained, which was \u201cwhy I end up turning off taxi TV most of the time.\u201d Advertising Week is to continue through Thursday.

        "name": "A Closer Look at the Ways of Amazon ",
        "content": " John Rossman, an executive at Amazon in the early 2000s, has written ''The Amazon Way,'' about the 14 leadership principles that drive the retailer, including obsessing over the customer, hiring and developing the best, and practicing frugality. The relatively brief book, which was published through Amazon's self-publishing platform, discusses how these rules can benefit any company -- should it be brave enough to put them into effect. ''None of the 14 principles mentions the need for a healthy work-life balance,'' the author notes. Mr. Rossman, now a managing director at Alvarez & Marsal, a consulting firm in New York, recounts a meeting with Jeff Bezos when the Amazon founder gazed toward Microsoft's campus and said, ''I don't want this place to become a country club.'' Mr. Bezos added that if Amazon became like Microsoft, ''we would die.'' Twenty years after it was founded, Amazon seems at little risk of becoming complacent. But Mr. Rossman is alert to the flip side of the issue: How do you become the biggest company in the world -- something that is clearly Amazon's goal, whether it be measured in revenue or market capitalization -- without being so aggressive that it creates regulatory or public relations problems? Following are excerpts from two conversations with Mr. Rossman. They have been edited for clarity. Q. What is your take on Amazon's long-running effort to get Hachette, the fourth-biggest publisher, to lower its e-book margins? Why is winning this battle so very important for Amazon? A. The deal that Amazon gets from Hachette will set a benchmark for other deals with publishers. When you're in a scenario like this, you're really careful with the first deal because it will implicate all the additional partners and vendors you're going to negotiate with. Also, look at the incredible capital investment spree that Amazon is on. It's under a lot of pressure to create more margin in areas that are already at maturity. They are looking for every dollar they can to feed into their other businesses. And then they have their long-term goal of taking out the middleman, allowing the content producers to put their work directly into the customer's hands. Q. Amazon has issued several statements, but in general is trying to remain quiet about this dispute. A. There has been a long history of topics and investments and initiatives that Amazon has been comfortable either not explaining or taking some negative press on. One of Jeff's great quotes is, ''You have to be willing to be misunderstood for a long period of time.'' Q. What are the potential pitfalls in Amazon's Hachette strategy? A. Sometimes in these negotiations, you have to be careful in squeezing so much out of your vendor that they don't have a viable business. Q. In general, Amazon has a reputation of being very tough with competitors as well as suppliers. A. Amazon has a willingness to aggressively compete on margin. It is able to have a race to the bottom that most other companies don't want to have. Q. That's one of the ways in which this is a company unlike any other. A. They operate without the kind of constraints that hold down so many other companies. The mandate of the organization, to explore and invent, gives them a good shot at coming up with new things. The business that Amazon is in today, the things they do to delight their customers, will change. In 10 years, they will be in new businesses. Q. You mention that the philosophy is that every new hire in Amazon should say in five years that ''I'm glad I got hired when I did, because I wouldn't get hired now.'' And that the kiss of death there is being known as a ''solid guy.'' A. There are tension and demands that go far beyond other employers. Amazon believes in internal competition. It's very Darwinian. They believe in small teams versus bureaucratic control. But if you want to build things and launch products, you can. If you want to have a simple job, one where you don't look for improvements, it's going to torture you. Q. The message of your book is that other companies can learn from Amazon -- they can be faster, smarter, more aggressive. But can Amazon be too Amazon? What are the risks in following these principles? A. They have always seen themselves as a scrappy start-up, where you have to eke out every percent of margin and there is a lose-win proposition in every negotiation. They are going to have to adjust their M.O. and get savvier from a P.R. standpoint. All of this is within their reach but it's not going to be easy. Q. Competitors and other foes are waiting for it to stumble. What could prompt a significant setback? A. Customer trust is at the center of everything they do, so if there were a major data breach that would be worrisome. Then there is the issue of keeping employees hungry and avoiding bureaucracy. Amazon employees are paid relatively little. All the upside is in the stock. If the stock is flat to negative for a long period of time, that is going to make it a challenge to retain top talent. Amazon is also getting to a size where it is starting to see the attention of unions and regulators. Q. Another way Amazon is different is that they actually encourage people to quit. A. Some companies say, ''We need to decrease employee turnover'' but Amazon is very comfortable with it. They don't want you to settle in, to slow down. Bringing in new employees that have to create new value in order to get compensated is what regenerates the company. Q. Sooner or later, even the fastest-growing company tops out. A. The concern I would have for Amazon is that revenue growth has dropped from close to 50 percent annually to less than half that. I think in the short term they are looking at how to accelerate the growth percentages in their core retail business.",

        "name": "An App Keeps Discussions Alive ",
        "content": " If you want to really change the world, Ray Ozzie has concluded, change the conversation. In this case, change it into a medium in which wireless speech becomes a durable, searchable part of the computer world. Mr. Ozzie, a well-regarded software engineer who in 2010 resigned as Microsoft's chief software architect, on Tuesday announced a company and product called Talko. An app on the iPhone (and eventually Android phones and desktop computers), Talko enables one-on-one and group calls that can be recorded, tagged, amended and augmented with photos, all while the call is going on. Later, parts of it can be searched for important elements, such as when a project is due. ''I can't predict how this thing will turn out, but by making voice as easy to use as text it will change things,'' Mr. Ozzie said in an interview. ''If the Internet had been invented first, every voice call would be viewed by a different standard.'' That is to say, conversations would be marked and made durable, something that has been long been sought by adherents of something called ''hypervoice.'' Talko does this by some clever software inside the cloud computing systems of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, a global computing system that Mr. Ozzie helped create while at Microsoft. It does so with an elegant design that allows users to turn down calls or text seeking permissions, or leave one another short voice messages that are more like audio texts than voice mail. During a call, Talko shows images of all participants. The talker takes the center image on the phone's screen, while others hover above. A running line across the bottom of the screen shows the call is being recorded, and also serves as a marker for insertions to the call like hashtags or photos. It is possible to take a picture during a call and post it so viewers can see the same thing. After the call, Talko creates a log that can show when it took place, who was in it, and what images and subjects were covered. All of this can be searched later, and is at the heart of Talko's eventual business model. ''In business, having old calls is critical,'' said Mr. Ozzie, who founded Talko with Matt Pope and Eric Patey. While Talko is free to download and use, ''we keep a 10-day rolling window of calls for businesses, and if they want to retain them longer we will charge.'' He said he expected that service to cost $5 to $9 per user a month. As an initial product, Talko is impressive, but even Mr. Ozzie seems interested in what the implications might be of making voice into a durable object. While there has been some concern about the implications of such a move, it seems likely to happen. Perhaps it is particularly useful, then, that Mr. Ozzie has baked some privacy protection into Talko: Any participant in the call, he says, has the right to delete all or part of the conversation. ''We wanted to make sure people know it's in their hands,'' Mr. Ozzie said. Of course, companies may not be bound by Talko's protections, and could write around these policies; or another provider might come along with a similar service that does not have the delete protection. Early reviews, from a very small test group, were positive, however. ''You don't need to take notes during conference calls, or worry about things you'll need to remember to do later,'' said Kelly Fitzsimmons, co-founder of the Hypervoice Consortium, which researches the future of communications and has used Talko. ''It frees people from the work of paying attention to other things in a conversation.'' In addition, she added: ''Ray is providing an answer to the problem of self-reinvention in a world where everything is stored: You can delete yourself.''",

        "content": " This series, which Amazon began streaming on Friday, is about a transgender woman. And that sounds suspiciously as if Amazon, the competition-crushing online megastore, were trying to top the success of a rival. Netflix was praised for a sensitive portrayal of an incarcerated transgender woman, played by a transgender woman, on ''Orange Is the New Black,'' so now Amazon, of course, wants in. Worst of all, the setting is Los Angeles, in that familiar world of entitled people consumed by real estate, support groups and play dates. But actually, ''Transparent'' is very good, an insightful, downbeat comedy told without piety or burlesque. The title has another meaning: It's the story of a transitioning parent. Jeffrey Tambor plays a professor, Mort Pfefferman, a divorced father of three grown children, who decides the time has come to reveal a secret that has been burning inside since he was a small child -- in reality, he is Maura. And the show's charm, oddly enough, lies in the main characters' lack of charm. Mr. Tambor is a gifted actor who has been at his best playing strange, self-deluded people in comedies like ''The Larry Sanders Show'' and ''Arrested Development.'' Though some have questioned the casting of a nontransgender performer, he is a bold and inspired choice for the role. There is nothing instantly endearing about Mort or Maura. Mort is bumbling and dreary. Maura has more dignity in a flowing wig and a caftan, but it's hard to get an exact read on her soul. Maura talks a lot in her support group, flipping the ends of her hair like a teenager, the teenager she didn't get to be when she was living life as a boy. Visiting a fellow transgender woman, Maura flits through the friend's apartment, picking up objects, feeling fabrics, inspecting the vanity table, as if trying on this woman's life for size as they talk. It's touching, but also, the way Mr. Tambor does it, a little unsettling, an intrusion that under any other circumstances would be seen as nosy. When Maura, still dressed as Mort, tries to tell the children and can't go through with it, we sympathize with her pain without really knowing yet whether she is a sympathetic person. The children are just as enigmatic. They're glib, witty, close, yet also detached, insecure and self-absorbed. Josh (Jay Duplass), who is successful in the music business, has a very young girlfriend he is grooming as a performer in an all-girl band, Glitterish. Sarah (Amy Landecker) is the oldest child, a wife and mother who feels estranged from her busy, successful husband and her life as a pampered housewife. Ali (Gaby Hoffmann) is the youngest, smart and sardonic, filling silence with Lena Dunham-like riffs and bad ideas for parody books. She is unemployed and shamelessly mooches off her father and her brisk, energetic mother, Shelly (Judith Light). When their father summons them to an important family meeting, Ali agrees with Josh that he must have cancer. The first words that comes to Josh's mind are the tax implications. ''Well if he's really sick,'' Josh says, ''he should start gifting us 12 thou a year now.'' Maura knows her children are selfish, but she nevertheless wants them to understand that their father is not who they thought. The telling doesn't happen all at once, and the suspense is drawn out in an amusing way, but the most beguiling mystery is Maura herself. She is a woman, but viewers have to keep watching to find out what kind. Jeffrey Tambor stars as a transgender woman in Amazon's new series, ''Transparent.'' (PHOTOGRAPH BY AMAZON)",

        "name": "DHL to Begin Deliveries by Drone in Germany ",
        "content": " LONDON \u2014 In the world of drones, Europe is out to show that whatever the United States can do, it can do better. That\u2019s the plan for Friday, when a small pilotless aircraft, or drone, owned by the German logistics company DHL is expected   to take off and ferry medicine to Juist, a sparsely populated island off the northwestern coast of Germany. The flight \u2014 expected to take as long as 30 minutes, depending on weather conditions \u2014 would be the first time a drone without the aid of even a land-based pilot has been authorized for regular use in Europe, the company said. It also follows in the footsteps of similar drone delivery plans by American technology giants. Like Amazon, which is running tests in Canada, and Google, which is conducting tests in Australia, DHL is hoping its monthlong trial will prove that the technology \u2014  dubbed parcelcopter   \u2014 can replace some of the traditional ways of delivering parcels to remote locations. Yet while Google and Amazon have outlined plans to potentially roll out their drone services across large areas, DHL said that it probably would not expand the trial across its global delivery network. Instead, the German logistics company said the drone technology could be used in special situations \u2014 in remote locations, for example \u2014 where it is more cost-effective to use an unmanned aircraft than to send a delivery van or a bike messenger. That\u2019s the case for DHL\u2019s delivery service from Norden, near the northwestern city of Bremen, to Juist, a German island with a population of fewer than 2,000 people. As part of the trial, DHL is expected to send medications twice a day, weather permitting. The deliveries will take place when alternatives, like the local ferry or aircraft services, are not available. When DHL\u2019s drone, which weighs just under three pounds, lands on the island, one of the company\u2019s couriers will then deliver the packages to local residents, a spokeswoman said. One of the major stumbling blocks for companies like Amazon and Google has been a lack of regulatory approval for drone flights. Earlier this year, for example, the Federal Aviation Administration banned a proposed aerial delivery service in Minnesota that would have ferried beer from a brewery to nearby ice fishers. To avoid similar problems, DHL said that it had worked with the German air traffic agency and the country\u2019s Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure to create a restricted flight zone for the company\u2019s drone project. The aircraft will hover 100 feet off the ground and reach speeds of up to 40 miles per hour during the seven-mile journey from the mainland to Juist. While the technology for DHL\u2019s drone project, which began last year, has been well tested, a major stumbling block for the trial may be something the logistics company cannot control: the weather. High winds forecast off the German coast for Friday could delay the initial flight.",

        "name": "E-book battle casts pall over Amazon\u2019s lavish fete for writers; Rifts opened by conflict with Hachette carry over to annual Campfire event ",
        "content": " Every fall, Mr. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, hosts Campfire, a literary weekend in Santa Fe, N.M. Dozens of well-known novelists have attended, but they do not talk about the abundance of high-end clothing and other gifts, the lavish meals or the private planes that ferried some home. Writers loved it. There was no hard sell of Amazon, or soft sell, either. Mr. Bezos, the man who sells half the books in America, seemed to want nothing more each year than for everyone to have a good time. All he asked in return was silence. For four years, the bargain held. But the fifth Campfire, which writers say took place over the weekend, is a little different. Amazon\u2019s battle with Hachette, the fourth-largest publisher, is fracturing the secrecy and sapping some of the good will. (Amazon would not confirm that the event was even happening.) The struggle between the retailer and the publisher is ostensibly over the price of e-books but really over profit margins and, ultimately, the future of publishing. The conflict, which is unlike any in recent publishing history, has inflamed tensions across the literary spectrum. It began six months ago and appears unlikely to end any time soon. Some repeat Campfire attendees who have supported Hachette in the dispute said that they had not been invited this year. Others said that they were having second thoughts about going. The event has become as divisive as the fight. \u2018\u2018My guess is a lot of writers turned it down this year,\u2019\u2019 said James Patterson, who attended last year\u2019s festivities. Mr. Patterson, whose novels are published by Hachette, gave a speech in May, when he warned that Amazon needed to be stopped \u2018\u2018by law if necessary, immediately.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018I wasn\u2019t invited again, and I wouldn\u2019t have gone if I had been,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I would feel very odd being there.\u2019\u2019 He noted, however, that the event had been \u2018\u2018terrific.\u2019\u2019 Hugh Howey, a self-published science fiction novelist who is one of Amazon\u2019s most dedicated defenders, is in Santa Fe but said he had not wanted to go. \u2018\u2018I asked not to be invited back this year, as I want to be able to speak my mind and not have any hint of a quid pro quo,\u2019\u2019 he wrote in an email. But this kind of openness is not for everyone. Some writers, when contacted about their past attendance and asked whether they were going this year, reacted with something akin to terror. One writer begged not to be mentioned in any way, insisting that it was a private, off-the-record event and should remain so, lest Mr. Bezos be offended. The Amazon mogul does not make attendees sign nondisclosure forms. His team just cautions them that the weekend is off the record. Even those who like to share their every thought on Twitter and Facebook have kept it that way. Ayelet Waldman has attended Campfire with her husband, Michael Chabon. Both novelists signed an open letter this summer in support of Hachette authors, whose books Amazon is making it harder to buy as a way to achieve leverage in the dispute. Ms. Waldman, who gained fame by publicly chronicling some of her most intimate feelings, including loving her husband more than her children, did not respond to emails about Campfire. An Amazon spokesman declined to discuss Campfire. A spokesman for Mr. Bezos did not respond to a message seeking comment. Traces of Campfire on the Internet are decidedly rare. A publishing newsletter mentioned the 2011 event, saying it included Jeff Tweedy of the band Wilco and the directors Jason Reitman and Werner Herzog. Diversified Production Services, which helped stage the 2011 event, describes it on its website as a \u2018\u2018private gathering and conference of influential artists, writers, activists and scientists for a sharing of inspiration and stories.\u2019\u2019 The company listed the \u2018\u2018featured talent\u2019\u2019 that year as the astronaut Neil Armstrong as well as the writer Margaret Atwood, the musicians T Bone Burnett and Moby, and George Martin (presumably the \u2018\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019\u2019 novelist, George R.R. Martin). A spokeswoman for Ms. Atwood declined to comment except to point out that she was in Europe over the weekend. Mr. Martin could not be reached. Mr. Armstrong died in 2012. Whether or not fear of Amazon is legitimate, it exists. When Authors United, a group of writers, reprinted the open letter denouncing Amazon\u2019s tactics in the Hachette dispute as an advertisement in The New York Times, 17 writers and a trust split the bill. Douglas Preston, the founder of the group, said the writers willing to be identified were Mr. Patterson, David Baldacci, Lee Child, Nelson DeMille, Amanda Foreman, Stephen King, Nora Roberts, Stacy Schiff and Scott Turow. Mr. Preston also paid a share, as did the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust. Seven other contributors asked to remain anonymous. \u2018\u2018They were quite specifically worried about the possibility that Amazon would single them out for punishment,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Preston said. An Amazon spokesman did not respond to questions on the subject of fear. Campfire this year was held under the conditions of utmost secrecy, as usual. Mr. Bezos rented the entire Bishop\u2019s Lodge Ranch Resort and Spa, which is set on 450 acres a little north of Santa Fe. If you call the front desk seeking a particular guest, the operator will not ring the room or even take a message. There are guards at the front gate to prevent the curious from getting too far. Mr. Bezos, who built Amazon from its dot-com roots as a bookseller into one of America\u2019s biggest retailers, knows the psychology of writers, several past attendees said in interviews. \u2018\u2018You come to this exclusive event, you are treated fabulously and you get access to the next Steve Jobs, who happens to control how many books you sell,\u2019\u2019 one said. Employees at Amazon\u2019s headquarters in Seattle have to pay for their perks, down to the treats from vending machines. And the company is famously tough on its suppliers; the Hachette conflict is just one example. At Campfire, however, there is no stinting. There are impressive dinners, accompanied by live music. There is horseback riding, skeet shooting and lazing by the pool. In the mornings, there are formal talks on highbrow topics. One guest fondly recalled that the swag included down vests, fleeces, shoulder bags and small suitcases to carry all the loot home. Getting back to mundane reality was postponed for the attendees who took one of the private jets. (Others say they took scheduled flights.) Mr. Howey said Campfire was nonpartisan. \u2018\u2018They invite all kinds of people with all kinds of stances,\u2019\u2019 he wrote in his email. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve heard suggest that people turned this down, so I\u2019m inferring from you that the Hachette standoff has created tension?\u2019\u2019 The literary world overflows with tension and invective these days. People are choosing sides. Maxine Hong Kingston, who was awarded a National Medal of Arts by President Obama in July, was a Campfire attendee but is not coming back. She signed the open letter.",

        "name": "Amazon Workers Walk Off the Job in Germany Over Wage Dispute ",
        "content": " BERLIN \u2014 Amazon employees in Germany, frustrated by the company\u2019s refusal to hold wage talks, walked off their jobs Monday in a coordinated strike at four of the company\u2019s distribution centers. A total of 2,000 workers refused to show up for their shifts on Monday in an effort to force the company to accept an agreement in line with other retailers. The job action was expected to run from the early shift Monday through the late shift on Tuesday, said the Ver.di retail and service workers union, which organized the strike. Amazon said the number of employees taking part in the strike during the first shift was not significant enough to prevent the company from making its deliveries on time. \u2018\u2018Less than 600 employees of the early shift have followed the call to strike action,\u2019\u2019 Anette Nachbar, a spokeswoman for Amazon in Germany, said in an email. \u2018\u2018Therefore the strike will not impede on the compliance with Amazon\u2019s delivery promise.\u2019\u2019 The company employs some 9,000 full-time workers in Germany, with thousands more on temporary contracts. At the heart of the issue is an attempt by Ver.di to force Amazon to recognize itself as a retailer, which would make it beholden to labor laws that require wages be set through collective bargaining. But Amazon insists that its warehouses are logistics centers, \u2018\u2018not shops frequented by customers.\u2019\u2019 Instead, most of its workers are involved in taking goods from shelves, packing and shipping them, and for their services, they receive wages at the upper end of the pay range for logistics workers, Amazon says. Ver.di has been fighting Amazon since spring 2013, holding successive walkouts at different times, but Monday\u2019s was the first coordinated action to be held simultaneously by workers at the four facilities \u2014 at Bad Hersfeld, Leipzig, Graben and Rheinberg. \u2018\u2018The workers are demanding their right to a collective bargaining agreement and fair labor conditions,\u2019\u2019 said Stefanie Nutzenberger, a Ver.di member who is responsible for retail. The union said that Amazon had agreed to increase wages by 2.1 percent to 3 percent in its Graben location, which it attributed to pressure from the strikes. The union said it would keep up the strikes but acknowledged that it was in for a long fight. In the meantime, Amazon has been expanding into neighboring Poland, where two warehouses are opening this month and a third is scheduled to begin operation in October. Two more centers in the Czech Republic are also to be running to serve the German market in time for the Christmas rush. In addition to its labor woes, Amazon is embroiled in a price dispute with the German division of the Bonnier publishing group over e-book pricing, similar to its conflict with Hachette in the United States. Germans consider books to be of unique cultural value and have laws to prevent retailers from offering discounts on printed copies. Last week, the Frankfurt state court ordered Amazon to cease discounting books for disgruntled customers, which violates the publishing industry\u2019s retail price agreements. If it flouts the order, Amazon will face a fine of up to 250,000 euros, or $300,000. Neither dispute appears to have reduced the appetite of Germans for the convenience of ordering books, clothes and gadgets through Amazon, which saw net sales in Germany grow for the third consecutive year last year, to $10.5 billion.",

        "name": "Loosening Limits of Media Sharing, but Only Slightly ",
        "content": " Quietly nestled in Apple's new iOS 8 mobile operating system is a feature called Family Sharing. It lets you share books, movies, music and apps that you've bought at iTunes, iBooks and the App Store with up to six members of your family who are logged in using their own iTunes accounts. So if you bought a song, app or book you really like, and you want to share it with your spouse or child or maybe a sister, you can register their email addresses with Apple and enable limited sharing of digital media. Amazon announced a similar feature on Wednesday called Family Library, although it applies only to digital books, apps, movies and TV, and audiobooks bought through Amazon or its Prime Instant Video service -- not music. And the sharing is restricted to the accounts of two adults and four children. In theory, these services sound like a great benefit because if you're an Apple user you don't have to let your family log in with your iTunes account. And, at least with Apple's service, you can share an MP3 with someone without worrying that you're somehow infringing copyright by doing so. But this seemingly generous allowance could also be viewed as a limit that's a result of rigid copyright laws and licensing restrictions. In the physical world, you can share a book or DVD or CD that you bought with as many friends and family as you like. You can even sell those items if you want, thanks to the first sale doctrine. But digital media has been excluded from that doctrine, because, essentially, when you buy a digital song or movie or book, you're being granted a license to use that media, but you don't actually own it. As a result, there are far more restrictions on what you can do with an MP3 than on what you can do with a CD. The music, movie, TV and book industries have historically been resistant to anything that resembled the sharing of the digital versions of their goods. One recent example was Amazon's attempt to let customers lend their digital books to friends for a limited time. The lending process itself is byzantine: The recipient has it for just 14 days, finding the options to loan and return books is difficult, and that's assuming you can find a title that is actually available to lend out. Realistically, if you buy a Kindle book and then tell a friend how much you loved it, you're either telling them to buy it themselves or offering to buy a gift certificate. So, while Family Sharing and Family Library seem like a victory at first, ''to me, this is really a failure of our copyright law,'' said Corynne McSherry, who heads intellectual property policy research at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ''It presupposes that the content owners should be able to have that kind of control over what they buy,'' she said. ''Copyright law isn't changing with our times, because what doesn't change is that people want to be able to give someone a copy of a book or song that they legally bought.'' ''The fact is,'' Ms. McSherry said, ''that we need Amazon or Apple to have elaborate license agreements in order to make it possible for their customers to be able to do what they should be able to do anyway.'' The Family Sharing and Family Library features are already far more restrictive than, obviously, handing someone a book or CD. In the short term, it will indeed be nice to be able to share a digital book or song with a partner or family member. But don't lose sight of the fact that you're being allowed to do so, with the assumption that the alternative would have made you a pirate. And these new services also let Apple and Amazon track the way you and your family use and consume media -- what you read, watch, listen to and download. It may be personal sharing, but it's not all that private. The world of digital media still hasn't caught up to the simplicity of the physical world; this is a tiny step, but it's still not quite enough.",

Two of the attendees this year, as in past years, are Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer, who are married.

        "name": "A headlong rush, despite the risks; When investors pile into a stock, it\u2019s time to start asking questions ",
        "content": " With the Alibaba Group to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, many people may have been asking, \u2018\u2018Ali who?\u2019\u2019 Professional investors, of course, already know that Alibaba is a fast-growing, hugely profitable Chinese company that is a combination of eBay and Amazon, with a little bit of Google thrown in. They like it so much that they have stampeded to Alibaba\u2019s initial public offering, making it the largest ever on the United States stock market. The deal raised $21.8 billion for Alibaba and gives it an overall market value of $168 billion, two and a half times the size of eBay. Still, once the so-called smart money piles into a stock, it\u2019s usually time to start asking dumb questions. And with Alibaba, there are many. Can the company, which today dominates Chinese e-commerce, fend off competition forever? What about its odd corporate structure? Who, exactly, is checking the company\u2019s books? And why did Alibaba recently spend more than a quarter\u2019s worth of cash flow on what seemed like a grab bag of investments? In many fundamental ways, investing in Alibaba is nothing like owning a slice of a typical American corporation. It requires far more trust. But as the rush into Alibaba\u2019s public offering shows, mutual funds, hedge funds and pensions are falling over themselves to back the company. \u2018\u2018You\u2019ve got a world that is starved for growth, and this segment of the Chinese capital markets offers a high degree of growth,\u2019\u2019 said Brendan Ahern of KraneShares, a mutual fund firm that invests in Chinese companies. For many, the allure of Alibaba is in its headline numbers. Alibaba makes most of its revenue from fees and commissions that it receives from the two large Internet marketplaces it operates in China: Taobao is a frenetic and eclectic online bazaar that offers a huge range of goods. Tmall, by contrast, is a more refined platform that established brands use to sell their goods. Together, Alibaba\u2019s marketplaces sold $296 billion worth of goods in the 12 months through the end of June, which is estimated to be more than Amazon and eBay combined. These kinds of numbers have persuaded some analysts that Alibaba\u2019s shares could trade well above its $68 offering price. James Cordwell of Atlantic Equities, for instance, says that Alibaba is worth about $100 a share, or 30 times the $3.35 a share that he estimates the company will make in profits in 2016. Alibaba, he contends, deserves a multiple of 30 times because that is in line with other Chinese Internet companies \u2014 and he expects Alibaba\u2019s earnings to grow at about 30 percent a year. \u2018\u2018Alibaba is highly profitable,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It is easier to value than Facebook and Twitter at their I.P.O.s.\u2019\u2019 But even bullish analysts like Mr. Cordwell have their concerns. A big one is whether Alibaba will end up spending a lot of money to stockpile goods and distribute them. Right now, a main attraction of Alibaba is that it does not consume large amounts of cash holding inventory, as is the custom for most retailers, including Amazon. Alibaba\u2019s offering also effectively asks investors to give up some basic rights and protections. As is the case with any public company, outside investors have no real way of testing the accuracy of the Alibaba\u2019s financial filings themselves. Investors usually expect outside auditors to assess a company\u2019s books. American investors might take some comfort in the fact that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regulates audit firms, to help ensure they are doing their job. But the Chinese government does not allow the board to inspect Chinese audit firms. And the regulator has not inspected Alibaba\u2019s auditor, PricewaterhouseCooper\u2019s affiliate in Hong Kong. Alibaba\u2019s corporate structure is another reason to pause. The actual entity that is going public, the Alibaba Group, is not based in the United States, but in the Cayman Islands. This entity also does not give investors a true ownership stake in Alibaba\u2019s operating businesses. Instead, the Alibaba Group merely has contractual rights to profits from the businesses, an arrangement that allows foreign investors to effectively find a way around Chinese law that would otherwise ban such investment. Adding to concerns over control, Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s executive chairman, has majority stakes in the company\u2019s underlying Chinese entities. Shareholders might find it hard to rein in Mr. Ma and his associates if they make decisions that outside shareholders disagree with. This fear arose a few years ago when Mr. Ma unexpectedly spun out Alipay, the company\u2019s payments business, causing a rift with Yahoo, which has a big stake in Alibaba. Alibaba has recently made a string of deals that raised eyebrows. In April, the company lent $1 billion to Simon Xie, one of its founders, to finance an investment. Alibaba also took a stake in a Chinese soccer team this year. And after buying a movie production company, Alibaba said that it might have unearthed accounting irregularities, suggesting it did not do good due diligence. The acquisition numbers are not insignificant: The $1.85 billion that Alibaba spent on acquisitions in the second quarter exceeded the $1.64 billion in cash flows from the company\u2019s operations.",

        "name": "With Eye on Rivals, Amazon Refreshes Its Line of Kindles ",
        "content": " For years, Amazon, the online retail giant, has been trying to change that. The company's latest effort comes in a refresh of its Kindle tablets and e-readers, announced Wednesday evening, with a set of internal hardware improvements and updated software features that Amazon hopes will woo new crowds to its line of devices. Amazon's strategy: Go after different types of people with many different devices. Take the updated Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 tablet. It now includes a powerful 2.5 GHz Snapdragon processor from Qualcomm and comes with the WPS Office app, essentially a way to create and edit documents from the tablet. The app is integrated with Amazon's Cloud Drive, which will back up documents on Amazon's servers. Amazon has also built a Fire Keyboard, which connects wirelessly to the HDX 8.9 tablet via Bluetooth. The aim here, it seems, is to go after the segment of the market that wants to use a tablet as a workstation, instead of toting around a laptop. In other words, it's the same audience that Microsoft has tried to court with its Surface tablet. ''We have all the power and performance you need to multitask,'' said Jonathan Oakes, a director of product management for Amazon, at a media event on Wednesday. ''Now we're just making it easier to switch between all the things people want to do.'' The HDX will cost $379, which is also about the cost of Microsoft's Surface RT, depending on which model you buy. But modeling the new Kindle after the Surface is questionable, as the Surface has hardly flown off the shelves. Microsoft took a $900 million write-down on unsold Surface RTs last year. For what it's worth, the HDX also comes with a sound system upgrade, courtesy of Dolby, as well as improved graphics processing and a better display, which could appeal to media-hungry consumers. So it's not all business. Amazon isn't just aiming at grown-ups. The Kindle Fire HD Kids Edition, for instance, aims for the opposite end of the market. For $149, Amazon offers an updated 6-inch Kindle Fire HD tablet with front-and-rear-facing cameras, an improved display and a better microprocessor. It also comes in an array of pretty colors, much like Apple's iPods. The hook, however, is the guarantee that comes with the device. If your child breaks the tablet, Amazon will replace it for up to two years. The shockproof rubber case that comes in the package will probably help protect against that, too. The device also allows for full access to ''FreeTime Unlimited,'' Amazon's child-friendly section of videos, apps and games. So for about $50 more than the cost of a new Kindle Fire HD, you are essentially buying an extended warranty for a nice child's toy. Finally, for those who just want to read on their tablet, Amazon has updated its classic line of e-readers. The refresh includes a new $79 Kindle -- the lowest-price option -- as well as a new high-end model, the Voyage, a thin, lightweight reader with an improved front light and touch-screen capability. The Voyage is not cheap; at $199, it is Amazon's most expensive e-reader. Amazon's fall line comes months before the holiday season, when manufacturers like Samsung, Lenovo and Apple will all push their tablets heavily to gift-seekers. But while Amazon has heavily marketed its Fire Tablet products, how successful the company has been in winning over consumers is unclear. Amazon has never broken out its tablet sales numbers. Estimates from analysts, however, show Amazon's tablet sales dwarfed by its competition. Amazon shipped an estimated 200,000 tablets in the second quarter of 2014, 22nd among tablet manufacturers worldwide, according to IDC, a research firm. For comparison, Apple sold 13.3 million iPads over the same period. Kinley Pearsall, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to provide an exact number for the company's Kindle sales. However, Ms. Pearsall said that IDC's estimated numbers were ''way off and way low.'' Ultimately, the tablets are a means to an end, a portal to Amazon's major business of selling goods and services and shipping them to customers around the world. In some cases, Amazon is probably making little to no money on each tablet sold, but it counts on making up for that by selling content like digital books and movies to tablet shoppers. Still, to bolster online shopping, Amazon needs to sell more tablets. And that is easier said than done. The new Kindle Fall lineup was available for pre-order on Amazon's site beginning Wednesday evening. David Streitfeld contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 tablet now includes a powerful 2.5 GHz Snapdragon processor from Qualcomm and comes with the WPS Office app.; A high-end model, the Voyage, is a lightweight reader with an improved light and touch-screen capability.",

        "content": " Twilio , a company that offers cheap voice and short messaging services to mobile phones via Amazon Web Services, said on Thursday that it would offer businesses and software developers the ability to send multimedia. Twilio currently  enables things like   call centers at an average price of a penny a minute. The notifications from Uber that a driver is coming, or Coca-Cola\u2019s dispatches to its technicians are both run via Twilio. During recent protests on net neutrality, Twilio handled about 50,000 calls to members of Congress. The new capability means that an airline could send a boarding pass to a phone. Other applications could include providing a photograph of a service worker on his way to a job, for higher security; displaying a product or a video of a vacation home to a phone; or sending coupons or loyalty cards to people after they spend a certain amount or enter a mall. \u201cThis is going to create experiences that make using smartphones even more attractive,\u201d said Jeff Lawson, Twilio\u2019s co-founder and chief executive. \u201cWe believe photos and videos will be ubiquitous.\u201d That might explain how Twilio was able to persuade United States phone networks to carry its traffic. Twilio may perform its software magic inside Amazon Web Services, but it still has to get permission from big carriers like AT&T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile to carry the traffic to and from consumer devices. \u201cWe\u2019re helping the carriers give their subscribers the services they want,\u201d Mr. Lawson said. \u201cIf Uber doesn\u2019t work on your phone by now, it\u2019s bad.\u201d Put another way, the carriers may have to forsake charging a lot for every service, so as to keep customers on their expensive phone contracts. The new video and image service works via MMS, which stands for multimedia messaging service. The older text services on Twilio worked on a different short message service, or SMS, system. MMS services are currently available on phone networks, but can take months to procure and deploy, and cost at least $10,000 annually. Twilio charges people $1 a phone number, and then at most a couple of cents a message. It can, on its debut, potentially work on millions of United States and Canadian phone numbers. What developers may do with the new capability will probably start to be known within a couple of months. Mr. Lawson said Twilio would try to expand the network internationally, much the way its phone and text services are currently used. With 1,200 carriers globally, he acknowledged, this could take awhile.",

        "name": "Hachette\u2019s writers take appeal directly to Amazon board ",
        "content": " Amazon is at war with Hachette, and it sometimes seems as if it has always been that way. As a negotiating tool in the battle, which is over the price of e-books, Amazon is discouraging its customers from buying the publisher\u2019s printed books. After six months of being largely cut off from what is by far the largest bookstore in the United States, many Hachette writers are fearful and angry. So this week, they are trying a new tactic to get their work unshackled. Authors United, a group of Hachette writers and their allies, is appealing directly to Amazon\u2019s board. It is warning the board that the reputation of the retailer, and of the directors themselves, is at risk. \u2018\u2018Efforts to impede or block the sale of books have a long and ugly history,\u2019\u2019 reads a letter being posted to the group\u2019s website on Monday morning. \u2018\u2018Do you, personally, want to be associated with this?\u2019\u2019 Amazon takes its good name seriously. In the Harris Poll of corporate reputations, it once again took top honors this year. But that prestige is taking a bit of a beating as the fight with Hachette drags on. The disastrous reception for Amazon\u2019s first smartphone, which sold so poorly that the company dropped the price last week to 99 cents, has been another blow. The letter warns the directors that the discontent might spread. \u2018\u2018Since its founding, Amazon has been a highly regarded and progressive brand,\u2019\u2019 it says. \u2018\u2018But if this is how Amazon continues to treat the literary community, how long will the company\u2019s fine reputation last?\u2019\u2019 Among Amazon\u2019s board members are Patricia Q. Stonesifer, the former head of the Gates Foundation; Jamie S. Gorelick, deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration; John Seely Brown, former director of Xerox\u2019s research center; Thomas O. Ryder, former chief executive of Reader\u2019s Digest; and Judith McGrath, former MTV chairwoman, who officially begins next month. Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, is chairman. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment for this article. The 1,100 Authors United members, who include Stephen King, John Grisham and Robert A. Caro, have until Wednesday to sign the letter. Then it will be sent to Amazon\u2019s 10 board members. The letter follows an ad in The New York Times last month that asked readers to email Mr. Bezos and ask him to relent. The ad, like the letter, was the brainchild of Douglas Preston, a thriller writer whose books are published by Hachette. Mr. Preston\u2019s sales have dropped substantially since Amazon started squeezing sales of Hachette books in the spring. Anyone contemplating ordering his latest novel, \u2018\u2018The Lost Island,\u2019\u2019 written with Lincoln Child, is warned it might take as long as three weeks to arrive. That, as Amazon and its customers know, might as well be forever. Amazon wants to pay Hachette less for e-books, saying it will pass the savings on to consumers. Hachette\u2019s position, as it said in a public statement, is that 80 percent of its e-books are already at the price Amazon wants \u2014 $9.99 \u2014 and that \u2018\u2018Amazon is seeking a lot more profit and even more market share\u2019\u2019 at the expense of authors, other bookstores and publishers. \u2018\u2018If not for our effort, I believe Amazon would have started targeting Simon & Schuster books by now, as they are reportedly involved in similar tough negotiations,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Preston said. \u2018\u2018I can only hope Amazon will think twice before they employ these scorched-earth tactics again.\u2019\u2019 People who wrote to Mr. Bezos said they had received no response. Amazon declined to say how many emails it had received. Hachette and Amazon are still negotiating, and a resolution is not out of the question. But in some ways the parties seem to be digging in for the long haul, as the crucial fall selling season gets underway. In response to Mr. Preston\u2019s initial efforts, Amazon opened a counterattack, setting up its own group, Readers United. Amazon emailed writers it published through various programs, including the Kindle Direct self-publishing division, and asked them to send a letter to Hachette\u2019s chief executive. To make sure the correct message was sent, Amazon offered a list of talking points. The first was, \u2018\u2018We have noted your illegal collusion,\u2019\u2019 a reference to the antitrust suit brought by the government against Hachette and other publishers in 2012. And it instructed its correspondents to send Amazon a copy of all emails. In making its case to the writers, Amazon said that George Orwell had been in favor of suppressing books, a statement the Orwell estate called worthy of the Ministry of Truth in \u2018\u20181984.\u2019\u2019 Amazon\u2019s request prompted quite a bit of controversy among writers who use its platform. One of the talking points suggested by Amazon was that Hachette \u2018\u2018stop using your authors as leverage.\u2019\u2019 But to some Amazon writers, it seemed as if they were being used for leverage. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not your army, O.K.?\u2019\u2019 the novelist Chuck Wendig wrote on his popular blog. Although Amazon referred to the antitrust suit against publishers, it has its own conflicts with regulators. It is currently being sued by the United States Federal Trade Commission for billing parents for millions of dollars in unauthorized app charges run up by their children. Amazon denies the accusations. Those who wrote the Hachette chief, Michael Pietsch, got a lengthy response outlining the publisher\u2019s position. Hachette declined to say how many emails it received. If any writer might have been receptive to Amazon\u2019s call to arms, it would be Mishka Shubaly. Mr. Shubaly was a remorseless alcoholic who finally pulled his life together five years ago. He began writing for Amazon\u2019s Kindle Singles line, which publishes long digital narratives. Mr. Shubaly\u2019s account of his redemption through running, as well as other episodes from a colorful life, won a receptive audience from readers. His six Kindle Singles have earned him more than $200,000. \u2018\u2018I will never be able to adequately express my gratitude to Amazon,\u2019\u2019 the writer said. \u2018\u2018If Jeff Bezos called me in the middle of the night and asked me to move a dead body, I would do it.\u2019\u2019 And yet. Mr. Shubaly, 37, hails from the punk rock tradition, which means suspicion of capitalism is in his blood. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m a fan of small independent businesses,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018The more variety of bookstores and booksellers out there, the better.\u2019\u2019 So when Amazon sent the email asking him to march on Hachette, he deleted it after reading only a few paragraphs. \u2018\u2018I think ambivalence is the only proper response that a writer can have to this dispute,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Shubaly, who is now writing a memoir for Public Affairs. Hachette said this summer that it was buying a group of smaller publishers including Public Affairs, but the deal fell apart. Hachette writers, being closer to the line of fire, are less ambivalent. Meryl Gordon\u2019s \u2018\u2018The Phantom of Fifth Avenue,\u2019\u2019 a biography of the heiress Huguette Clark, was published by Hachette in late May. \u2018\u2018Amazon has done everything possible to discourage sales of my book, from refusing preorders to lengthy shipping delays to charging $10 more than Barnes & Noble,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Gordon said. \u2018\u2018The whole experience made me very angry.\u2019\u2019 But not at Hachette. A few weeks ago, the writer signed a contract with the embattled publisher for her next book, a biography of Bunny Mellon. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m loyal. And had I shopped it around to another publisher, there\u2019s no guarantee they would not be Amazon\u2019s next target,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Gordon said. \u2018\u2018Hachette was just the first in line.\u2019\u2019 CORRECTION: As published in the International New York Times An article on Tuesday about efforts by an alliance of writers to end a dispute between Amazon.com and the publisher Hachette that has cut into their book sales rendered incorrectly the name of another publisher for which Mishka Shubaly, who writes for Amazon\u2019s Kindle Singles line, is writing a memoir.

        "content": " Amazon   is at war with Hachette, and it sometimes seems as if it has always been that way. As a negotiating tool in  the battle   , which is over the price of e-books, Amazon is discouraging its customers from buying the publisher\u2019s printed books. After six months of being largely cut off from what is by far the largest bookstore in the country, many Hachette writers are fearful and angry. So this week, they are trying a new tactic to get their work unshackled. Authors United, a group of Hachette writers and their allies, is appealing directly to Amazon\u2019s board. It is warning the board that the reputation of the retailer, and of the directors themselves, is at risk. \u201cEfforts to impede or block the sale of books have a long and ugly history,\u201d reads  a letter being posted to the   group\u2019s website on Monday morning.   \u201cDo you, personally, want to be associated with this?\u201d Amazon takes its good name seriously. In the Harris Poll of corporate reputations, it once again took top honors this year. But that prestige is taking a bit of a beating as the fight with Hachette drags on. The disastrous reception of Amazon\u2019s first smartphone, which sold so poorly that the company was forced last week to  drop the   price to 99 cents   , has been another blow. The letter warns the directors that the discontent might spread. \u201cSince its founding, Amazon has been a highly regarded and progressive brand,\u201d it says. \u201cBut if this is how Amazon continues to treat the literary community, how long will the company\u2019s fine reputation last?\u201d Among Amazon\u2019s board members are Patricia Q. Stonesifer, the former head of the Gates Foundation; Jamie S. Gorelick, deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration; John Seely Brown, former director of Xerox\u2019s research center; Thomas O. Ryder, former chief executive of Reader\u2019s Digest; and Judith McGrath, former MTV chairwoman, who officially begins next month.  Jeffrey P. Bezos   , Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, is chairman. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment for this article. The 1,100 Authors United members, who include Stephen King, John Grisham and Robert A. Caro, have until Wednesday to sign the letter. Then it will be sent to Amazon\u2019s 10 board members. The letter follows an  ad in The New York Times   last month that asked readers to email Mr. Bezos and ask him to relent. The ad, like the letter, was the brainchild of Douglas Preston, a thriller writer whose books are published by Hachette. Mr. Preston\u2019s sales have dropped substantially since Amazon started squeezing sales of Hachette books in the spring. Anyone contemplating ordering his latest novel, \u201cThe Lost Island,\u201d written with Lincoln Child, is warned it might take as long as three weeks to arrive. That, as Amazon and its customers know, might as well be forever. Amazon wants to pay Hachette less for e-books, saying it will pass the savings on to consumers. Hachette\u2019s position, as it said in a public statement, is that 80 percent of its e-books are already at the price Amazon wants $9.99 \u2014 and that \u201cAmazon is seeking a lot more profit and even more market share\u201d at the expense of authors, other bookstores and publishers. \u201cIf not for our effort, I believe Amazon would have started  targeting Simon & Schuster books   by now, as they are reportedly involved in similar tough negotiations,\u201d Mr. Preston said. \u201cI can only hope Amazon will think twice before they employ these scorched-earth tactics again.\u201d People who wrote to Mr. Bezos said they received no response.

        "name": "HP Commits to the Cloud ",
        "content": " For what probably amounts to a relatively small amount of money, Hewlett-Packard just made a big bet. Thursday afternoon, HP said it had entered an agreement to acquire a company called Eucalyptus, which makes open source software for managing cloud computing systems. The chief executive of Eucalyptus, Marten Mickos, will become general manager of HP's cloud computing business, reporting directly to Meg Whitman, HP's chief executive. The price was not disclosed, but it probably was not significant when compared with HP's $112 billion in annual revenue. The price tag matters less than what the deal says about HP's intention to build products that in many ways will undermine its existing revenue in several product areas. HP wants to sell cloud systems to private companies, with options for these clouds to interact with Amazon Web Services, along with other so-called public clouds, a term for cloud systems available from big providers for rent by companies and individuals. HP is also offering its own cloud system, which it can operate on behalf of private companies with more exclusivity than AWS can offer. To make all that work, the HP cloud systems will rely on lots of software besides Eucalyptus, including products that proxy on top of cheap computer servers the kind of data storage and networking that HP also sells. In addition, the tech giant will have to rely less on revenue from selling hardware, and more on software and service contracts. ''Success will be a tight alignment of many parts of the company,'' said Mr. Mickos. ''We have to figure out how to work together. Eucalyptus, which came out of an open source project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, had several thousand users of the free software, but far fewer paying customers. The company's main selling point was that its software was interoperable with AWS. Putting services and hardware together in new ways is part of ''the hard hill we are in the process of climbing,'' said Martin Fink, HP's chief technology officer and the head of HP Labs, where much of the development is taking place. ''Is there uncertainty? There is always uncertainty.'' He added that Ms. Whitman has determined that this is where customers are going, so HP needs to adjust its business accordingly. If HP wants to show determination to change with this deal, Mr. Mickos is a particularly telling executive to put in charge of the cloud business. He previously sold MySQL, an open source database company, to Sun Microsystems for $1 billion in 2008. Besides making enough money personally to be able to pick where (and if) he works, Mr. Mickos got an up-close view of a company that couldn't change with the times. Sun was purchased by Oracle for $7.4 billion in 2009. He is also on the board of Nokia, which last year was forced to sell its once-mighty phone business to Microsoft. While MySQL helped make Sun attractive to Oracle (it may be why Sun bought the company), Mr. Mickos says his experience taught him how to judge corporate commitment. ''All big changes must start from the top,'' he said. ''At the highest level Sun didn't take the decisions it needed to. I see a board at HP that takes very seriously the change.'' He added, ''they have the patience and determination for something that can take years.'' The deal is one of several that signal changing times in the computer business. Last year Dell went private at a cost of $25 billion, in part to retool itself for cloud computing. Last January, IBM sold its low-end server business to Lenovo, since it couldn't compete profitably enough in the commodity business of servers for data centers. Taiwan's Quanta, another commodity server maker, now ships pre-configured racks of servers and software to companies like Facebook, at times supplying 80 percent of that company's servers. In April, HP and Foxconn, another bulk assembly company, announced a joint venture to produce cloud-optimized servers a deal that combined perhaps some loss of autonomy for HP with an impressive pragmatism about the current market.",

        "name": "Recognizing tech firms in the phones they make; Recent devices say a lot about how companies tackle almost everything ",
        "content": " It was a big week for smartphones. Apple unveiled two new iPhones \u2014 as well as a new smartwatch, which you can think of as a phone for your wrist. Amazon slashed the price of its new phone, and Microsoft, searching for new applications and content for its own struggling mobile platform, sought to acquire the company behind the blockbuster game Minecraft. What can we glean about these three companies \u2014 and a fourth, Samsung \u2014 from their smartphones? A whole lot about their approach to everything. IPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus Introduced with great fanfare in 2007, the iPhone was one of the few tech products in recent memory that overdelivered on its hype. The iPhone spurred worldwide demand for powerful devices that we carry with us always, everywhere. The new crop of iPhones suggests that under Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, the company has emerged from the shadow of Steve Jobs, its revered co-founder. Mr. Jobs hated big phones, but the new versions, with screens measuring 4.7 and 5.5 inches diagonally, are gigantic. Apple\u2019s new operating system allows users to customize their phones in ways that might have made Mr. Jobs livid. These changes suggest a more open, less aloof Apple \u2014 and one bent on making sure that the iPhone remains the most profitable gadget in the tech business. Amazon Fire Phone Amazon entered the smartphone business just this year, which is a bit like showing up for a New Year\u2019s Eve party after the ball has dropped. The tardiness might have been forgivable if Jeff Bezos, the chief executive, had done what Amazon has always done in new markets: make a very cheap, basic thing, and then compete on price, customer service and ubiquity. But something odd happened with the Fire Phone. Amazon stuffed it to the gills with bells and whistles that few people seemed to want, including a head-tracking system that allowed for a mostly useless 3-D effect. Then there was the price. Amazon sold this novel, unknown phone for $199 with a two-year contract, the same price as that of other high-end rivals. No one was impressed. Analysts say Amazon has sold only a few tens of thousands of the phones; the company seemed to confirm the dismal numbers when it cut the price to 99 cents, with a contract. But Mr. Bezos has a special talent for tweaking his products until they click. So it wouldn\u2019t be wise to count Amazon out of the smartphone game just yet. Samsung Galaxy S5 and Note 4 Samsung is known in the tech business as a \u2018\u2018fast follower,\u2019\u2019 a derisive term meant to suggest that it can\u2019t come up with its own good ideas. When it comes to smartphones, Samsung responded to the iPhone\u2019s rise by releasing many phones that appeared to closely mimic the hardware and software in Apple\u2019s juggernaut. The plan worked: Samsung quickly became the world\u2019s largest smartphone company, outselling even Apple. Because it sells a lot of those phones for cut-rate prices, Samsung\u2019s smartphone profits still lag behind Apple\u2019s. But Samsung\u2019s business has been buoyed by its relentless experimentation. It will try anything, even ideas that at first seem mindless, because who knows what will work in tech? In 2011, Samsung released one such device, a 5.3-inch phone called the Galaxy Note, a phone so big that Gizmodo scoffed that it was \u2018\u2018hardly even designed for humans.\u2019\u2019 Guess what? People loved it, and thus was born the combination phone and tablet, or phablet. Phablets have become a significant portion of the high-end smartphone market, arguably cutting into Apple\u2019s profits. Which explains, in part, Apple\u2019s new big phone. Who\u2019s the fast follower now? Microsoft\u2019s Nokia Lumia 930 \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share,\u2019\u2019 Steve Ballmer, Microsoft\u2019s former chief executive, declared on the eve of Apple\u2019s smartphone debut in 2007. Then the iPhone hit the market and, ever since, Microsoft has been playing catch-up, revamping its mobile operating system and buying the Finnish phone maker Nokia. Its current chief executive, Satya Nadella, is now charged with saving Microsoft\u2019s business from the crush of phones and tablets running non-Microsoft software. The company has done a fine job; its devices are now every bit as good as those of its rivals. But because the company was so late to full-screen smartphones, Microsoft\u2019s app store is seen by developers as a low priority. The lack of apps on the Windows Phone keeps customers away, which further lowers the phone\u2019s reputation with developers. There\u2019s no easy way to win this battle.",

        "name": "Google to Give Start-Ups $100,000 in Cloud Computing Credits ",
        "content": " Google would like to make more money selling data storage on other services on its Google Cloud Platform, and it\u2019s going after it the old-fashioned Internet way: Give stuff away and make it up on volume. On Friday, Google is set to announce a new program in which it will offer start-up companies a $100,000 credit on its Google Cloud Platform, according to  a post on the company\u2019s Google Cloud Platform blog . The effort is the company\u2019s latest effort to take on Amazon Web Services, the leader in so-called cloud services that encompass a range of back-end computing functions. The post said the offer was available through several dozen \u201ctop incubators, accelerators and investors\u201d but it didn\u2019t specify who those top investors might be. It\u2019s also limited to companies that are less than five years old and have less than $500,000 in annual revenue. To most people, the idea of giving away storage to make money on storage sounds kind of crazy. But it\u2019s not, at least not entirely. Google is taking a gamble that start-ups will go to it looking for savings, and then stay as they get bigger \u2014 paying more for services and allowing Google to recoup its investment in them. Much the way growing companies sublease office space instead of building a big headquarters, Google\u2019s Cloud Platform is basically a giant set of computer servers, storage, networking and operational features that app makers need to grow. Google rents these things out, relieving companies of the need to buy and operate many computers. For Google, which probably runs the world\u2019s largest computing system, the business amounts to leasing out the capacity it doesn\u2019t use. Among other things, Google stores large amounts of data and helps companies run data queries like telling a dating app how many messages its amorous customers send to each other. Start-ups that get Google\u2019s $100,000 in credits could use their credits for any of those services. In some ways, Google is paying for what Amazon acquired free when it was pioneering cloud computing: buzz among growing young companies. A.W.S. was then seen as a cheaper way to get computing and data storage, and it attracted many start-ups, along with stealth engineering projects at larger companies. Some of these early businesses, like Dropbox, have become very large, and their success has helped attract larger companies, like Netflix, to Amazon. Google may be trying to get some of the same magic. The company has a history of offering start-ups and web developers access to its products, like Maps, to improve their features and make them more valuable to consumers. By offering the data storage credits, Google may be trying not only for free publicity and to cut off some of Amazon\u2019s new business but also looking for novel ways its cloud can be used. Though Amazon now handles large corporate computing jobs, including work for Apple, it still has time for start-ups. In October, it introduced A.W.S. as a way  for small newcomers to use the Amazon cloud.",

        "name": "Barnes & Noble Revenue Is Off, but Loss Narrows ",
        "content": " Barnes & Noble reported a smaller first-quarter loss on Tuesday thanks to cost-cutting, but the struggling retailer, the country's biggest bookseller, could not stave off a 7 percent decline in sales. It is a challenging moment for Barnes & Noble, the last major national bookstore chain remaining after Borders closed in 2011. Barnes & Noble has struggled to compete in the online retail and e-book market after its Nook e-reader was overwhelmed by more popular devices from Amazon and Apple. For the quarter that ended Aug. 2, the first in its 2015 fiscal year, the company reported revenue of $1.23 billion, down from $1.33 billion in the same period a year ago. It had a net loss of $28.4 million, or 56 cents a share, an improvement over last year's first quarter, when it posted a net loss of $87 million, or $1.56 a share. The loss was in line with analysts' expectations. Earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization grew to $30 million, in contrast to a loss of $9 million a year ago, owing in part to cost cutting at its Nook division. But the Nook losses continue to mount. Revenue at the Nook segment plummeted 54 percent compared with the previous year. Digital content sales fell 24 percent, to $52 million. In an effort to offset the losses from the Nook, Barnes & Noble is spinning off its Nook Media division into a separate business from its retail stores, a move it aims to complete by the end of March 2015. The decision to spin off the Nook unit led to a rise in the company's stock price earlier this year. The company also outsourced the manufacturing of its latest Nook device to Samsung, and released the newest version in late August. The new device sells for $179 and has new features like a camera and Google Play's store. In a conference call with investors and analysts, Barnes & Noble's chief executive, Michael P. Huseby, said the chain was making progress with new school contracts for its college business, which has 705 bookstores at colleges and universities, and with new partnerships and initiatives like its co-branded Samsung device. ''This partnership reduces our expenses and provides a platform to grow content sales,'' he said. Barnes & Noble has been experimenting with ways to expand its retail reach and maintain its footing at a tumultuous moment for the book business, as it faces constant pressure from its biggest competitor, Amazon. In August, Barnes & Noble teamed up with Google to test the market for same-day delivery of books and other products from its brick-and-mortar stores in Los Angeles, New York and the San Francisco Bay Area, taking direct aim at Amazon's delivery service. The company has even ventured recently into print-on-demand services to give its customers instant access to obscure titles, and it is testing Espresso Book machines in three outlets in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The machines allow users to self-publish books or print out a title in minutes. It's unclear whether such efforts will secure the bookseller's future. Barnes & Noble has been shuttering stores around the country, including three more in the most recent quarter. Revenue at its retail arm, which has a base of 658 stores and BN.com, was down 5 percent because of store closings and tepid online sales. Mitchell S. Klipper, the chief executive of the company's retail group, said that the declines at the stores were smaller than expected, and that foot traffic was bolstered in part by demand for movie-tie in editions of books like Veronica Roth's ''Divergent'' and Disney's ''Frozen.'' Sales were also lifted by the continuing dispute between Amazon and Hachette, which has resulted in shipping delays from Amazon on some Hachette titles, Mr. Klipper said. The company is also expecting strong holiday sales for new books from Ken Follett, John Grisham and Bill O'Reilly, he said. While some analysts seemed encouraged by the company's efforts to cut losses, others said the continued drop in revenue was a bad sign. ''If your store sales are perpetually declining, even if it's by a small percentage every year, that doesn't bode well for the future,'' said James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''Unless you see a turnaround for Barnes & Noble, it's hard to imagine how this is anything other than a gradual, slow decline.'' Publishers have been anxiously monitoring the bookseller's health, and many in the publishing industry worry about dwindling shelf space and decreasing visibility for their books. After years of declining print sales, the publishing industry has shown signs of health this year, bolstered in part by the meteoric growth of the young adult market. Total revenue in trade sales grew 6.5 percent in the first quarter of 2014, compared with the previous year, according to the latest figures available from the Association of American Publishers.",

        "name": "Surviving battle with Amazon and then picking a new fight; Q. and A. ",
        "content": " In 2007, Alan Martin was attending Webster University, pursuing a master\u2019s degree in procurement and acquisitions at a campus in Utah, when he realized he was able to sell his used textbooks for about the same price he had paid for them. From this observation came Mr. Martin\u2019s start-up CampusBookRentals. It was based in Syracuse, Utah, and it grew quickly, reaching No. 17 on Inc. magazine\u2019s list of the fastest-growing private companies, with $21 million in revenue in 2011. People took notice, including some of the people supplying Mr. Martin with textbooks. Mr. Martin\u2019s biggest source of textbooks was Amazon \u2014 until it decided to stop supplying him in 2010, which forced Mr. Martin to change course. He continued to rent out textbooks, but he renamed his company Sidewalk and redirected its energy and money into developing software for campus bookstores. The company\u2019s fast growth slowed, but Sidewalk says it made a $2.8 million profit on $40 million in revenue last year. In a conversation that has been condensed and edited, Mr. Martin, 35, talked about how he had survived the fight with Amazon, why he is still at war with much of the publishing industry and why a company created to disrupt the industry now thinks that campus bookstores are the place to be. Q. How did you finance the original business? A. Before the financial collapse, credit cards were still readily available. Me and three friends started to collect credit card offers and submit them. We raised a little over $250,000. Q. How long did it take you to pay off that debt? A. We technically didn\u2019t pay that off until 2011. All the offers came in the spring of 2008, and most were interest-free for a year and then 10 percent. So we weren\u2019t getting destroyed. Q. Where did you get the books to rent out? A. Early on, we were buying books from students on Half.com and Amazon and basically any open marketplace. We built the entire thing on a just-in-time model. We knew every book that we could acquire and the price, but we didn\u2019t place the order until a consumer ordered it. Q. So Amazon and Half.com delivered the books in their own packaging? A. Yes. For two to three years, only 30 percent shipped from our own warehouse. To mitigate confusion, we sent a bright pink return mailer to every customer. Q. Did you have problems being so dependent on third-party suppliers? A. We certainly did. We were competing for the same customer. Some marketplaces turned us off, canceled thousands upon thousands of orders in a really bad way. Q. Who cut you off? A. It was really just Amazon. Q. So you had promised books to students starting courses and suddenly you had no books. What did you tell the students? A. We were totally honest but we never exposed Amazon because they just made a decision that made sense for them. We said we made a really big mistake and we\u2019re sorry, and we offered a very nice coupon to come back to the site. Like 40 percent off. Q. What did you do to make sure it wouldn\u2019t happen again? A. We put real contractual relationships in place with a lot of marketplaces. And we diversified. We had every book in six or seven places. Q. But Amazon is still one of your suppliers. A. Everything is a lot more contractual now. Q. How do you figure out rental prices? A. It\u2019s just a big math formula that says, how long do we think the book will be alive and at what point do we think we want to sell it. And then all we do is say, how much is it going to cost and how many times do we have to rent it to hit our margin over that time? A book lives on average three years. Q. What margin do you look for? A. We\u2019re about a 40 percent gross margin business. That gives us space to consume our costs and be profitable, which we\u2019ve been since 2009. Q. Why did you start working with campus bookstores? A. We saw that bookstores were a phenomenal distribution channel. They were convenient. They had accurate product. The only reason they were losing market share was that they were overpriced. We thought we could drive more value if we tuned the existing machine. When we made the transition from CampusBookRentals to Sidewalk, it was largely because we thought local was good. You can\u2019t walk off the street to Amazon. What do you do for the campus stores? A. First, we offered them rental. We brought in touch-screen kiosks. Students could pick up a book, check out and then walk away with a rented book in hand. Q. Who owns the book? A. The store, initially. The moment the book rents, we own it. We buy it from the store at retail price. Q. What happens to the books when the student is done? A. After the rental, the student just brings it back to the bookstore and never knows that we\u2019re involved. The bookstore makes the decision to keep it and put it back in inventory or send it back to our warehouse. Q. What if the bookstores end up with used books they don\u2019t need? A. Wholesalers have never allowed the parties to talk to each other because it would remove the wholesaler from the equation. So we launched a product called Marketplace that allows bookstores to trade inventory among themselves instead of having to buy from wholesalers or publishers. Marketplace was launched at the end of 2013. In the first six months, over 230 stores signed up and we did $1.5 million in trade. Q. I assume you get a commission? A. We get a 9 percent commission. On average, stores using Marketplace are saving 35 percent over what they would normally pay, and that translates right to the student. Q. Are paper textbooks going away? A. Digital did come to trade, but in textbooks there\u2019s been very little movement. We are deploying technology into as many campuses as we possibly can on the back of physical books. When the time comes, we will flip the relationship from physical to digital distributorship. Q. Could your technology work in other industries? A. We do see this jumping the walls outside campus retail. Our technology ties the stores together \u2014 imagine a bike shop in Utah and one in Northern California. These people aren\u2019t competing with each other; they\u2019re all competing with Amazon or REI or whoever. So why not leverage their strength?",

        "name": "The Post cuts last link to Graham family ",
        "content": " The Washington Post has announced that its publisher, Katharine Weymouth, is stepping down, signaling the end of the Graham family\u2019s connection to the newspaper it owned for 80 years before selling it last year to Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Ms. Weymouth will be succeeded by Frederick J. Ryan Jr., the founding chief executive of Politico and a former Reagan administration official. According to Tuesday\u2019s announcement, he will start Oct. 1. Ms. Weymouth, a granddaughter of Katharine Graham, the longtime Washington Post publisher, was the last major link to the family that had taken on a sitting president during the Watergate scandal and transformed the paper into an American institution. Her uncle, Donald E. Graham, was the chairman of The Post before selling to Mr. Bezos, and it was expected that Mr. Bezos would bring in his own publisher to oversee the paper\u2019s business operations. Since Mr. Bezos paid $250 million for The Post last summer, many had thought he might apply the kind of disruptive and innovative business strategies to the struggling newspaper business that he has demonstrated at Amazon. Under his ownership, the paper has hired dozens of journalists and focused more intently on The Post\u2019s digital enterprise. But Mr. Ryan\u2019s appointment is the first prominent leadership change. Mr. Ryan, 59, helped start Politico in 2007 along with several Washington Post journalists who created a website focused on politics. He also served as chief operating officer of Politico\u2019s parent company, Allbritton Communications. Reaction to his appointment was mixed in Washington, and in media circles. \u2018\u2018He is a very savvy guy, a very competent guy,\u2019\u2019 said Bill Lord, who worked closely with Mr. Ryan as the general manager at WJLA-TV, which was owned until recently by Allbritton. \u2018\u2018He may be running the business end of things, but he is very friendly to journalists.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Ryan used his connections with the Reagan family to help secure Politico\u2019s involvement in presidential primary debates, an important milestone for the new site, said one former Politico staff member. But others who worked closely with him expressed surprise that Mr. Bezos, renowned as an innovative thinker, would appoint a publisher described by many as the quintessential, conventional Washington insider. At Politico, Mr. Ryan obsessed over the details of the annual White House Correspondents Dinner, a celebrity-driven black-tie event attended by the media and politicians, said one former colleague. And he was generally more involved in Allbritton\u2019s TV business than he was with Politico, current and former staff members said. Mr. Ryan stepped down from his roles at Politico and Allbritton last year, shortly after Allbritton sold its TV stations. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan said that he had in fact been very closely involved with Politico and had learned much about both traditional print media and digital operations that he hoped to apply at The Post. And he said he viewed the White House Correspondents Dinner as \u2018\u2018an important event.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Ryan said that he and Mr. Bezos believe that \u2018\u2018shrinking is not going to be the way to success in this very competitive media landscape.\u2019\u2019 The two plan for The Post to continue growing, he said, and will also focus on technology and on \u2018\u2018the reader, and future reader, user and future user\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018how, where, and how often they engage.\u2019\u2019 He hopes to work closely with Mr. Bezos, though \u2018\u2018obviously he does have a day job,\u2019\u2019 he said, referring to Amazon. Mr. Ryan said that he had been appointed after meeting Mr. Bezos through mutual friends. The two had \u2018\u2018a number of conversations about the exciting possibilities in the media, the opportunities for the future,\u2019\u2019 he said, which culminated in his being offered the position. Ms. Weymouth, 48, said that she was leaving the paper with mixed emotions. The decision to step aside now was not Ms. Weymouth\u2019s, though she was not dismissed for poor performance, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In a statement, Mr. Bezos said that Ms. Weymouth \u2018\u2018has successfully led many new initiatives and assured that the first ownership change of this great institution in 80 years has been done smoothly and without skipping a beat.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos and Ms. Weymouth declined requests for interviews. The move is the end of an era in Washington. The Graham family, which bought The Post in 1933, was known for its unbending support for the paper\u2019s journalism and for being the center of a social scene, including the political, media, diplomatic and business elite, that spanned both Washington and New York. In her note to staff members, Ms. Weymouth wrote that it was \u2018\u2018time for new leadership. With Jeff Bezos as our new owner, you are already seeing an infusion of energy and ideas. This is just the beginning of a wonderful new chapter for The Post.\u2019\u2019 According to a securities filing from the Graham Holdings Company, the name the Graham family company took after selling The Post, Ms. Weymouth had been paid about $2.7 million in bonuses related to the performance and the sale of the newspaper in the last year or so. Some current and former Washington Post employees lamented the end of the Grahams\u2019 connection to the paper. \u2018\u2018And now, for my own part, I can say that it took me a long time to comprehend that the Graham era at The Post is finally and fully over,\u2019\u2019 David Maraniss, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter, wrote in an essay at The Columbia Journalism Review on Tuesday. \u2018\u2018The Post under the Grahams was maternal and paternal and uneven and beautifully flawed. But most of all, it was deeply human.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "Amazon's Bet on Content, in a Hub for Gamers ",
        "content": " On Wednesday night, I spent time on Twitch.tv watching people watch people play StarCraft II, Call of Duty and League of Legends. When you cover media, you get used to meta activities, but staring at my computer watching an audience watch others play streaming video games was a new level of remove. There were funny, eccentric grown-ups, but also a lot of teenage boys talking profane smack on headsets, often with corrosive rap spinning in the background, as they maneuvered through seemingly impenetrable game environments. After surfing around for 90 minutes, I couldn't help asking, is this really a thing? Actually, Amazon believes it's a $1.1 billion thing. Last Monday, the company announced it would buy Twitch, which surprised most industry observers because they thought Google had wrapped up a purchase. It surprised me because I had no idea what Twitch was. My demographic hem is showing. I've always taken pride and interest in staying with the wave, swimming in a sea of devices, apps and new business models. But even as video games threaten to become bigger than Hollywood in terms of gross revenue, I've never caught the bug. Maybe if I had had sons instead of daughters, or taken more of an interest in Madden NFL rather than the actual N.F.L., I'd be in the know. I'm not, but I knew what I needed to do. I called Clark. Clark is the 17-year-old son of friends of mine at our summer place. I have spent many hours there chatting with him about his custom-built gaming PC, which, he tells me, includes dual Asus GTX graphics processing units, 16 gigabytes of Crucial Ballistix Sport memory and extra cooling units to keep the beast from overheating while he is busy killing targets. He likes Twitch, of course. ''It's a community, or really a bunch of communities within communities, organized around certain games,'' he said. So ... all these people gather online to listen to people discuss the games they are playing as they play them? ''They don't just talk about the games, they talk about themselves, too,'' he said. ''You learn stuff and you can see their faces, so you can see emotions and what makes them laugh.'' ''It isn't like TV,'' he added. ''In gaming, you are the character, you're the one that that's deciding.'' Twitch has built a platform that hosts live events akin to the N.F.L., the United States Open or the X Games -- and it has the audience to show for it. Part of the magic is that on Twitch, you are not just watching other gamers, but hyper-talented digital warriors, the Peyton Mannings and Roger Federers of Counter-Strike and Minecraft. From a standing start in 2011, Twitch garnered 55 million unique users in July who watched 155 billion minutes of gaming and has become the country's fourth-largest user of Internet bandwidth. Even the gamers on Twitch were surprised how much it was worth. I was watching someone named Sing_sing play Dota 2 -- don't ask, I couldn't tell you -- and he murmured to the people watching, ''$970 million, I don't even understand how that works,'' referring to the cash portion of the purchase price. As he tried to destroy something called the Ancient, he added, ''I guess it's because the numbers keep growing and growing.'' They certainly do. According to The Wall Street Journal, last October, more people -- 32 million -- watched a championship for League of Legends, on various streaming services including Twitch, than saw the finales of ''The Sopranos,'' ''24'' and ''Breaking Bad,'' combined. Amazon's desire to outmaneuver both Google and Yahoo and get its hands on the controller at Twitch probably makes sense. Demographically, it's a bit of a leap -- Amazon's user base looks more like me than the young people on Twitch, but then, that's sort of the point. You have to build your next cohort of customers. And after years of contenting itself as the biggest online retailer of hard goods, Amazon has made its media ambitions clear -- part of its future lies in occupying screens of all sorts. But finding a place in the media hierarchy among the traditional players and digital insurgents like Netflix that have a head start is a long, expensive grind. Just last week, Amazon unveiled a slate of five traditional television pilots with big names attached. But so far, the original programming, created for its Prime subscription service, hasn't caught fire. The economics of Twitch are compelling partly because it supplies its own content and audience, comparable to an oven that produces its own food. But it wouldn't be streaming all that content to giant audiences if it didn't get the technology right. People who marvel at the growth of Netflix would do well to remember that it cracked the code on the technology side of streaming before it ever competed for Emmys. Netflix caught on because the service worked. Similarly, Twitch won in a space where others failed because it got the infrastructure right. Gaming is a bandwidth hog, and Twitch is able to host multiplayer games, large events and commentary because the company invested in at least 15 data centers jammed with servers. If that sounds familiar, keep in mind that Amazon became the dominant online retailer on Earth by using technological might to remove friction and frustration from the buying experience. No one has its hands on more cloud capacity than Amazon, so bolting Twitch into Amazon on the tech side -- it will remain independently run -- will allow it to scale without interruption. Amazon has made its own investments in gaming, but the costly Twitch acquisition -- the second-biggest in its history after the $1.2 billion it paid for Zappos in 2009 -- positions the company in a complicated media future where traditional television series will compete for mindshare with game lords, shopping and makeup stars on YouTube as well as celebrities' Instagram feeds. There is a huge land grab for nontraditional models of programming. DreamWorks Animation bought AwesomenessTV, a popular YouTube channel, last year, and in March, Disney snatched up Maker Studios, a video supplier for YouTube, while Peter Chernin, formerly president of News Corporation, has invested in Crunchyroll, a streaming hub of anime. All of these deals are about content, but they are also a hedge, a way of exploring other production protocols that don't involve prominent stars, agents and expensive producers. Michael Frazzini, vice president for Amazon Games, framed the Twitch purchase in vivid, simple terms in an interview with Time magazine. ''I think it's fairly safe to say at this point that on anything with a screen, games are the No. 1 or 2 activity,'' he said. Amazon sells those screens -- the Kindle, Fire TV and Fire Phone -- and buying Twitch, along with deals with HBO, Nickelodeon and other providers, means that it has the software assets -- in this case, entertainment -- to animate sales of those devices. You need look only at the role of iTunes in the development of iPods and then the iPhone to understand how a ready universe of desirable content can move units. Say what you want about game nerds, there is clear value in owning so much screen time of a hard-to-reach demographic of young men. Even if I don't get gaming, I am beginning to understand the larger game it represents.

        "name": "$1 billion webcaster started as a side deal ",
        "content": " To call Twitch.tv a happy accident would be a grand understatement. The website has quickly emerged as the go-to destination for watching video games, drawing tens of millions of viewers each month. On Monday, that success led to a huge payday for the company\u2019s founders, as Amazon said it had reached a deal to buy Twitch for more than $1 billion. But Twitch was never supposed to exist. The site grew from a small side project started by a handful of start-up engineers into a company that \u2014 as one of the founders described in an interview last week \u2014 happened to land at the right place at the right time. \u2018\u2018It became the tail that wagged the dog,\u2019\u2019 Emmett Shear, one of Twitch\u2019s founders, said in the interview. \u2018\u2018It ended up taking over our whole company.\u2019\u2019 In 2006, Mr. Shear and Justin Kan had a question: What would happen if they wore cameras 24 hours a day and broadcast their lives to the web? That curiosity led them to create Justin.tv, and Mr. Kan became the star, \u2018\u2018lifecasting\u2019\u2019 his daily activities for anyone to see. Regular users were invited to do the same. But Mr. Kan and Mr. Shear quickly noticed that most of Justin.tv\u2019s success came from video game players who used the site to stream themselves playing. In 2011, the group decided to create a separate company, introducing Twitch \u2014 a new, entirely gaming-focused version of the site \u2014 at the E3 gaming exposition in California. \u2018\u2018It became clear that it was its own beast,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Shear said. The company said on Tuesday that Mr. Shear was not available to discuss the company\u2019s plans, now that it will be owned by Amazon. But one thing is clear: Twitch is a huge business, a hot spot for people to watch and chat about what has essentially become online gaming as spectator sport, one played not with shoulder pads and helmets, but with ergonomic keyboards and screen-mounted webcams. The site has many similarities to YouTube, the reigning king of online video. As on YouTube, people host their own individual video channels. Anyone can start a channel, and most anyone can watch others\u2019 channels. But unlike YouTube, Twitch\u2019s focus is on games and especially on live-streaming video, not recorded video. People with a channel on Twitch host live video sessions of the games they are playing \u2014 whether short, first-person shoot-\u2019em-up battles or lengthy group quests in role-playing games like World of Warcraft. Broadcasters often converse with their followers in a dedicated chat room. Popular streamers can amass thousands of followers; the most popular streamers have fans that number in the millions. In part, Mr. Shear said, Twitch\u2019s surge in popularity is the result of technological changes beyond the company\u2019s control. Live-streamed video is only as good as the Internet network it runs on. And until recent years, the broadband backbone in the United States struggled to handle the heavy traffic that live streaming demands. \u2018\u2018This couldn\u2019t have existed five years before we launched it,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Shear said. \u2018\u2018You needed high-resolution video. You needed broadband Internet, which just wasn\u2019t there.\u2019\u2019 South Korea, by comparison, has had more robust Internet networks than the United States for years. When the service was becoming popular with gamers, United States broadband speeds were a fraction of those in South Korea, according to a 2010 report from Akamai, an Internet content delivery network. High-speed access was also more expensive in the United States than in South Korea, according to Akamai. It is perhaps no surprise, then, that South Korea has been the leader in live-streamed gaming, hosting major tournaments in which gamers compete against one another in front of millions of online viewers for big prizes. But now in the United States and elsewhere, Mr. Shear said, \u2018\u2018Internet access is just getting cheaper and cheaper, faster and faster.\u2019\u2019 The speed has helped Twitch generate 55 million regular visitors from around the world each month, and those people watch 16 billion minutes of its videos. More than 1.1 million people broadcast their gaming activity to the service. (In the meantime, Justin.tv operations were wound down completely this month.) Along with the advancement of technology, Twitch largely credits its success to its robust network of engaged members. In essence, the company has turned into a cluster of ad hoc social networks, a place to chat about anything from the game on the screen to what people had for breakfast that morning. \u2018\u2018Every channel is its own microcommunity, where everyone gets to know each other over their shared interests,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Shear said. Tessa Brook, a 30-year-old woman who goes by the name Tessachka on Twitch, posts her regular online gaming schedule \u2014 about 42 hours a week \u2014 so her 5,000 followers know when they can watch her play. \u2018\u2018I think Twitch was born out of a simple need to share game experiences,\u2019\u2019 said Brian Blau, a technology analyst at Gartner Research. Twitch is not a traditional social media company, like Facebook, he said, but the site\u2019s social aspect is at its core. \u2018\u2018Twitch connects gamers together with social-like features, and that creates a community.\u2019\u2019 For Ms. Brook and popular streamers like her, gaming can also be lucrative. Popular players who are selected for Twitch\u2019s partner program earn a cut of the revenue from advertisements that run on their channel. Streamers can also accept monetary donations of $1 or more from viewers. Mr. Shear said the next generation of Twitch gamers could be players of more casual games, like those popular on smartphones. Clash of Clans, for example, one of the most popular smartphone games, is becoming particularly popular to stream, he said. But Mr. Shear said the company was focused on more than smartphones. He said the company would also most likely pursue international expansion, especially in fast-growing regions like South America. \u2018\u2018Mobile is going up, adoption of every new generation of gaming console is going up, and there\u2019s more money being spent on PC gaming than ever before,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Shear said. \u2018\u2018Gaming, as a whole, is growing.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " Related:  Drone Developers Consider Obstacles That Cannot Be Flown Around Amazon, it seems, is not the only big technology company dreaming of a drone delivery service. After two years of stealth research, Google on Thursday lifted the veil on an experimental program to deliver goods with tiny unmanned, or \u201cdrone,\u201d aircraft that are a cross between a plane and a helicopter, according to Google. The project was detailed in a  lengthy Atlantic story. If the idea sounds familiar, that\u2019s because online retailer Amazon announced an experimental program last year that  would also deliver goods through the air . The program, which Google is calling \u201cProject Wing,\u201d was led for two years by  Nicholas Roy , an M.I.T. professor who took a sabbatical for the project. According to The Atlantic, Google now has dozens of people on Project Wing. They\u2019re working on improving the technology, and may create a drone delivery app. The Internet giant is also aggressively working on other kinds of robotics, most notably self-driving cars. The Federal Aviation Administration has so far not been keen on the drone delivery concept. Earlier this year, it blocked an aerial delivery service proposed by a local brewery in Minnesota for ferrying beer to ice fishermen who didn\u2019t want to come in from the cold. A Google spokeswoman said the company has briefed the F.A.A. on its hopes for a fleet of baby helicopters, which would not be built for at least a few years. In terms of how the actual delivery would be handled, Google said it tried the parachute approach (like in The Hunger Games), as well as shooting the package downward like a missile. They also tried landing it, but that was problematic because Google believed people might get too close to the vehicle and lose a finger to the drone\u2019s rotors while trying to fetch their delivery. In the end, they settled on a kind of fishing line that lowers the payload to customers from an airborne drone about 150 feet above the ground, as Google demonstrates with a package of dog food in  this video .",

        "name": "What\u2019s Twitch? Millions of gamers know; Amazon\u2019s new purchase is a start-up that turned gaming into a mass event ",
        "content": " Video games have long been something people played. But in the last few years, thanks in part to fast Internet access and multiplayer games, the games have become something that people sit back and watch, too. On Monday, that new habit enticed the web giant Amazon to reach a $1.1 billion deal to buy Twitch, the most popular website for watching people play games. The deal for Twitch is the latest sign of the way forms of behavior once seemingly on the fringe can, in the hands of tech entrepreneurs, turn into huge online communities in no time. Twitch did not exist a little over three years ago, and it now has 55 million unique viewers a month globally, helping turn games into a spectator event as much as a participatory activity. Those millions of eyeballs are valuable to web companies, and Amazon, although usually known for its retailing, is no exception. To win in its bid for Twitch, Amazon had to outmaneuver a who\u2019s who of the technology world, including Google \u2014 strongly suggesting that these companies think the era of video-game viewing is just starting. It also underscored Amazon\u2019s growing appetite for controlling and delivering content to digital devices, especially the tablets and smartphones made by Amazon. \u2018\u2018Broadcasting and watching gameplay is a global phenomenon,\u2019\u2019 Jeffrey R. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, said in a statement, \u2018\u2018and Twitch has built a platform that brings together tens of millions of people who watch billions of minutes of games each month.\u2019\u2019 Twitch specializes in live videos of people playing games, including regular Joes blasting away in Call of Duty, a popular shooting game, and elite players who earn million-dollar payouts at professional game tournaments. Twitch viewers typically see the screen of a broadcaster, featuring the game being played, along with a video feed of the player\u2019s face and a chat window so they can communicate with the player and others watching the action. The site has attracted enough viewers to put it among 15 most-trafficked websites around the world, according to data compiled by Sandvine, an Internet networking company. Twitch viewers flock to the site to improve their gaming skills by watching people who have mastered a game or just to get a closer look at games before buying them. Some of the biggest followings on Twitch are of people who are simply amusing, rather than the best players. Gamers can transmit games over Twitch by using PCs along with consoles like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Twitch says that people watch more than 16 billion minutes of its videos each month. More than 1.1 million unique broadcasters use Twitch to stream video. The company shares advertising revenue with people who broadcast over its service. While the audiences for many broadcasters are so small that they make little money, some broadcasters are said to earn over six figures a year. The service has dovetailed with the rise of e-sports, as professional gaming is often called. Twitch broadcasts the action from live tournaments for big games like League of Legends and Dota 2. Professional gamers also use Twitch to let spectators watch their practices, inviting them to ask questions about playing techniques. \u2018\u2018Before Twitch, gaming was something you did in the basement in the glow of your monitor,\u2019\u2019 said David Cowan, a venture capitalist with Bessemer Venture Partners, a big investor in Twitch. \u2018\u2018Now it\u2019s something you can do in groups with hundreds and thousands of people.\u2019\u2019 It is not clear exactly how Amazon intends to fit Twitch into its eclectic and ever-expanding portfolio of businesses. It could help accelerate the company\u2019s advertising ambitions by giving it a huge video network to pump commercials through. This year, Amazon ad revenue is expected to jump 40 percent, to over $1 billion, according to estimates from eMarketer, a technology research firm. Amazon plans to let Twitch operate independently, out of its offices in San Francisco, according to Emmett Shear, Twitch\u2019s chief executive. The deal includes stock Amazon is paying to retain Twitch employees and $970 million in cash, said a person briefed on the terms of the deal. For months, Amazon has been in a nasty public feud with the Hachette Book Group over the pricing of that publisher\u2019s e-books, showing just how important unfettered access to digital content is to the company\u2019s ambitions. Amazon has started to invest heavily in developing original television shows and movies, and even to develop games of its own, all of them accessible to a growing array of devices, including an Amazon smartphone, television set-top box and tablets. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re heavily invested in games already,\u2019\u2019 Mike Frazzini, vice president for Amazon games, said in an interview. \u2018\u2018We have a healthy business selling games to customers.\u2019\u2019 James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said the Hachette dispute had shown that Amazon needed to invest more in content that it can control. \u2018\u2018It puts them into a vulnerable position where they need to make sure they have hours and hours of stuff to pump into these devices,\u2019\u2019 Mr. McQuivey said. But Amazon could also face pricing disputes with game publishers, since Twitch has agreements with major game makers that allow it to broadcast content from their games. Some publishers, though, are interested in more lucrative deals with Twitch than the ones they have now. One such publisher, Activision Blizzard, which owns the games Hearthstone and Call of Duty, is unlikely to continue its current business arrangement with Twitch, according to a person briefed on the company\u2019s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. Twitch \u2018\u2018loves Blizzard\u2019s games,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Shear said, and the company wants to help Blizzard make more money from the site. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a huge marketing value for them,\u2019\u2019 he said. Mr. Shear said that the site also provided a community meeting place \u2014 recalling an old ritual, when gamers would crowd one another in arcades. \u2018\u2018What Twitch supports isn\u2019t even new \u2014 it\u2019s old,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018But what\u2019s new, that showed up in the past few years, is the entire online community can participate en masse in this kind of full interactive experience.\u2019\u2019",

Google wouldn\u2019t say how much it paid for Zync. The company will integrate Zync\u2019s data and technology into the Google Cloud Platform, and move off Amazon Web Services. Cloud computing is the term technology people use to describe  systems of networked computers   that work really efficiently and have ripped costs out of data storage. Cloud networks \u2014 the biggest being Amazon\u2019s Amazon Web Services and Google\u2019s Cloud Platform \u2014 help companies grow quickly because instead of having to buy a million computers to host their data, companies can just rent them from giants like Amazon and Google. Google has been beefing up its Cloud Platform recently,  buying Stackdriver,   a maker of cloud-monitoring software, in May. And while the Google Cloud Platform already had rendering services, Zync, which was spun out of the visual effects studio ZERO VFX, has deep ties to the movie industry. Industry watchers expect Google to continue adding technological bells and whistles to its Cloud Platform \u2014 including through acquisitions \u2014 in a bid to get more customers and industries to rent space on its cloud. [Video: A promotional video for Zync.  Watch on YouTube. ] Cloud computing has allowed the lightning fast growth of services like Pinterest, the photo sharing company, by drastically reducing the cost of data storage. The same is true of visual effects. In the past, studios that wanted to go nuts with special effects had to buy lots of computers and stuff them in temperature-controlled closets, using them when they needed them but not really anytime else. Zync\u2019s rendering system helps smaller studios get in the game by allowing them to rent server space by the hour (and obviously, big studios also like to save money). With Google\u2019s financial might, it\u2019s a decent bet that the cost of special effects will only continue to fall. In a statement on its Cloud Platform blog, Google said: \u201cTogether Zync + Cloud Platform will offer studios the rendering performance and capacity they need, while helping them manage costs. For example, with per-minute billing studios aren\u2019t trapped into paying for unused capacity when their rendering needs don\u2019t fit in perfect hour increments.\u201d",

But in the last few years, thanks in part to fast Internet access and multiplayer games, the games have become something that people sit back and watch, too. On Monday, that new habit enticed the web giant Amazon to reach a $1.1 billion deal to buy Twitch, the most popular website for watching people play games. The deal for Twitch is the latest sign of the way forms of behavior once seemingly on the fringe can, in the hands of tech entrepreneurs, turn into huge online communities in no time. Twitch did not exist a little over three years ago, and it now has 55 million unique viewers a month globally, helping turn games into a spectator event as much as a participatory activity. Those millions of eyeballs are valuable to web companies, and Amazon, although usually known for its retailing, is no exception. To win in its bid for Twitch, Amazon had to outmaneuver a who\u2019s who of the tech world, including Google \u2014 strongly suggesting that these companies think the era of video-game viewing is just starting. It also underscored Amazon\u2019s growing appetite for controlling and delivering content to digital devices, especially the tablets and smartphones made by Amazon.  Read more \u00bb",

        "name": "Customizing data storage so it\u2019s worth paying for; With tech giants pushing them out, start-ups offer industry-specific services ",
        "content": " Nothing concentrates minds at a tech start-up like living in the middle of a price war between Amazon and Google. Just ask executives at companies like Box, Dropbox and Hightail. They pioneered a new kind of Internet service that allows people and companies to store all kinds of electronic files in an easy-to-use online locker. But as often happens, the much bigger companies liked the idea so much they decided to do the same thing \u2014 at a much lower price. \u2018\u2018These guys will drive prices to zero,\u2019\u2019 said Aaron Levie, co-founder and chief executive of Box. \u2018\u2018You do not want to wait for Google or Amazon to keep cutting prices on you. \u2018Free\u2019 is not a business model.\u2019\u2019 So how do you avoid free? Box is trying to cater to special data storage needs, like digital versions of X-rays for health care companies and other tasks specific to different kinds of customers. Hightail is trying to do something similar for customers like law firms. And Dropbox? It is trying to make sure that its consumer-centric service stays easier to use than what the big guys provide. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s very tough just to be in the storage business,\u2019\u2019 said Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive of Hightail. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t think that is what we\u2019re selling anymore.\u2019\u2019 In the technology industry, they call this sort of reinvention of the core business model a \u2018\u2018pivot.\u2019\u2019 Another way to describe it is a fight for survival. Box, founded in 2005, has attracted $512 million in investment, and in March it filed papers for an initial public offering of stock. In July, the company said it had 39,000 businesses signed up, paying from $15 to $35 a month per user. It is hard to know how many people that is, since some of the businesses have just a couple of people, and others include General Electric and Eli Lilly. Dropbox has 300 million customers worldwide and actually runs inside Amazon Web Services, as do parts of Box. Many Dropbox customers pay nothing and get two gigabytes of storage capacity a month, the equivalent of 1,000 books or seven minutes of high-definition television. A version for $10 a month offers 100 gigabytes. Hightail, which used to be called YouSendIt, says it has over a half-million business customers paying $25 a month or more, depending on the features chosen. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a place for all of them,\u2019\u2019 said Amita Potnis, an analyst at IDC. \u2018\u2018Amazon\u2019s focus is really computing itself. The smaller ones have to focus on ways businesses actually use it.\u2019\u2019 For example, she said, the services can help companies collaborate with each other online instead of sending emails back and forth with attachments. While devices and apps get most of the attention, data storage is every bit as important, particularly as objects like phones, tablets, cars and thermostats become appendages of the Internet. Throw in trends like collaboration and big data analysis, and all those bits of data become more dynamic than something in a file cabinet. It is fluid and being entered from many points. Managing all that data should be a good business. The problem for everyone is price. Google and Amazon have for years decimated competition in their respective fields of Internet advertising and retailing. As the two companies move to dominate cloud computing, including online storage, they are turning that relentlessness on each other. In March, Google celebrated the unification of several cloud computing services with price cuts of 68 percent for most customers, to 2.6 cents a gigabyte a month, about one-quarter the price of Dropbox\u2019s premium consumer service. Amazon Web Services, which had cut prices at least four times since 2008, responded with cuts of its own, including one to 2.75 cents a gigabyte for large amounts of storage, and just a penny a month for data used less frequently. It has made further price cuts on other types of storage since then. Many expect Microsoft, which runs its own big cloud business, called Azure, to follow with similar cuts. Even by the standards of computing, where services seem almost invariably to become cheaper and faster, storage prices have had an exceptional fall. The first gigabyte storage device in 1980 typically cost $120,000 and weighed 550 pounds. Amazon\u2019s cloud-based storage might cost 12 cents a year. None of the smaller online storage companies doubt that Amazon and Google can make seemingly impossible pricing moves. Both companies also have a scale that means even the tiniest profit can be huge. A.W.S. says that almost all of Netflix, and Amazon itself, is inside its cloud, along with hundreds of other substantial companies. Apple\u2019s iCloud storage service and other parts of Apple, along with operations at several large banks, run inside A.W.S., say individuals familiar with the service who asked not to be identified by name so they could sustain relations with the powerful cloud company. Amazon would not comment on confidential customer agreements. An Apple spokesman noted that Apple had its own data centers in four locations in the United States and said \u2018\u2018the vast majority\u2019\u2019 of data in services like iTunes, maps and the App Store runs on Apple\u2019s computers. Apple uses other facilities as well, he said. Google does not have anything like the Amazon customer list, but its computer network is probably the largest corporate network in the world. It includes custom-made computing and power systems and several thousand engineers to keep it running. According to one person knowledgeable about the system, Google spends about $2 billion a quarter on its computing infrastructure. Google would not comment on its costs. In an email, Tom Kershaw, a product manager for Google\u2019s cloud service, predicted more cost cutting. \u2018\u2018As more customers store more information, for longer, we\u2019re able to make gains in efficiency and pass these savings along to the customer.\u2019\u2019 Both Box and Hightail now say they assume that they will offer customers unlimited storage free and push their costs into the prices they charge for other services. \u2018\u2018At this point, it\u2019s better just to say \u2018unlimited,\u2019\u2019\u2019 Mr. Levie said. \u2018\u2018The thing to do is take into account why someone is storing something online and what their needs are.\u2019\u2019 Box has hired people with specialties in health care, media and entertainment, hospitality and retailing. Dropbox still has supposed limits on storage in its business offering, but they start at a terabyte, or 1,000 gigabytes, and customers can upgrade from there with seemingly no fee. This niche approach could work, provided the big companies do not go after these industry-specific storage markets or build more consumer-friendly service offerings. Mr. Levie said he thought that was unlikely. \u2018\u2018No one is going to build Google Health Care,\u2019\u2019 he said. Mr. Kershaw of Google differed. \u2018\u2018Industry-specific solutions are the wave of the future and a key part of what Google is building for our customers,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

        "name": "German Authors Join Protest Over Amazon's Tactics in E-Book Dispute ",
        "content": " BERLIN -- Taking a page from their colleagues across the Atlantic, more than 1,000 writers from Germany, Austria and Switzerland have united to vent their frustration over the tactics Amazon is using against the Bonnier Group and the authors who are published under its name. The writers, supported by several hundred artists and readers, have signed an open letter to Amazon, the online retailing giant, accusing it of manipulating its recommended reading lists and lying to customers about the availability of books as retaliation in a dispute over e-book prices. ''Amazon's customers have, until now, had the impression that these lists are not manipulated and they could trust Amazon. Apparently that is not the case,'' read the letter, which was to be sent to Amazon and was to appear in leading publications in Austria, Germany and Switzerland on Monday. ''Amazon manipulates recommendation lists. Amazon uses authors and their books as a bargaining chip to exact deeper discounts.'' Signed by leading German-language authors like Elfriede Jelinek, a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2004, and the popular crime novelists Ingrid Noll and Nele Neuhaus, the letter accused Amazon of taking longer to deliver books published by Bonnier, making false statements about whether the books were available and pulling the authors of those books from recommended reading lists. ''Unfortunately, the American company refuses to accept our traditional cultural values, because it only thinks in purely economic terms,'' Ms. Noll said. ''We have to stand together and defend our values.'' Amazon's dispute with Bonnier, based in Sweden, over e-book prices echoes a continuing fight between Amazon and the publisher Hachette in the United States. But unlike in Amazon's dispute with Hachette, which has attracted comments by late-night television hosts and rants on social media, German authors have largely kept silent at the urging of publishers, many of whom did not wish to complicate already strained negotiations. The decision to publish the letter was made weeks before the annual book fair in Frankfurt, which starts a new season of price negotiations. Gerhard Ruiss, of the IG Authors Austrian, the Interest Group of Austrian Authors, which also signed the open letter, said the action was only the first step to raise readers' awareness about the issue. Other steps will include discussions and demonstrations at the fair, which takes place in October. In response to the authors' complaint, Amazon pointed at publishers, contending that their terms were unfair. Bonnier ''offers most of its titles under conditions that make it significantly more expensive for us to sell a digital version, as compared to a printed edition,'' Amazon said by email. ''E-books can and should be offered cheaper than printed books, and this should also go for the prices at which booksellers buy from publishers.'' The authors released a digital version of the letter on Friday, posting it at a site created for the protest, fairer-buchmarkt.de. By late Saturday, more than 1,000 authors had signed, said Nina George, one of the organizers. Ms. George said the organizers rushed to put up the site after some German publications leaked the story, resulting in an overwhelming response. Regula Venske, secretary general of the German chapter of PEN International, an association of writers, helped spread the word. ''We wanted to give it enough time for more authors to voice their support, but it has taken on a life of its own,'' she said. Many points included in the German letter echoed those raised by more than 900 writers in the United States as part of Authors United, such as encouraging readers to write directly to Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive and founder. The German-language authors also suggested sending a note to Ralf Kleber, head of Amazon Germany, to urge the retailer to ''stop using books and authors as hostages and instead ensure a lively and honest book culture.'' The literary culture in Germany and Austria differs profoundly from that in the United States or Britain, in that pricing is protected by laws that forbid deep discounting, or other purely commercial practices. Many authors fear Amazon will use its dominant position to seek to overturn these laws. Mr. Ruiss said authors and publishers in Austria had long been uneasy with the methods Amazon uses to gain customers. The most recent dispute over e-book pricing has only exacerbated a strained relationship. ''We have had difficulties with Amazon like with no other retailer,'' Mr. Ruiss said. ''From the beginning, they have always demanded special conditions that squeezed the publishers.'' Unlike the situation in the American market, which is dominated by the big five publishing houses -- HarperCollins, Penguin Random House, MacMillan, Hachette and Simon & Schuster -- the legal protection of book prices in many German-speaking countries means that many smaller, specialty and boutique publishers continue to thrive. That diversity is reflected in the 1,001 signatories, which include first-time authors, writers of best sellers, science writers, poets and even some writers who publish directly through Amazon's electronic publishing platforms. Ms. George, a novelist and columnist, said that when she read the letter from the American authors she decided that German authors needed to take similar action. She and three other writers organized a German letter under the banner, ''Authors for a Fair Book Market.'' She emphasized the neutral approach by the group, which does not aim to attack Amazon, but seeks to raise awareness of the effect of the price wars on authors, many of whom fear a loss of Germany's special protections if books become simply a commodity. ''We are not against Amazon, but for a fair book market, which means that Amazon is not our main enemy, but their methods are really bad and unfair,'' Ms. George said. The German Publishers and Booksellers Association submitted a complaint to the German antitrust authority in June, claiming that Amazon's monopolylike position in the e-book market violates competition law. The European Commission has opened a preliminary investigation into the complaint, the association said. In the meantime, Amazon has continued to expand within Germany, its largest market outside the United States. The company plans to open two logistics centers across the border in Poland next month, stoking fears that it will later force distributors to deliver books to the Polish centers, only to have them sent back to customers in Germany. Such moves do little to calm German anxiety over Amazon's unbridled position in the domestic book market. Alexander Skipis, president of the publishers' association, said he hoped the letter would increase awareness of what was at stake. ''It shows the public and politicians around the world that this is about more than a dispute over price conditions,'' Mr. Skipis said of the letter. ''This is about maintaining a book culture that requires a certain protection and cannot be regarded from a purely commercial point of view.''

        "content": " The exact nature of the conflict between Amazon and Hachette is somewhat veiled. The parties confirm that it is over e-book prices, and Amazon obviously wants more money from the sale of e-books than Hachette is willing to give. But Hachette has been circumspect, while Amazon has been forceful  if not always accurate   . So here, in the interests of further enlightenment, here are a few commentators on the dispute who are worth reading. If they have one thing in common, it\u2019s a feeling that neither side is their best friend or, for that matter, the reader\u2019s friend. John Scalzi   , a novelist who regularly has interesting things to say about Amazon,  writes   : \u201cWhat it\u2019s about is two large corporations \u2014 Amazon and Hachette \u2014 arguing about whose business needs are more important. Hachette wants to continue to price new-release eBooks above $9.99 so it can continue to make what it considers an acceptable amount of profit on new releases and then lower the price point as the new release matures, capturing other audiences as it goes. Amazon wants to nail the price at $9.99 because it\u2019s in the business of selling everything to everyone, and price control is a fine way of locking the consumer into its business ecosystem.\u201d Chuck Wendig   is certainly the funniest writer about Amazon/Hachette, admittedly not a category with many contenders. Wendig, whose books are published by Amazon\u2019s Kindle Direct Publishing, is hard to quote briefly, but  one recent post   has the headline \u201cIn Which Amazon Calls on You to Defend the Realm\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure \u2014 though it may be a hallucination! \u2014 that last night Amazon wrote me, a KDP author-publisher, to get me to\u2026 I think ding-dong-ditch Hachette? Maybe prank phone call them? Pull down Hachette authors\u2019 pants? Give them a swirly?\u201d His piece on the central conflict here \u2014 the price of e-books \u2014 is also worth checking out. First he quotes an Amazon statement: \u201cKeep in mind that books don\u2019t just compete against books. Books compete against mobile games, television, movies, Facebook, blogs, free news sites and more. If we want a healthy reading culture, we have to work hard to be sure books actually are competitive against these other media types, and a big part of that is working hard to make books less expensive.\u201d Then  he analyzes the statement   : \u201cBooks are not other things, so how do you compare? Facebook is free, so should books be free? I can kill two hours on Facebook easy, just by tripping and falling into a rage-hole. Oh, but wait, a Blu-Ray or digital download of a new movie probably $19.99, bare minimum, and that\u2019s only two hours long. A book will last you more than that so \u2026 should the book be $19.99? Or maybe a little less, in order to compete? $14.99, maybe. It\u2019s an odd point to make and does little to enforce the argument that e-books should be cheaper just as it would be a bad argument in terms of demanding e-books be more expensive. It\u2019d be like saying ice cream should be cheaper because soup is cheaper.\u201d Jake Kerr,  , a science fiction writer, argues that Amazon is acting the way it is   not because it is a big bad monopoly, which is what some of its opponents say, but because its position with e-books is so fragile. Apple, Google and Microsoft will all aggressively try to compete with Amazon on e-books if they think it is worth their while, Mr. Kerr says. So Amazon has a difficult balancing act: warding off other tech companies by making the e-book business so low margin as to be not worth pursuing, while simultaneously not drowning in losses itself. In this analysis, Amazon has been good for e-book publishers and authors. They benefit from the aggressive discounting \u2014 selling more while Amazon takes the hit on margins. If the retailer succeeds in lowering the price of e-books while getting a bigger cut, Mr. Kerr writes, it can shore up its own margins while reducing the gross revenue in the market. That might keep out Apple and the others. It also might help the consumer, even if the real point is corporate preservation. Mr. Kerr concludes that \u201cthe one thing that Amazon can do that will substantively hurt Hachette is to stop discounting their books.\u201d Late last week, as it happens, Hachette authors started complaining that the minimal discounts on their books were vanishing entirely.",

        "content": " CORRECTION APPENDEDThe king of online retail is flexing its muscle to win over Mom and Pop. Amazon, the online retail giant, on Wednesday announced its own take on a credit card reader, pushing the company into the crowded and complicated world of mobile payments. Already, many companies are elbowing one another to win the trust -- and millions of business transactions -- of small and medium retailers the world over. The new product, Amazon Local Register, is a black, compact rectangular card reader stamped with Amazon's logo across the front. The $10 device plugs into a merchant's smartphone or tablet, and works in conjunction with a smartphone app to process and track all of a merchant's business transactions. It also comes with an enticing offer: lower processing fees. The device is a new stomping ground for Amazon, which has expanded its online storefront over the years to include goods of nearly all sorts -- books, furniture and electronics, to name a few. While many of the products on Amazon.com are sold directly by Amazon, which is based in Seattle, the site also lists products sold and shipped by smaller retailers. And that, some analysts say, is why this move was not entirely unexpected. ''So much of this is about Amazon building platform lock-in,'' said Heath Terry, an Internet analyst with Goldman Sachs, who said the Local Register card reader was just one more component filling out an entire suite of offerings for the small businesses that sell goods on Amazon.com. ''If you're a third-party seller on Amazon's site that's using them for one thing, ultimately you're using Amazon for everything,'' Mr. Terry said. This should all sound familiar. Square, the San Francisco payments start-up valued at $5 billion, has offered its sleek version of a mobile card reader since 2010. PayPal, eBay's payments division, which processed $55 billion in transactions last quarter, offers a similar device. And then there are the huge incumbents like Verifone, which has sold its own terminals to merchants of all sizes for decades. So by most measures, Amazon is late to the game. And yet no company with a mobile card reader has emerged as a clear winner. Amazon could push its way into the market with its own set of attractive incentives for small businesses. For instance, Amazon is offering early adopters an especially low processing fee on each credit card swipe processed. If a merchant signs up before the end of October, each swipe will cost 1.75 percent of the total transaction, a deal that will last until the end of 2015. That is a full percentage point below Square's cut, which is 2.75 percent per swipe, and less than PayPal's 2.7 percent charge as well. Even after the promotional deal expires, Amazon will charge merchants 2.5 percent. This is classic Amazon. With its low rate, the company is most likely losing money on transactions it processes, according to Colin Sebastian, an Internet analyst with Baird Equity Research. ''In typical Amazon fashion, they're using price as a motivator,'' Mr. Sebastian said. ''It's pretty obvious in this case that they're losing money on the swipes at least.'' That is similar to the company's strategy with Kindle Fire tablets and smartphones; while Amazon makes little to no money on selling the Fire devices, each one acts as a portal to Amazon's retail universe, where customers are encouraged to spend more money buying goods online. But a better rate does not necessarily guarantee it success. As competition has increased, payments companies have expanded the scope of their services, aiming to attract merchants with more than just a lower transaction cut on credit card swipes. Both Square and PayPal, for instance, offer lending programs for merchants looking to expand their operations. This week, Square started an appointment scheduling service for businesses. And this month, Square acquired Caviar, a start-up that provides food delivery service to small restaurants that do not otherwise offer it. ''We've long been focused on building a complete register service for local businesses,'' a Square representative said in a statement. ''This reinforces our mission and shows the demand for all of our services.'' Some businesses may be reticent to sign up for Amazon's new reader, lest they hand over scores of information to the online retailer. Packaged with its new card reader, Amazon's Local Register software will manage detailed data on a merchant's overall business operations, including sales trends and volume. That is the kind of data set that could help Amazon operate more successfully in the long run. ''That's always the threat of doing business with Amazon,'' Mr. Terry said. ''If I'm really successful selling on Amazon, there's a pretty good chance that one day they'll end up competing with me.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. Correction: August 15, 2014, Friday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about Amazon's introduction of a credit card reader referred incorrectly to an Internet analyst who commented on the company's pricing strategy. It was Colin Sebastian, an analyst with Baird Equity Research -- not ''Mr. Baird'' -- who said: ''In typical Amazon fashion, they're using price as a motivator. It's pretty obvious in this case that they're losing money on the swipes at least.''

        "name": "In its fight with authors, Amazon cites Orwell but misses his meaning ",
        "content": " Amazon must be spooked by the idea of writers massing against it, because over the weekend it launched its own counterrevolutionary force. The retailer created a group called Readers United to pressure Hachette, the fourth-biggest book publisher in the United States, in its dispute with Amazon over the price of e-books. The group is a response to Authors United, created by the novelist Douglas Preston to persuade Amazon to stop withholding books from sale when it negotiates with publishers. The confrontation is, some people in publishing argue, a struggle over the future of reading in our time \u2014 or at least the future of Amazon and the big New York publishers, starting with Hachette. Authors United ran an advertisement in The New York Times on Sunday, supplying readers with the email address of Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos. Amazon\u2019s plan for action mimicked Mr. Preston\u2019s. In a web posting and a letter sent out to its Kindle authors, Amazon asked people to write to Hachette\u2019s chief executive, Michael Pietsch, and provided an email address. Just to make sure the letter writers stayed on message, Amazon offered a list of talking points. The first one, alluding to the 2012 Justice Department antitrust suit against Hachette, was, \u2018\u2018We have noted your illegal collusion,\u2019\u2019 always an icebreaker in these circumstances. Amazon then repeated its argument that e-books should be less expensive and charged those who think otherwise with trying to thwart history. And it provided a list of recommended reading, most of which was written by people published by Amazon. Hachette declined to say how many emails Mr. Pietsch was receiving but said he would be replying to all of them with a letter of his own. The letter, which was released to the news media, said more than 80 percent of the publisher\u2019s e-books were $9.99 or less. \u2018\u2018This dispute started because Amazon is seeking a lot more profit and even more market share, at the expense of authors, bricks and mortar bookstores, and ourselves,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Pietsch wrote. Amazon declined to say how many emails Mr. Bezos was receiving. Writers who wrote him said they received no immediate reply. The freshest part of Amazon\u2019s call to arms was the history lesson. It recounted how the book industry hated mass-market paperbacks when they were introduced in the 1930s and said they would ruin the business when they really rejuvenated it. Unfortunately, to clinch its argument, it cited the wrong authority: \u2018\u2018The famous author George Orwell came out publicly and said about the new paperback format, if \u2018publishers had any sense, they would combine against them and suppress them.\u2019 Yes, George Orwell was suggesting collusion.\u2019\u2019 This perceived slur on the memory of one of the 20th century\u2019s most revered truth-tellers might prove to be one of Amazon\u2019s biggest public relations blunders since it deleted copies of \u2018\u20181984\u2019\u2019 from readers\u2019 Kindles in 2009. A moment\u2019s web searching would have revealed to the Amazon Books Team, which is credited as the source of the Hachette post, that it was wildly misrepresenting the intent of this \u2018\u2018famous author.\u2019\u2019 When Orwell wrote that line, he was celebrating paperbacks published by Penguin, not urging suppression or collusion. Here is what the writer actually said in The New English Weekly on March 5, 1936: \u2018\u2018The Penguin Books are splendid value for sixpence, so splendid that if the other publishers had any sense they would combine against them and suppress them.\u2019\u2019 Orwell then went on to undermine Amazon\u2019s argument for cheap e-books. \u2018\u2018It is, of course, a great mistake to imagine that cheap books are good for the book trade,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, saying that the opposite was true. \u2018\u2018The cheaper books become,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, \u2018\u2018the less money is spent on books.\u2019\u2019 Instead of buying two expensive books, he said, the consumer will buy three cheap books and then use the rest of the money to go to the movies. \u2018\u2018This is an advantage from the reader\u2019s point of view and doesn\u2019t hurt trade as a whole, but for the publisher, the compositor, the author and the bookseller, it is a disaster,\u2019\u2019 Orwell wrote. Amazon\u2019s post gave Orwell a big weekend on the Internet. \u2018\u2018Altering Orwell\u2019s words to fit your agenda seems rather ... Orwellian,\u2019\u2019 Josh Centers, a tech writer, said in a Twitter message. \u2018\u2018Only a fool or a businessman would twist that quote so completely,\u2019\u2019 wrote John Biggs in TechCrunch. Glenn Fleishman, a technology journalist, addressed Amazon directly via Twitter: \u2018\u2018He was using irony. It\u2019s a literary device. You sell books. What is wrong with you.\u2019\u2019 In a related development, it became widely known over the weekend that Amazon was in a dispute with yet another supplier, this time Disney. Amazon was doing the same thing with the movie studio that it did with Hachette: preventing customers from preordering physical copies of yet-to-be-released content. Preorders are a way for an entertainment company to gauge demand. Consumers have increasingly been trained to want something the moment it becomes available. When customers lose the ability to order ahead, the companies worry, they might never bother to buy at all. In several cases, as with the latest Muppets movie, the Amazon page offered to email a potential customer when the movie was released. But in at least one case, there seemed to be no product page at all for a physical copy of a movie. \u2018\u2018Captain America: The Winter Soldier\u2019\u2019 is available for preorder as an Amazon Instant Video, but there are no pages for a Blu-ray disc or a DVD. It was unclear whether the pages had been taken down, or never posted. Amazon\u2019s selective sales practices bring Orwell to mind again. In \u2018\u20181984,\u2019\u2019 the Records Department is charged with rewriting the past to fit whomever Oceania is currently fighting. There are \u2018\u2018armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall.\u2019\u2019 In its skirmish with the publishers, Amazon appears to be wielding its technology in bold ways that Orwell would surely recognize. An Amazon spokesman did not respond to questions about Orwell or \u2018\u2018Captain America.\u2019\u2019 Disney did not return calls for comment.",

        "content": " Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, has a growing cloud computing business and a hunger for American companies. And soon, it will most likely have a large amount of cash. Will it take on the American cloud giants? It would be an amazing change from the way cloud computing seems to be developing. Public cloud computing is the rental of infrastructure, like raw computing power and online data storage, and sophisticated applications. It is a multibillion-dollar business, expected to grow much bigger, and is currently led by Amazon Web Services, or AWS; Google; and Microsoft Azure. IBM and others also have designs on the market. To date, all of the big global players are United States companies. In a recent evaluation of the cloud infrastructure business, analysts at the technology research firm Gartner counted 15 companies. Just two, Dimension Data and Fujitsu, were not American firms. There was no mention of Alibaba. Yet according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of Alibaba's proposed public offering, Alibaba had revenue of $102 million from cloud and infrastructure sales last year. That was an increase of 26 percent from a year earlier. That is not the 50 percent annual growth seen at AWS, perhaps, but not bad. So why isn't Alibaba an international cloud contender? Particularly since, as The New York Times reported last week, it has sunk a fortune in American tech companies. Not to mention that at least one of the companies high in Gartner's estimation, Rackspace, told the S.E.C. in May that it had hired Morgan Stanley to find it a partner or acquirer. A spokesman for Alibaba, citing the company's quiet period ahead of its I.P.O., declined to comment on its plans. But people with knowledge of the company said that Alibaba, like other possible Chinese contenders, seemed to have its hands full just handling its China business. Alibaba's cloud business was formed in 2009. Like AWS, it began as a way of serving the company's own online commerce and payment businesses. Its external customers are mostly small and medium Chinese companies. The Chinese website for the service, Aliyun.com, lists mostly Chinese mobile and gaming companies as customers. It also provides online stores for Microsoft and Apple in China. In all, Alibaba says that one million customers tap into its cloud, either directly or through a reseller of computing services. In other ways, however, the company is a laggard, with just three large data centers in China and a smaller one in Hong Kong. AWS, by comparison, has 25 core regional data centers globally, which are backstopped with 52 smaller ''edge locations'' around the world. Another regional facility is being developed in China. In terms of performance, Alibaba cannot come close. For a Chinese site, it does impressive work, handling $5.8 billion in commerce on China's heaviest shopping day. The Alibaba S.E.C. filing says its cloud does 3.6 million computing transactions a minute. That sounds like a lot, until you consider that the AWS databases alone handle 1.5 million transactions a second. Like Baidu and Tencent, two other big Chinese online companies with cloud businesses, Alibaba's focus for now seems to be on mainland China, possibly as a place to learn the business before moving farther out. Like Alibaba, Tencent recently opened a data center in Hong Kong. Politically, Hong Kong is China's special administrative region; practically, it can be a midway point between international and domestic commerce. From there, the probable growth would be in Asia, where China has many existing commercial relationships, or Africa, still mostly open territory for cloud computing. In other words, the American cloud companies should not have to worry in the short term. Further out, however, it's likely that the Chinese clouds will have a lot of paying customers in the domestic market to fuel additional expansion.",

        "content": " Out here in the woods, at the end of not one but two dirt roads, in a shack equipped with a picture of the Dalai Lama, a high-speed data line and a copy of Thoreau\u2019s \u2018\u2018Civil Disobedience,\u2019\u2019 Amazon\u2019s dream of dominating the publishing world has run into some trouble. Douglas Preston, who summers in this coastal hamlet, is a best-selling writer \u2014 or was, until Amazon decided to discourage readers from buying books from his publisher, Hachette, as a way of pressuring it into giving Amazon a better deal on e-books. So he wrote an open letter to his readers asking them to contact Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief, demanding that Amazon stop using writers as hostages in its negotiations. The letter, composed in the shack, spread through the literary community. As of early in the past week, 909 writers had signed on, including household names like John Grisham and Stephen King. It was scheduled to run as a full-page ad in The New York Times this Sunday. Amazon, unsettled by the actions of a group that used to be among its biggest fans, is responding by attacking Mr. Preston, calling the 58-year-old thriller writer \u2018\u2018entitled\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018an opportunist,\u2019\u2019 while simultaneously trying to woo him and his fellow dissenters into silence. Mr. Preston is unswayed. \u2018\u2018Jeff Bezos used books as the cutting edge to help sell everything from computer cables to lawn mowers, and what a good idea that was,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Now Amazon has turned its back on us. Don\u2019t they value us more than that? Don\u2019t they feel any loyalty? That\u2019s why authors are mad.\u2019\u2019 This latest uproar in Amazon\u2019s three-month public battle with Hachette comes at a vulnerable moment for the Internet giant, which is rapidly transforming itself into an empire that not only sells culture but creates it, too. Amazon does not want to be seen as hostile to content creators, one of the four groups it says on its investor relations web page it is expressly set up to serve. But it also has to make enough of a profit to satisfy investors. It is a complicated balancing act. Amazon just surprised Wall Street by saying it might lose more than $800 million this quarter, potentially wiping out its profits for the last three years, partly because creating video content is expensive. The prospect of this unexpected loss has raised questions about whether Amazon\u2019s money-losing ways are finally catching up with it \u2014 and whether that is the real reason it is making new demands on publishers like Hachette. Amazon has been forced to shed its longtime practice of refusing to comment on anything. Asked about the writers\u2019 rebellion, it issued a statement that put the focus back on Hachette, bringing up the United States Justice Department\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against Hachette and other publishers in 2012: \u2018\u2018First, Hachette was willing to break the law to get higher e-book prices, and now they\u2019re determined to keep their own authors in the line of fire in order to achieve that same end. Amazon has made three separate proposals to take authors out of the middle, all of which Hachette has quickly dismissed.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Preston pointed out it was Amazon that put the authors in the line of fire in the first place. Russell Grandinetti, Amazon\u2019s vice president for e-books, has called Mr. Preston twice in recent weeks, trying to get him to endorse the company\u2019s proposals. The most recent proposal would have Amazon selling Hachette books again, but with Hachette and Amazon giving their proceeds to charity. No thanks, Mr. Preston said. A proposal that weakens Hachette by cutting its profits was not in the interests of Hachette\u2019s authors. But he took the opportunity to ask Mr. Grandinetti why Amazon was squeezing the writers in the first place. His response, according to Mr. Preston: \u2018\u2018This was the only leverage we had.\u2019\u2019 Amazon declined to comment. Mr. Preston dismisses Amazon\u2019s suggestions that he is a \u2018\u2018human shield\u2019\u2019 for Hachette, one of the Big Five publishers in the United States. He and the other writers say they are acting independently. Most, in any case, are not published by Hachette. Mr. Preston is not sure how he has found himself in charge of a group calling itself Authors United. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t like fighting,\u2019\u2019 he said. Other writers who signed the letter include Robert A. Caro, Junot D\u00edaz, Malcolm Gladwell, Lemony Snicket (the pen name of Daniel Handler), Michael Chabon, Michael Lewis, Jon Krakauer, Scott Turow, George Saunders, Sebastian Junger, Philip Pullman and Nora Roberts. \u2018\u2018We feel strongly that no bookseller should block the sale of books or otherwise prevent or discourage customers from ordering or receiving the books they want,\u2019\u2019 the letter states. Some writers wholeheartedly supported the letter but were afraid to sign, Mr. Preston said. A few signed it and then backed out, citing the same reason. The Times ad, which cost $104,000, was paid for by a handful of the more successful writers. Mr. Preston\u2019s longtime writing partner, Lincoln Child, is among those with qualms. \u2018\u2018I am very apprehensive,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Child said. \u2018\u2018Not all David and Goliath stories end happily for the little guy. But I think Doug did the right thing.\u2019\u2019 Amazon supporters point to a rival petition on Change.org. It is a rambling love song to the retailer. Signers sometimes append invective denouncing the New York publishers for having the audacity to reject novels. \u2018\u2018There is something wrong with a system that picks those who use their elitist ideas of art to choose who is published,\u2019\u2019 reads a comment. The petition has 7,650 signatures. By comparison, a 2012 Change.org petition calling on Amazon to ban the sale of whale and dolphin meat drew over 200,000 signatures. Mr. Preston is not one of those writers who checks his Amazon ranking on a regular basis, or even totes up his sales. He would rather be writing. But he recently thought he should get some numbers from Hachette. They came in the other morning, and they seemed worth sharing with his wife, Christine. About half his book sales used to come from Amazon. But since the retailer started discouraging orders, his paperback sales are down 61 percent and his e-book sales are down 62 percent. His last novel, written with Mr. Child and published by Hachette in November, was \u2018\u2018White Fire.\u2019\u2019 A week before publication, 25,000 Amazon customers had ordered a copy. Their new novel, \u2018\u2018The Lost Island,\u2019\u2019 came out Tuesday. It had only a few thousand pre-orders, all made before Amazon lowered the boom on Hachette and stopped selling forthcoming Hachette books. Ms. Preston, a photographer, studied the bleak sheet. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s gotten personal,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018Are you worried?\u2019\u2019 Mr. Preston asked. \u2018\u2018Because you should be. What if Amazon says, \u2018Why should we sell Doug Preston\u2019s books? He\u2019s a thorn in our sides.\u2019 Guess what? All this goes away.\u2019\u2019 There is a lot to go. The shack itself is negligible, but the house a few steps away is splendid. It is set on 300 acres owned by the Preston family for much of the past 100 years. Amazon has tried to use Mr. Preston\u2019s success against him.",

        "content": " Maybe Amazon really is rattled by the whole  Authors United   phenomenon  organized by Douglas Preston   . The writers are encouraging their readers to email Jeff Bezos, the Amazon chief executive, and tell him to stop holding books hostage as the company negotiates with Hachette Book Group. Late Friday, Amazon unveiled  Readers United   , and encouraged e-book buyers to email the chief executive of Hachette, whose address was helpfully provided. In introducing the group, Amazon made the same arguments it has been making in the last few weeks: e-books need to be cheaper and Hachette is robbing readers by preventing this from happening. It also provided a list of recommended journalism on the topic \u2014 a very selective list. For readers who are not quite sure exactly what to write to Hachette, Amazon included a list of talking points. The first one is, \u201cWe have noted your illegal collusion,\u201d always an ice-breaker in these sorts of chats. The retailer argues that people against e-books are against the future, and talks about how the book industry hated cheap paperbacks when they were introduced in the 1930s, and said they would ruin the business when they really rejuvenated it. Unfortunately, to clinch its argument it cites the wrong authority: \u201cThe famous author George Orwell came out publicly and said about the new paperback format, if \u2018publishers had any sense, they would combine against them and suppress them.\u2019 Yes, George Orwell was suggesting collusion.\u201d Could the Amazon Books Team, which is credited as the source of this post, have really written this? Because a moment\u2019s Googling would have revealed that the team is misrepresenting this \u201cfamous author.\u201d First, when Orwell wrote that line, he was celebrating Penguin paperbacks, not urging suppression or collusion. Does Amazon, which early in its e-book days  made copies of \u201c1984\u2033 vanish   from Kindles after discovering it did not own the rights, really think George Orwell \u2014 of all people! \u2014 would want to suppress books? Here is what the writer said in the New English Weekly on March 5, 1936: \u201cThe Penguin Books are splendid value for sixpence, so splendid that if the other publishers had any sense they would combine against them and suppress them.\u201d Get it? He liked them. But Orwell then went on to undermine Amazon\u2019s argument much more effectively than Hachette ever has. \u201cIt is of course a great mistake to imagine that cheap books are good for the book trade,\u201d he wrote. \u201cActually it is just the other way about \u2026 The cheaper books become, the less money is spent on books.\u201d Instead of buying two expensive books, he says, the consumer will buy two cheap books and then use the rest of his money to go to the movies. \u201cThis is an advantage from the reader\u2019s point of view and doesn\u2019t hurt trade as a whole, but for the publisher, the compositor, the author and the bookseller, it is a disaster,\u201d Orwell wrote. The real problem, the writer argued in an essay a decade later, \u201cBooks v. Cigarettes,\u201d was with the books themselves. They had a hard time competing against other media \u2014 a point people are still making in 2014. \u201cIf our book consumption remains as low as it has been,\u201d he wrote, \u201cat least let us admit that it is because reading is a less exciting pastime than going to the dogs, the pictures or the pub, and not because books, whether bought or borrowed, are too expensive.\u201d An Amazon spokesman did not respond to questions about whether Orwell was really advocating collusion and not, you know, joking.",

Amazon customers are unable to buy DVDs or Blu-rays of movies like \u201cMuppets Most Wanted\u201d that are coming out in the next few months. Instead,  they can sign up to be   notified   when the movies become available or preorder the Amazon Instant Video.

Eliminating the preorder button is thus a potent weapon for Amazon. It declined to take orders for Warner Home Video for several weeks at the beginning of the summer. And it has been engaged in  a pitched battle with   Hachette   for months, causing some of the publisher\u2019s authors to see their sales on the site drop by half. Disney did not return calls for comment. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment, but in the past the company has stressed that disputes with suppliers were routine for retailers. They certainly are becoming that way at Amazon. One theory is that the company, always a tough negotiator, is losing so much money that it is trying to get an edge anywhere it possibly can. Amazon says it could lose more than $800 million this quarter. The conflict with Disney was first reported by  HomeMediaMagazine.com  ",

        "content": " Google and Barnes & Noble are joining forces to tackle their mutual rival Amazon, zeroing in on a service that Amazon has long dominated: the fast, cheap delivery of books. Starting on Thursday, book buyers in Manhattan, West Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area were to be able to get same-day deliveries from local Barnes & Noble stores through Google Shopping Express, Google\u2019s fledgling online shopping and delivery service. Google Shopping, which began operations about a year ago, allows online shoppers to order products from stores like Costco, Walgreens, Staples and Target, and have them delivered to their doors within hours. The partnership could help Barnes & Noble make inroads into online sales while its brick-and-mortar business remains stagnant. The company has closed 63 stores in the last five years, including some in bustling areas of New York and Washington, leaving it with a base of about 660 retail stores and 700 college campus stores. Its Nook business fell 22 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to its most recent earnings report. Michael P. Huseby, Barnes & Noble\u2019s chief executive, called the arrangement with Google \u2018\u2018a test\u2019\u2019 and said that he viewed it as a way to increase the bookseller\u2019s online reach and improve sales from its physical stores. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s our attempt to link the digital and physical,\u2019\u2019 he said. Amazon poses a persistent and growing threat to Barnes & Noble. Its rise has contributed to lagging sales and diminished foot traffic in Barnes & Noble\u2019s physical stores, and it dominates the online market for print books. Amazon\u2019s popularity as an online shopping destination also has the potential to undercut Google\u2019s lucrative search engine advertising business. By adding Barnes & Noble to its list of 19 retail partners, Google is making a more explicit grab for Amazon\u2019s turf. The partnership also comes at a moment when many authors and book buyers are frustrated with Amazon because of what they say are its punitive negotiating tactics in its standoff with the publisher Hachette over e-book pricing. \u2018\u2018Many of our shoppers have told us that when they read a review of a book or get a recommendation from a friend, they want a really easy way to buy that book and start reading it tonight,\u2019\u2019 Tom Fallows, director of product for Google Shopping Express, said by email. \u2018\u2018We think it\u2019s a natural fit to create a great experience connecting shoppers with their town\u2019s Barnes & Noble.\u2019\u2019 The competition to provide faster shipping has increased in recent years as retailers scramble to claim a piece of the growing e-commerce market. Amazon has already taken the lead in same-day delivery, and on Wednesday it said it had expanded its same-day delivery service to 10 cities from four. Its same-day service costs $5.99 for members of its Prime program, and $9.98 for others. Walmart and eBay have also begun same-day deliveries. Instead of relying on warehouses full of merchandise, Google is using a fleet of couriers to collect products from local stores, sort and bundle them and deliver them within a three- to four-hour window selected by the customer. Delivery is free for subscribers to Google Shopping Express, and costs $4.99 per delivery, per store for others. Membership is free for the first six months. Google has not announced its subscription fee. Barnes & Noble stores participating in the partnership with Google, which include a store in Manhattan, one near Los Angeles and another in San Jose, Calif., will have someone on site to take online orders for books, toys, magazines and other items. Google will collect the orders and hand them to a courier. Barnes & Noble stores have 22,000 to 163,000 titles, depending on the store size. Barnes & Noble is not processing Google Shopping orders on its own website, which also offers free express shipping to its members, and free shipping for orders that are $25 and up to everyone. Instead, it expects to pick up incremental sales from Google Shopping\u2019s customers, said Jaime Carey, chief merchandising officer at Barnes & Noble. \u2018\u2018Google has their own vast customer base,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Carey said. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re going to be reaching a new customer for us.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " Google and Barnes & Noble are joining forces to tackle their mutual rival Amazon, zeroing in on a service that Amazon has long dominated: the fast, cheap delivery of books,  Alexandra Alter reports . Starting on Thursday, book buyers in Manhattan, West Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area will be able to get same-day deliveries from local Barnes & Noble stores through Google Shopping Express, Google\u2019s fledgling online shopping and delivery service. Google Shopping, which began operations about a year ago, allows online shoppers to order products from stores like Costco, Walgreens, Staples and Target, and have them delivered to their doors within hours. The partnership could help Barnes & Noble make inroads into online sales when its brick-and-mortar business remains stagnant. The company has closed 63 stores in the last five years, including some in bustling areas of Manhattan and Washington, leaving it with a base of about 660 stores and 700 others at colleges. Its Nook business fell 22 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the period a year earlier, according its most recent earnings report.  Read more \u00bb",

        "content": " On Tuesday, Oracle kicked off its new cloud computing technology center in Seattle. On hand were several recruiting executives; initially designed for 100 cloud engineers, the facility is expected to hire a lot more and serve as an education and training facility as well. ''We expect this to be a big deal,'' said Prashant Ketkar, the head of products for Oracle's public cloud business. ''We intend to hire more and more.'' This is the biggest move by an established software applications company into Seattle, an important development if Seattle is to continue as the center of the cloud computing industry. Amazon, of course, is based in Seattle, and has the headquarters of Amazon Web Services there. Across Lake Washington, Microsoft's cloud business, Azure, is a centerpiece of chief executive Satya Nadella's plans to spur Microsoft's growth. Google has also located its cloud business in Seattle, and Century Link increased its cloud presence there when it purchased Tier 3 last year. These businesses, for Seattle the result of a combination of luck (Amazon and Microsoft were already there) and cooperation with local universities to build skills in areas like distributed computing, are for the most part about infrastructure, the management of lots of computer servers and networks. What Oracle is doing is more about building up the next level: software applications in the cloud. ''Seattle has emerged with enough talented people, and a growing critical mass of application providers,'' said Mr. Ketkar, who worked on Azure in Seattle from 2008 to 2012. A few local applications companies, like Tableau Software and Concur, have done well in the cloud. Some other Silicon Valley companies, like Adobe, also have cloud businesses there. Oracle has about 120,000 people, so in itself 100 people in Seattle may not look like much. Mr. Ketkar said that the center would play an important role in changing Oracle itself. ''The company will be very different in 10 years,'' he said. ''Sales is changing. The back end operations are changing. The size of deals, and who we work with in an organization. Everything is changing, not just on the technology side.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. The Seattle area is home to Amazon and Microsoft, two leaders in cloud computing, and now Oracle will add a tech center. (PHOTOGRAPH BY ELAINE THOMPSON/ASSOCIATED PRESS)",

        "name": "Cloud Revenue Jumps, Led by Microsoft and IBM ",
        "content": " The virtue of fear as a source of animating energy has long been recognized in the quicksilver tech industry. \u201cOnly the paranoid survive,\u201d as Andrew S. Grove,  Intel \u2019s longtime leader, put it \u2014 a guiding principle that was also the title of  his 1996 book on management . The fear factor is clearly at work now in the fast-growing market for cloud computing. The latest quarterly reports from technology companies and market research show that two of the fastest movers in the emergent cloud business are the incumbent giants of traditional software,  Microsoft   and  IBM . Their business is most at risk from the shift to computing delivered over the Internet from distant data centers, with the business model of a pay-for-use service rather than a product. Microsoft\u2019s cloud revenue jumped 164 percent in the second quarter, while IBM\u2019s surged 86 percent, according to  a report last week   by the Synergy Research Group.  Amazon   is still way ahead, with $962 million in cloud revenue, compared with $370 million for Microsoft, and IBM\u2019s $259 million, Synergy estimates. But Amazon\u2019s growth rate, at 49 percent, was only slightly ahead of the torrid 45 percent pace of the cloud market as a whole. The progress by Microsoft and IBM was emphasized in the companies\u2019 quarterly financial reports and conference calls with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s not just talk \u2014 they are backing it up with a lot of investment,\u201d said John Dinsdale, an analyst at Synergy. The so-called magic quadrant reports by  Gartner , a technology research firm, are closely followed by tech suppliers and their corporate customers. The reports include assessments of tech companies\u2019 strengths and weaknesses as well as a graphic plotting companies on two axes. Left-to-right placement in the graphic is based on \u201ccompleteness of vision,\u201d and bottom-to-top placement shows \u201cability to execute.\u201d \u201cLeaders\u201d are in the upper-right quadrant of the graphic, while \u201cniche players\u201d are consigned to the lower left. In Gartner\u2019s report last year on basic cloud services, IBM was among the niche players (and in 2012, it wasn\u2019t even included as a player at all). This year, helped by  the acquisition of SoftLayer , a cloud start-up, and its own internal investment, it has moved sharply to the right, and higher, though it is not yet in the leaders area \u2014 the vision is strong, according to Gartner, but the execution still lags a bit. Microsoft has moved up and to the right this year, into the leaders area. Last year, Gartner positioned Microsoft about where IBM is this year. Amazon is still the star in Gartner\u2019s chart of the cloud industry, some distance above Microsoft, the only other company in the leaders quadrant, among 15 companies Gartner included in the report. Measurements in the cloud marketplace are tricky. Companies define their cloud businesses differently. And the big companies do not report their cloud revenue or profit separately, although they do occasionally make statements. When Microsoft announced its quarterly results   last month, it declared that its cloud revenue was running at a $4.4 billion annual rate. IBM said its cloud business was 50 percent higher so far this year, but did not supply a dollar figure. In  its annual report , IBM said that its cloud revenue in 2013 was $4.4 billion. So this year would appear to be on track to be well north of $6 billion. Amazon\u2019s cloud revenue, according to a recent estimate by Pacific Crest Securities, will reach $5 billion this year. Yet the Microsoft and IBM numbers include things not in the Amazon estimates. Amazon\u2019s cloud offers computing, storage and basic software tools used by engineers. But Microsoft and IBM add the software delivered to customers over the cloud, from spreadsheets to data-analysis applications. IBM\u2019s revenue total, analysts say, also includes cloud-related services and even hardware used in setting up cloud computing environments that companies own themselves, so-called private clouds. So comparing Microsoft and IBM\u2019s cloud revenue to Amazon\u2019s is not an apples-to-apples exercise. \u201cFor Microsoft, it is apples, oranges and pears,\u201d said Lydia Leong, a Gartner analyst. \u201cFor IBM, it\u2019s apples, oranges, pears, and the kitchen sink.\u201d Yet it is the business beyond basic cloud computing \u2014 beyond the apples, to continue the analogy \u2014 that is most strategic to Microsoft and IBM. They have to convert their lucrative traditional software products to cloud offerings, and both companies are doing that aggressively. Microsoft and IBM may lose licensing revenue in the shift to the lower-cost cloud model, selling services rather than products. But if they don\u2019t make the transition quickly, they will lose their most valuable asset \u2014 their long-term corporate customers. The cloud business today represents a tiny slice of the overall information technology market, but it is where the market is headed. Microsoft and IBM are eager to make that transition, and so are their clients. \u201cIn the past year, we\u2019re seeing customers take the incumbents with them into the cloud,\u201d said Robert P. Mahowald, an analyst at IDC. For tech suppliers, big changes in the models of computing delivery and economics can be brutal or beautiful. In the 1980s and 1990s, the shift away from mainframes and minicomputers to personal computers tethered to corporate servers \u2014 known as client-server computing \u2014 nearly killed IBM, and it made Microsoft the dominant company of that era.",

        "name": "Amazon Wants Cheaper E-Books. But Should It Get to Enforce Prices? ",
        "content": " In a  short blog post   meant to shed light on its  contract dispute with the publisher Hachette , Amazon argued this week that its data proved that lower e-book prices were better for everyone in the market for books. That includes authors, publishers, customers and Amazon itself. Amazon also said that in addition to looking for cheaper books, it was asking for just 30 percent of the price of an e-book \u2014 far less than many in the publishing industry had feared the company was seeking in its dispute with Hachette. At first blush, the retailer\u2019s numbers, and its transparency, are encouraging. But when you compare the market for e-books with other thriving digital markets, a larger question emerges: Why should the price of books be contractually enforced at all? Amazon says its data shows that e-books are \u201cprice elastic\u201d goods \u2014 meaning that sales are sensitive to changes in price. Lower-priced e-books sell vastly more copies than high-priced books, so cheap books result in higher total revenue than if books were more expensive. The company gives one example to support this argument. Based on its sales data, the firm says that an e-book that would sell 100,000 copies at $14.99 each would sell about 174,000 copies at the lower price of $9.99. \u201cTotal revenue at $14.99 would be $1,499,000,\u201d the company notes. \u201cTotal revenue at $9.99 is $1,738,000.\u201d Not only would authors and publishers get 16 percent more money at the lower price, they\u2019d get 74 percent more readers. And each customer, of course, would get to spend a third less. This sounds reasonable. But as you think about Amazon\u2019s example, a couple of red flags pop up. Amazon declined to discuss its blog post on the record, but its post notes that its data is based on aggregate sales over a wide number of books in its Kindle store. This suggests that price elasticity for specific titles varies widely according to author, genre, length, difficulty and perhaps several other factors. This makes intuitive sense: Wouldn\u2019t people pay more for a 750-page book by Stephen King than, say, a 100-pager by an unknown debut novelist, Steven Qing? So while it may be true that $9.99 is better than $14.99 in general, certain books might make the most money at $10.99, $11.99, $12.99 \u2014 or even $2.99. Then there\u2019s the question of the market for print books. Some of the people who are willing to buy an e-book at $9.99 but not at $14.99 might be coming over from the market for print books. So what if the increased revenue that authors and publishers get from low-priced e-books is outweighed by lowered revenue through cannibalized print sales? Amazon, which sells print books, would know whether this is the case, but its post says nothing about print titles. That gets to the larger problem with Amazon\u2019s post. If the optimal market price for an e-book is $9.99, why does Amazon need to push for the lower price as part of a contract negotiation? Why can\u2019t it let publishers set prices for themselves, preferably with the help of Amazon\u2019s sales data, in the hope that they will eventually hit on the economically optimal price? You might say that publishers can\u2019t be trusted to act in their own interest. After all, a federal court has found that  publishers illegally colluded with Apple   to collectively raise the price of books; that collusion resulted in higher prices and lower sales of e-books. So perhaps Amazon feels that it needs to force publishers to settle on $9.99 in most cases because otherwise they\u2019d shoot themselves in the foot. That could be so. But it\u2019s worth noting that contractually enforcing prices is something of an antiquated practice in digital marketplaces. Sure, when Apple set up the iTunes store, it created a set price for songs. But that was more than a decade ago; since then, digital marketplaces have matured, and we\u2019ve seen a dizzying array of new business models. There are subscription-based music and media services, games funded by in-app purchases, social networks funded by ads, and hardware companies funded by e-commerce. Some of these work better than others. But it was only through experimentation that app makers figured out the best way to pay for their code. If Apple hadn\u2019t allowed for this experimentation in its app store \u2014 if Steve Jobs had decided that all apps would cost $2.99, period \u2014 the app market wouldn\u2019t be the thriving multibillion-dollar business it is now. The same logic applies to books. I take Amazon at its word when it says it is interested in creating a thriving market for e-books. But the market for e-books is pretty new, and it stands to reason that the best business model for publishers, authors, readers, and booksellers has yet to be found. In the end, we may see many different ways to pay for books. Creating a single, typical price for e-books would stifle that potentially glorious future; $9.99 might work fine some of the time, but no price is perfect for everyone, always.",

        "content": " CORRECTION APPENDEDAmazon Publishing and Alloy Entertainment, a book packager and division of Warner. Bros Television Group, are collaborating on a new digital publishing imprint dedicated to young adult, new adult and commercial fiction. The imprint, called Alloy Entertainment, released its first three titles on Tuesday: Heather Hildenbrand's ''Imitation,'' a novel about a teenage clone who may have to risk her life to save the wealthy girl she was modeled on; ''Every Ugly Word,'' Aimee Salter's coming-of-age story about a girl who is tormented by bullies and fights with her mother, and ''Rebel Wing'' by Tracy Banghart, a science fiction adventure novel about a pilot who is on a mission to save her war torn region, and be reunited with her boyfriend. The new titles will be released through Amazon Publishing's Powered by Amazon program, which provides global distribution and targeted marketing to Amazon customers. ''This program is an exciting extension of our business and will allow us to leverage Amazon's ability to distribute to an incredibly diverse and broad readership,'' Leslie Morgenstein, president of Alloy Entertainment, said in a statement. Alloy, which is known for creating hit teenage series like ''Gossip Girl,'' ''The Vampire Diaries'' and ''Pretty Little Liars,'' has teamed up with Amazon in the past. Alloy has already licensed several of its properties for Amazon's fan fiction venture, Kindle Worlds, which allows fans to publish and sell stories based on popular novels and shows. With its new digital imprint, Alloy aims to test out titles that could be spun off into TV shows and released later in print. Online Correction: July 29, 2014, Tuesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the title of the book written by Aimee Salter. It is ''Every Ugly Word,'' not ''Every Ugly World.''",

        "content": " At first, Kunal Bahl and his high school buddy Rohit Bansal had modest ambitions for their online shopping site, Snapdeal. Their previous venture \u2014 a physical coupon booklet into which they had sunk their combined savings \u2014 flopped in just months. And online retailing was still a largely unproven endeavor in 2010, particularly in India, a country where most people don\u2019t have bank accounts, let alone credit cards to make purchases on the Internet. When an angel investor offered $200,000 as seed money, they took only half and aimed for just 100 transactions a day. Snapdeal is now on track to handle more than $1 billion in sales this year for over 30,000 merchants across more than 500 categories of goods and services. \u201cWe sell a sari every 12 seconds,\u201d Mr. Bahl said. The rise of Indian e-commerce \u2014 which has started to gain traction only in recent years \u2014 has captured the attention of international investors. This year, Snapdeal has raised $233 million, with about half coming from the American Internet company  eBay . Mr. Bahl said Snapdeal was considering an initial public offering in a year or two. At least half a dozen other leading Indian shopping sites have announced major fund-raising deals in recent months. On Tuesday, Flipkart, India\u2019s largest e-commerce company, said that it had raised $1 billion from investors, including American firms like Tiger Global and Accel Partners. The amount represents the largest ever for an Indian Internet company, and globally, it matches  Facebook \u2019s fund-raising round in February 2011 and ranks only second to  Uber\u2019s $1.2 billion bonanza   this June, according to  Thomson Reuters . \u201cE-commerce in India is poised to take advantage of larger shifts in society,\u201d said Vani Kola, now the managing director of Kalaari Capital and formerly of NEA-IndoUS Ventures, Indian-based venture capital firms that both have invested in Snapdeal. \u201cThe whole industry has begun swiftly growing and evolving.\u201d The investment surge reflects the changing landscape in India. Internet access has rapidly expanded, mostly through mobile devices, and Indians are now increasingly shifting daily activity online, like reading the newspaper, doing bank transactions and buying goods and services, from shoes to refrigerators (with installation included). Billboards, text messages and emails bombard people every day with news of deep online-only discounts and special offers. E-commerce is growing at a compound annual rate of 34 percent, according to the Internet and Mobile Association of India, an industry trade group. But online shopping remains a largely untapped market. While estimates of the total worth of India\u2019s online retail industry vary greatly, most analysts figure that it accounts for less than 1 percent of the country\u2019s $500 billion retail market, which is still mostly cash-driven. Comparatively, China\u2019s e-commerce sales are expected to top $180 billion this year, accounting for roughly 9 percent of the country\u2019s retail spending, according to iResearch Consulting, which specializes in China\u2019s Internet industry. The country\u2019s largest online retailer, Alibaba, is  expected to go public in the coming months   with an estimated value of more than $200 billion. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous headroom still,\u201d Mr. Bahl said. \u201cI think 20 years from now, 20 percent of retail will be online.\u201d Yet particularities to India\u2019s shopping culture have impeded the industry\u2019s growth. By and large, India remains a bastion of the \u201ckirana,\u201d or neighborhood general store, as well as the roving hawkers, whose nasal cries carry the names of their wares through narrow lanes and up to the top floors of apartment buildings. Most people tend to shop from sellers they know personally and live near, running grains of rice through their fingers and smelling the different varieties to determine their quality before, perhaps, moving to the next shop where they might closely inspect the stitch count of a new batch of shirts sold by the local ready-made clothes dealer. These entrenched habits, combined with the newness of the Internet and credit cards, have led to a trust gap between online retailers and their customers. To bridge it, the biggest names in e-commerce, including Snapdeal and Flipkart, allow customers to pay cash upon delivery for their purchases and let consumers return items at the very last second, even when the delivery person arrives at their door. To address the widespread perception that the state\u2019s postal service is unreliable, e-commerce players like Snapdeal, Flipkart and Jabong have developed their own delivery logistics companies. Snapdeal and others have built fulfillment centers and hired delivery workers to help ensure packages arrive in a timely fashion. The logistic network, in part, has helped Snapdeal court small business owners to its marketplace. \u201cIn the early days,\u201d Mr. Bahl said, \u201cwe were calling every family and friend who we knew was running a small business or wanting to start one, and for whom nationwide distribution would be a godsend. It was quite hard to convince them, given many of them hadn\u2019t ever used the Internet themselves.\u201d Momentum is now on the industry\u2019s side. Mr. Bahl said that the company barely needed to recruit merchants any more, with 80 percent requesting to join Snapdeal. \u201cVirality amongst small business owners is very acute,\u201d Mr. Bahl said. \u201cIf one sees success, then word spreads really, really fast.\u201d Once merchants join the site, Snapdeal works with them to develop their listings and bolster sales. When Rakesh Sareen, 29, started selling his line of traditional women\u2019s clothing made of locally sourced materials, Snapdeal, as part of its services, promoted the introduction and covered the cost of a photo shoot and online catalog. \u201cThey send out targeted newsletters, which promote our products, and their fashion category manager advises us on trends as well as updates on how certain products of mine are selling,\u201d said Mr. Sareen, who had just returned from a trip to the villages where he buys woven fabric. Looming large over the industry is last year\u2019s entrance in India of  Amazon . Huge American online retailers like Amazon and eBay own marketplace platforms here, which, like Snapdeal and Flipkart, connect merchants with consumers. But the country\u2019s regulations prevent Amazon and other overseas players from selling directly to consumers from their own inventory as they do elsewhere. Currently, foreign investment in multibrand retail is limited to 51 percent. There are hints that the system may be changing, at least in the online space. The current government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, is perceived as backing small business owners who fear that opening retailing to foreign behemoths will put them out of business. But  Narendra Modi , India\u2019s new prime minister, recently urged the industry to embrace change at a widely televised rally during his election campaign. \u201cThere is no need to fear global challenges,\u201d said Mr. Modi, adding, \u201cthis is the age of online marketing, so accept modern science and make use of it.\u201d Amazon in particular stands to benefit from any change to the existing rules. \u201cCustomer loyalty isn\u2019t so strong yet, so it\u2019s conceivable that Amazon would either look to buy big names here, or their expansion might just kill some of the smaller horizontals altogether,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, the founder and editor of  Medianama.com , which analyzes India\u2019s digital economy. On Monday, Amazon announced that it would open five new fulfillment centers across India to bring its nationwide total to seven. In a recent email, a spokeswoman for Amazon in India affirmed that the company was in \u201ccontinual dialogue\u201d with the government and that it strongly supports \u201copening up this sector\u201d to foreign direct investment. Mr. Bahl of Snapdeal seems unfazed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t affect our marketplace,\u201d he said. Within the next year, he thinks Snapdeal\u2019s network of sellers will reach 100,000, and the company plans to double its number of fulfillment centers as well as engineering employees. As for the prospect of competition from Amazon, he thinks that small businesses will congregate on marketplace platforms like Snapdeal\u2019s so as to collaboratively compete against the giants. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are going to help small businesses compete against Amazon,\u201d Mr. Bahl said. \u201cWe are that platform.\u201d",

        "name": "Push From Gates Leads to Book's Unlikely Revival ",
        "content": " Summertime reading lists are typically heavy on page-turning novels -- not a collection of business articles, published as a book in 1969, and long out of print until a few weeks ago. But ''Business Adventures,'' by John Brooks, a staff writer at The New Yorker who died in 1993, and originally published by Weybright and Talley, which is no longer around, has suddenly become a Lazarus-like publishing hit. As I write this, ''Business Adventures'' is No. 3 on the Amazon list of top-selling books. It is No. 1 on Amazon's ''Hot New Releases'' list, and No.1 on its ''Most Wished For'' list. The reason is an emphatic endorsement from Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and philanthropist, whose star power still burns bright in business circles. For years, Mr. Gates has recommended books including a summertime collection on his website, Gates Notes, with selections weighted toward science and policy subjects. But this summer, Mr. Gates declared that ''Business Adventures'' was his favorite business book, and that he has read it repeatedly since 1991, when his friend Warren E. Buffett gave him a copy. And Mr. Gates and his personal office decided to do more, undertaking a campaign to bring the book back to life and introduce it to a whole new audience. Mr. Gates's emissaries got in touch with the Brooks family and a publisher, Open Road Media, which brought ''Business Adventures'' out as an e-book on July 8 (a paperback edition is scheduled for August). The Gates team, in doing a little research, found a ''whole army of Brooks disciples,'' said Andy Cook, a general manager in Mr. Gates's personal office. A few of them make appearances in a short video posted on the Gates website including Adam Gopnik, a writer at The New Yorker, and two of my Times colleagues, James B. Stewart and Diana B. Henriques. [Video: Bill Gates on his favorite business book. Watch on YouTube.] The video clip accompanies a lengthy appreciation of ''Business Adventures'' written by Mr. Gates. His personal office also got in touch with The Wall Street Journal, so his piece would be published in The Journal on Friday July 11. It was published on the Gates website, with the video, the following day. The piece on Gates Notes also offers a link to download a free chapter, ''XeroxXeroxXeroxXerox.'' (''The headline alone,'' Mr. Gates writes, ''belongs in the Journalism Hall of Fame.'') Sales of the book began to take off with the weekend media blitz, and the momentum has continued, said Michael Palgon, senior vice president for business development at Open Road. The Brooks book was a good fit for the publisher, founded in 2009, with its focus on reviving worthy classics. Open Road had already been in contact with the literary agent representing the Brooks estate, but about two other Brooks books, ''The Go-Go Years,'' his best seller until now, and ''Once in Golconda,'' Mr. Palgon said. Word that Bill Gates was about to declare ''Business Adventures'' his favorite business book made it the priority. The case Mr. Gates makes for ''Business Adventures'' is the value of understanding the patterns of history. Brooks chronicled the triumphs and travails in the 1950s and '60s of Xerox, General Electric, Ford and other companies. His business articles were rich in social history, literary and artistic references, and wit. In the video interview, Mr. Gates called the Brooks articles ''particularly fun and interesting and instructive.'' They are stories with lessons. ''The rules of running a great business, of value creation,'' Mr. Gates said, ''are unchanged.'' In one article, after a several thousand words of detailed description of Ford's Edsel, Brooks delivered his verdict on the costly dud, in signature John Brooks style. ''And yet, in a way, the Edsel wasn't so bad,'' he wrote. ''It embodied much of the spirit of the time -- or at least the time when it was designed, early in 1955. It was clumsy, powerful, dowdy, gauche, well-meaning -- a de Kooning woman.'' Despite being the go-between, Mr. Gates and his office have no financial stake in the success of the rediscovered book. Still, the strong sales, Mr. Cook said, are ''a nice side benefit, an upside in celebration of his work.'' To sample more John Brooks, The New Yorker has generously pulled three Brooks classics from its archives and posted them on its web site. His subjects are the playfully named retailer Piggly Wiggly , Ford's misadventure with the Edsel , and the high-handed Spanish financier Juan March. The Brooks pieces are terrific, but so are the cartoons and advertisements, enjoyed as delightful time capsules. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

        "content": " Investors received some bad news about the American shopper on Friday, driving down stocks and sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a loss for the week. Two major companies -- the retail giant Amazon and the credit card processor Visa -- both said that the second half of the year was looking more troubled than originally expected. The cautious outlook from two companies so heavily exposed to consumer spending unnerved investors, causing the stock market to fall at the open and remain lower throughout the day. ''Visa put a lot of caution into the market this morning,'' said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. The Dow dropped 123.23 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,960.57. It's the first time the Dow has closed below the 17,000-point mark since July 9. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.64 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,978.34, and the Nasdaq composite fell 22.54 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,449.56. With Friday's selling, the Dow fell 0.8 percent this week. The S.&P. 500 closed basically unchanged and the Nasdaq rose 0.4 percent this week. Visa was the biggest decliner among the blue chips, falling $7.97, or 3.6 percent, to $214.77. The company reported an 11 percent rise in quarterly profit but cut its full-year forecast on concerns about growth overseas. Because the Dow is a price-weighted index, and Visa is the most expensive stock in the Dow, Visa had an outsize impact on it. Roughly 60 points of the Dow's decline can be attributed to Visa. Investors have closely watched Visa ever since it went public in 2008. Credit cards that use Visa's payment system are in nearly every person's pocket, and each time a consumer buys a product with a Visa card, the company takes a small percentage. To see Visa give a cautious outlook is worrisome, Ms. Krosby said. ''Visa represents the consumer and the consumer is one of the most important pieces for the future of this economic recovery,'' she said. Amazon's quarterly results didn't help investor sentiment, either. Its stock slumped 10 percent after the company late Thursday posted a much wider loss than analysts had forecast, hit by expenses. It is focused on spending the money it makes to expand into new areas and products, including a smartphone, the Fire, which started selling on Friday. Amazon shares fell $34.60, or almost 10 percent, to close at $324.01, the biggest decliner in the S.&P. 500 index. Investors retreated from riskier stocks and moved into traditional havens at times of uncertainty: bonds and gold. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note eased to 2.47 percent, from 2.50 percent late on Thursday, as demand for the government bond rose. Gold climbed $12.50, or 1 percent, to $1,303.10 an ounce. There was some positive news on Friday from the Commerce Department, which reported that orders for durable goods increased 0.7 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis, after a decline of 1 percent in May. The strength last month came from solid gains in demand for commercial aircraft and machinery. In other company news, Starbucks fell $1.71, or 2 percent, to $78.74, despite reporting a profit above analysts' expectations. El Pollo Loco stock surged $9.03, or 60 percent, to $24.03 on its first day of trading in the public market. The company, a grilled chicken restaurant chain, priced its shares at $15 a share late Thursday.

The Prime shipping club, for example, picked up more members in the second quarter than it did in the second quarter of 2013, and Prime members buy more than non-Prime members. \u201cThere is some short-term impact but great long-term impact,\u201d Mr. Szkutak said.

But losses mushroomed. Amazon had a net loss of $126 million, or 27 cents a share. A year ago, it lost $7 million, or 2 cents a share. Analysts had forecast a loss of 15 cents a share. Amazon, which is based in Seattle, long ago transcended its roots as a simple retailer. In recent weeks it introduced Zocalo, a document storage and sharing service that grew out of its fast-growing web services division. It began a program to allow readers to consume as many e-books as they want for a set monthly fee. And it is starting to ship its long-awaited entry in the smartphone sweepstakes. The phone, the result of years of development by thousands of Amazon programmers and designers, is meeting some resistance from reviewers. They expected a device modeled after the Kindle tablet \u2014 functional and cheap, meant for the masses rather than trendsetters. Instead, the Fire phone is expensive and loaded with innovative features that, some reviewers said, do not work particularly well. Mr. Szkutak declined to say whether Amazon would ever tell investors how many phones it sold. \u201cI can\u2019t comment on what we might or might not do here,\u201d he said. For the current quarter, Amazon forecast that the losses would only grow. It expects a healthy rise in revenue but an operating loss of as much as $810 million, compared with a loss of $25 million in the third quarter of 2013. Mr. Szkutak listed some of the reasons: Amazon Web Services is in a price-cutting war with Google and others. Six new warehouses have opened. And the company will spend $100 million on new content to put on those phones and Kindles. \u201cAnalysts are going to have to cut their forward outlook for profitability once again,\u201d Mr. Gillis of BGC Partners said. Now that Amazon is in the content creation business, he added, the investments will be continuous. \u201cYou always need more episodes.\u201d Amazon shares have been under pressure for much of this year, and at one point were down about 25 percent. Investors apparently were a little weary of an endless cycle of investment with little to show for it. Recently, however, the stock has rebounded somewhat, to the point where it was only about 10 percent off its high. The quarterly results are likely to reinforce claims that Amazon is squeezing book publishers to make up for all those investments \u2014 not, as the company claims, simply to benefit customers. During the quarter,  a conflict with a major publisher   , Hachette, went public. Amazon wants terms that Hachette feels are ruinous, and both sides are accusing the other of bad faith. Amazon has come under pressure from many prominent authors, who accuse it of holding their books hostage. Other authors, who use Amazon\u2019s self-publishing platform, have rallied to the retailer\u2019s side. Whatever deal is ultimately struck, Amazon has been the loser in the public relations war. It is trying to get the dispute out of the news by making a deal with Hachette writers to give them the income they are losing now. The writers, however, are resisting being drawn further into the conflict. \u201cAmazon has to change the way it thinks about its problem of trying to become profitable,\u201d said Douglas Preston, a best-selling Hachette writer who has drawn up a petition that has nearly a thousand signatures, some of them well-known writers. They include Michael Chabon, Ron Chernow and Stephen King. \u201cAmazon has enormous negotiating tools at its disposal, so why does it need to hurt authors, block the sale of books and inconvenience its own customers every time it runs into a rough patch negotiating with a publisher?\u201d Mr. Preston asked.

        "name": "Challenges for Amazon\u2019s Cloud Computing Hopes ",
        "content": " How worried should Amazon be about its biggest hope for the future? The giant online retailer has long said that its business selling computing services over the Internet, called Amazon Web Services, would eventually be the size of its mainstay business of selling stuff. In Thursday\u2019s earnings report, however, growth of the business looks to have dramatically slowed in ways that hadn\u2019t been seen before. A.W.S. is still tiny, compared with Amazon\u2019s efforts in books, devices and reselling for others. Amazon does not break out figures for the web services, but company executives confirm that the division is by far the biggest part of the \u201cother\u201d category of its reported revenue. For the second fiscal quarter, that segment was $1.2 billion, a rise of 37 percent from a year earlier. While impressive, that is far less than the growth rates of 50 percent or more recorded for multiple quarters. Compared with the first quarter, the sector actually shrank 3.2 percent. There hadn\u2019t been a consecutive drop since the Amazon\u2019s first quarter of 2013, and that was because of the heavy use the web service gets during the holiday season. This time, the money just didn\u2019t come in. What happened? Certainly, the law of large numbers says nothing can grow at nosebleed rates forever. This seems early in the game for a slowdown, however, since Amazon Web Services and its competitors think public cloud computing will eventually dominate the global computing business. On an earnings call, executives said A.W.S. had to respond to price pressure. Specifically, in late March, Google announced  dramatic price cuts   for its cloud business, which Amazon had to match. Microsoft, which offers a cloud business called  Azure   to the public, has a policy of matching Amazon, and followed suit. A.W.S., which still hosts the biggest corporate names in its public cloud, put a brave face on things. \u201cAWS continues to grow strongly,\u201d the company said in   its earnings release , \u201cwith usage growth close to 90 percent year over year in the second quarter.\u201d Amazon also said that A.W.S. staff \u201cgrew by thousands of employees this past year.\u201d That may point to a deeper problem for A.W.S. than one-time price cuts. As public cloud computing moves from a service for developers and experimentation, and into a mainstream corporate business, getting business is going to cost more and take longer. \u201cEnterprise adoption is pretty tough for the public cloud \u2014 not because of security, but because of all the agreements that have to be made throughout an organization,\u201d said Chris Gaun, global cloud strategist at Apprenda, a company that works with public clouds, including Amazon, to help companies move their computing there. \u201cA real sales cycle is 12 months,\u201d he said, compared with a few minutes when a single individual is signing up for A.W.S. Price, people and time are costs that don\u2019t play well for A.W.S., given the big competitors now seriously in the business. In its most recent quarters, Amazon had $5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Google had $59 billion, and Microsoft had $88 billion. IBM, which is also building a public cloud business, had $10 billion and a substantial amount of debt to service. What Amazon\u2019s service does have is a great roster of named clients, and probably lots more companies that aren\u2019t ready to admit somebody else runs their computers. It has an enormous cloud and a technical understanding of global-scale computing that is second to none. All it needs is a bigger sales team for businesses and a way to get its checks signed faster.",

        "name": "Behind the gimmicks of the Fire Phone, a simple device for the rest of us; State of the Art ",
        "content": " When Amazon.com unveiled its first smartphone last month, Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive, said the device had been partly inspired by one of his favorite childhood books, \u2018\u2018Mr. Pine\u2019s Purple House.\u2019\u2019 In the book, by Leonard P. Kessler, friendly old Mr. Pine grows weary of the 50 identical white houses, all in a line, on Vine Street. When he paints his house purple, his radical color scheme sets off an explosion of architectural innovation among his neighbors on Vine Street, which apparently has a pretty lenient homeowner\u2019s association. Mr. Bezos\u2019s message was clear: The smartphone industry had lately grown dull, and Amazon\u2019s new offering, the Fire Phone, would be a fresh perspective on a now-boring device. But as I tested out the Fire Phone over the last week, Amazon\u2019s comparison to Mr. Pine became less flattering. When Mr. Pine paints his house purple, he isn\u2019t trying to improve how it functions. He\u2019s merely trying to stand out from the crowd. Some of the Fire Phone\u2019s headline features feel as if they were born of the same superficial impulse. That\u2019s especially true of Dynamic Perspective, a system of sensors and head-tracking cameras that allows the phone to respond to how users hold or look at it; in some apps, Dynamic Perspective provides a sensation of three-dimensional imagery. While technically impressive, the system rarely makes for a substantive improvement in how you\u2019ll use your phone. Amazon\u2019s focus on the Fire Phone\u2019s flashier side is unfortunate, because when I dug beneath the gimmicks, I found something better than 3-D heroics. The Fire Phone is uncommonly friendly and easy to use. As a bare-bones smartphone, it should prove especially attractive to people who find themselves overwhelmed by today\u2019s crop of do-it-all superphones. When you forget about its whiz-bang marketing, the Fire begins to stand out as something much more interesting: a phone for the rest of us. Let\u2019s run through the basics. The Fire Phone, which is available only on AT&T\u2019s network, sells for $199 with a two-year contract, or for 24 payments of $27.09 with an AT&T contract-free plan. That\u2019s essentially the same price as other top phones, but Amazon throws in a couple of extras that make it a slightly more attractive deal. The Fire Phone has 32 gigabytes of storage, compared with half as much for similarly priced iPhones and Galaxys. It also comes with a year\u2019s subscription to Amazon\u2019s $99 Prime membership plan, which offers discounted shipping and free access to a large library of videos and TV shows. If you already subscribe to Prime, you\u2019ll get an extra year free when you buy the phone. And unlike Apple and Samsung, Amazon throws in free, unlimited online storage for every single photo you take on the Fire Phone, an incredibly handy feature. Storage for videos, though, isn\u2019t free. The Fire Phone, which runs a heavily customized version of Google\u2019s Android operating system, isn\u2019t as powerful as other high-end phones. It doesn\u2019t have as many apps as those for Android and Apple\u2019s iOS, and it does not plug as neatly into Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s content and services ecosystems. Also, this phone is no looker. An indistinct slab of glass and plastic, the Fire Phone looks more like a minimalist prototype than a finished product. But what the Fire Phone lacks in aesthetics and breadth of capabilities, it makes up for in ease of use. Consider the phone\u2019s main app-launching interface, the \u2018\u2018carousel,\u2019\u2019 which should be familiar to people who\u2019ve used Amazon\u2019s Kindle Fire tablets. The interface constantly sorts your apps according to how recently you\u2019ve used them. This let me navigate my phone very efficiently, often saving me from getting lost in a sea of apps \u2014 a common occurrence on most other phones. And if you ever get bogged down, stuck, lost or curious while you\u2019re using the Fire Phone, help is never far. Just tap the Mayday button, and faster than you can believe it, a live, friendly human tech-support agent appears on your screen, ready to help. (Mayday made its debut on the Kindle Fire tablets last year.) I called up Mayday four times to pepper its agents with questions. In every case, a person popped up on the screen in under 10 seconds. Because the agent can see your screen (not your face), the calls were often productive. When I asked how to get the clock to stop disappearing from the top of my screen, an agent took me to the specific settings panel I needed. He saved me many minutes of searching, and perhaps even from throwing the phone at the wall in frustration. If Amazon\u2019s agents can maintain their speed and friendliness, Mayday will prove to be one of the best features on any smartphone. It would instantly render tech support on most other phones embarrassingly obsolete. Given the wonders of Mayday, unlimited photo storage and the carousel interface, it\u2019s unfortunate that Amazon has decided to heavily promote the phone\u2019s more out-there features, including Dynamic Perspective and Firefly. Firefly is an image- and audio-recognition system that lets the Fire identify real-world items. Point the Fire at a retail product, or even some text, and it will usually recognize what you\u2019re looking at. But while Firefly is great at figuring out what it\u2019s seeing or hearing, it doesn\u2019t do much beyond that. When you identify an item, it presents a list of potential actions \u2014 at the top of the list, for most items, is the option to go to Amazon to buy it. App makers can add to Firefly\u2019s functionality: For example, MyFitnessPal lets you track your diet based on packaged foods you\u2019ve recognized using Firefly. In time, we might see more such useful apps built. I\u2019m hoping for a Firefly home inventory app. Right now, though, I don\u2019t see much use for it. That brings us back to Dynamic Perspective, the 3-D head-tracking thing. At its best, Dynamic Perspective adds helpful gestures that allow you to get around the phone more quickly. Snap the phone to the right while you\u2019re in the calendar app, you see your daily agenda; snap left and the agenda disappears. But these shortcuts are never reliable; a lot of times you\u2019ll snap and nothing will happen, because the app you\u2019re in isn\u2019t coded for gestures. As with Firefly, I expect that Dynamic Perspective might become more useful as developers add support. But right now, like a splashy new coat of purple paint, Dynamic Perspective feels like a difference merely for the sake of being different. It suggests that Amazon can\u2019t see its own best innovation: In the Fire Phone, Amazon has built a really nice, solid, plain white house. You\u2019ll love living in it, if you can ignore all the purple.",

In the book, by Leonard Kessler, friendly old Mr. Pine grows weary of the 50 identical white houses, all in a line, on Vine Street. When he paints his house purple, his radical color scheme sets off an explosion of architectural innovation among his neighbors on Vine Street, which apparently has a pretty lenient homeowner's association. Mr. Bezos's message was clear: The smartphone industry had lately grown dull, and Amazon's new offering, the Fire Phone, would be a fresh perspective on a now-boring device. But as I tested out the Fire Phone over the last week, Amazon's comparison to Mr. Pine became less flattering. When Mr. Pine paints his house purple, he isn't trying to improve how it functions. He's merely trying to stand out from the crowd. Some of the Fire Phone's headline features feel as if they were born of the same superficial impulse. That's especially true of Dynamic Perspective, a system of sensors and head-tracking cameras that allows the phone to respond to how users hold or look at it; in some apps, Dynamic Perspective provides a sensation of three-dimensional imagery. While technically impressive, the system rarely makes for a substantive improvement in how you'll use your phone. Amazon's focus on the Fire Phone's flashier side is unfortunate, because when I dug beneath the gimmicks, I found something better than 3-D heroics. The Fire Phone is uncommonly friendly and easy to use. As a bare-bones smartphone, it should prove especially attractive to people who find themselves overwhelmed by today's crop of do-it-all superphones. When you forget about its whiz-bang marketing, the Fire begins to stand out as something much more interesting: a phone for the rest of us. Let's run through the basics. The Fire Phone, which is available only on AT&T's network, sells for $199 with a two-year contract, or for 24 payments of $27.09 with an AT&T contract-free plan. That's essentially the same price as other top phones, but Amazon throws in a couple of extras that make it a slightly more attractive deal. The Fire Phone has 32 gigabytes of storage, compared with half as much for similarly priced iPhones and Galaxys. It also comes with a year's subscription to Amazon's $99 Prime membership plan, which offers discounted shipping and free access to a large library of videos and TV shows. If you already subscribe to Prime, you'll get an extra year free when you buy the phone. And unlike Apple and Samsung, Amazon throws in free, unlimited online storage for every single photo you take on the Fire Phone, an incredibly handy feature. Storage for videos, though, isn't free. The Fire Phone, which runs a heavily customized version of Google's Android operating system, isn't as powerful as other high-end phones. It doesn't have as many apps as those for Android and Apple's iOS, and it does not plug as neatly into Apple's and Google's content and services ecosystems. Also, this phone is no looker. An indistinct slab of glass and plastic, the Fire Phone looks more like a minimalist prototype than a finished product. But what the Fire Phone lacks in aesthetics and breadth of capabilities, it makes up for in ease of use. Consider the phone's main app-launching interface, the ''carousel,'' which should be familiar to people who've used Amazon's Kindle Fire tablets. The interface constantly sorts your apps according to how recently you've used them. This let me navigate my phone very efficiently, often saving me from getting lost in a sea of apps -- a common occurrence on most other phones. And if you ever get bogged down, stuck, lost or curious while you're using the Fire Phone, help is never far. Just tap the Mayday button, and faster than you can believe it, a live, friendly human tech-support agent appears on your screen, ready to help. (Mayday made its debut on the Kindle Fire tablets last year.) I called up Mayday four times to pepper its agents with questions. In every case, a person popped up on the screen in under 10 seconds. Because the agent can see your screen (not your face), the calls were often productive. When I asked how to get the clock to stop disappearing from the top of my screen, an agent took me to the specific settings panel I needed. He saved me many minutes of searching, and perhaps even from throwing the phone at the wall in frustration. If Amazon's agents can maintain their speed and friendliness, Mayday will prove to be one of the best features on any smartphone. It would instantly render tech support on most other phones embarrassingly obsolete. Given the wonders of Mayday, unlimited photo storage and the carousel interface, it's unfortunate that Amazon has decided to heavily promote the phone's more out-there features, including Dynamic Perspective and Firefly. Firefly is an image- and audio-recognition system that lets the Fire identify real-world items. Point the Fire at a retail product, or even some text, and it will usually recognize what you're looking at. But while Firefly is great at figuring out what it's seeing or hearing, it doesn't do much beyond that. When you identify an item, it presents a list of potential actions -- at the top of the list, for most items, is the option to go to Amazon to buy it. App makers can add to Firefly's functionality: For example, MyFitnessPal lets you track your diet based on packaged foods you've recognized using Firefly. In time, we might see more such useful apps built. I'm hoping for a Firefly home inventory app. Right now, though, I don't see much use for it. That brings us back to Dynamic Perspective, the 3-D head-tracking thing. At its best, Dynamic Perspective adds helpful gestures that allow you to get around the phone more quickly. Snap the phone to the right while you're in the calendar app, you see your daily agenda; snap left and the agenda disappears. But these shortcuts are never reliable; a lot of times you'll snap and nothing will happen, because the app you're in isn't coded for gestures. Other instances of Dynamic Perspective are downright annoying. Take Auto Scroll, which moves the text on your screen as you tilt the phone back and forth. Because Auto Scroll calibrates its scrolling speed according to how you're holding the device when you first load up an article, your brain will struggle to find a set rule about how much to tilt to get the right speed. Often I'd scroll too fast or too slow. Worse, if you put your phone down on a table while you're in the middle of an article, the scrolling goes haywire and you lose your place. The best thing about Auto Scroll is that you can turn it off. As with Firefly, I expect that Dynamic Perspective might become more useful as developers add support. But right now, like a splashy new coat of purple paint, Dynamic Perspective feels like a difference merely for the sake of being different. It suggests that Amazon can't see its own best innovation: In the Fire Phone, Amazon has built a really nice, solid, plain white house. You'll love living in it, if you can ignore all the purple.

        "content": " A Friendly Giant, if It's Fed ''Feed the Beast (or Else),'' in Sunday Business last week, examined the realignment of the book publishing world as Amazon's reach widens. The article looked at Amazon's current battle for book-sale concessions from one publisher, Hachette -- and at the deep divisions among writers over Amazon's ever-growing influence on their trade. These reader reactions, drawn from nytimes.com, have been edited and condensed: Yesterday I treated myself to a trip to our one local independent bookstore. A book was prominently displayed and I began reading it and bought it. It is a wonderful book, but I would never have discovered it by browsing online. Our intellectual world will be impoverished if we ever lose bookstores and libraries completely. Since the feud with Hachette was publicized, I have stopped shopping at Amazon almost 100 percent and have allowed myself to purchase full-price books at my local bookstores. HDB, TENNESSEE Whatever little profit is made off a book, I'd rather Jeff Bezos & Company invest it in the technologies of the future (like Amazon Web Services or another iteration of Fire) than have mom and pop put it under their mattress. BILLYD, NEW JERSEY I love the mystery and special companionship offered by my favorite books. I have long worked for various publishers. I don't buy from Amazon. But after these announcements, I appreciate an article that attempts to portray the complicated scenario playing out in an industry that has clung to the romantic ways ''things used to be.'' What responsibility do we as consumers play? If you go into a brick-and-mortar store and scan titles and then turn to buy them for a cheaper amount on Amazon, how can you blame Amazon for the disappearance of the old and for its dominance? JIMI, CINCINNATI I've always had mixed feelings about Amazon, and this article reinforced that. Amazon has been an invaluable source for titles that are small-press, university press, scholarly, specialty, etc. Amazon could get things that brick-and-mortar stores couldn't. Amazon needs not to overreach. It needs to nurture those small, esoteric presses, because it might find that easy, reliable access to their titles is its unique selling point.

        "name": "Amazon Unveils E-Book Subscription Service, With Some Notable Absences ",
        "content": " After months of speculation, Amazon on Friday introduced a digital subscription service that allows subscribers unlimited access to a library e-books and audiobooks for $10 a month. The service, Kindle Unlimited, offers a Netflix-style, all-you-can-read approach to more than 600,000 e-books, including blockbuster series like ''The Hunger Games'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid,'' nonfiction titles like ''Flash Boys'' by Michael Lewis, as well as literary fiction and classics. So far, however, none of the five biggest publishers appear to be making their books available through the service. HarperCollins, Hachette and Simon & Schuster, for example, are not participating, representatives from the three companies confirmed. Penguin Random House and Macmillan declined to comment, but a search on Amazon suggests that they are not making their books available. As a result, some popular titles were noticeably absent when the service began on Friday. Subscribers who want to read Laura Hillenbrand's ''Unbroken'' or Veronica Roth's ''Divergent'' will not find those books on Kindle Unlimited, at least not yet. (Books that can be downloaded free as part of the subscription have an orange ''Kindle Unlimited'' icon under the title, along with a price tag of $0.00.) And because many authors publish with more than one house, subscribers may find that they can download certain books by, say, Margaret Atwood or Michael Chabon, but not other titles by the same authors. The introduction of the service comes as the relationship between the major publishers and Amazon has grown increasingly tense. The online retailer faces growing scrutiny for its dominance of the e-book market and its tough negotiating tactics with publishers. Amazon and Hachette have been engaged in a lengthy public standoff over e-book terms that remains unresolved. Among the imprints making their books available to the service are Scholastic, which published ''The Hunger Games'' series, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. News of Kindle Unlimited was reported earlier this week, when Amazon accidentally posted a promotional video for the subscription model. The video was quickly taken down from Amazon's website, but not before technology bloggers noticed. In offering the service, Amazon is entering an increasingly crowded marketplace. It will be competing with publishing start-ups offering similar services, like Scribd and Oyster, which charge a comparable subscription fee and have comparable digital libraries. Scribd has some 400,000 titles and charges subscribers $9 a month. Oyster has more than 500,000 titles available and gives readers unlimited access for $10 a month. With similar pricing models, the competition among e-book subscription services could come down to content and what books and authors are included. Scribd's subscription service includes books from more than 900 publishers, including Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins and Wiley. Oyster offers titles from six of the top 10 American publishers, according to a company representative. Publishers receive payments whenever one of their books is downloaded and a certain percentage is read. ''An increasing number of people want to read in this way, just like they consume movies this way and listen to music this way,'' said Eric Stromberg, Oyster's chief executive. ''The unlimited model is just a better experience.'' Still, Amazon is entering the arena with a huge advantage: its dominance within digital publishing, and its vast audiobook library, which it is bundling into the subscription service. Amazon owns Audible and is including more than 2,000 digital audio titles in Kindle Unlimited. Through the company's Whispersync for Voice technology, users can toggle between digital audiobooks and e-books, alternately listening and reading without losing their place in the story. Russ Grandinetti, a Kindle senior vice president, said in a statement that Kindle Unlimited was ''by far the most cost-effective way to enjoy audiobooks and e-books together.'' ''You can easily switch between reading and listening to a book, allowing the story to continue even when your eyes are busy,'' he said.

        "name": "Apple Could Pay $400 Million In E-Books Price-Fixing Case ",
        "content": " The number is in for how much Apple might have to pay to consumers to settle charges of conspiring with publishers to raise e-book prices: $400 million. Apple last month agreed to settle a class action brought by attorneys general in 33 states. They had sought hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from Apple, claiming it had colluded with book publishers to inflate e-book prices. The class action was certified after Apple lost an earlier antitrust suit brought by the Justice Department in 2012. The government had accused Apple of working with the publishers to raise prices of e-books so that they could break free from the uniform $9.99 pricing that Amazon had set for new e-book releases. The amount Apple would actually have to pay in the class action depends on the outcome of Apple's appeal in that antitrust suit. If Apple wins the appeal, it could pay nothing. Five major publishers, including Hachette Book Group, Simon & Schuster and HarperCollins, had also been named in the government's antitrust suit, but they all settled before the trial. The judge presiding over the case, Denise L. Cote of United States District Court in Manhattan, rendered a guilty verdict last summer. Eric T. Schneiderman, New York's attorney general, said the settlement reached with Apple was a victory for consumers. ''This settlement proves that even the biggest, most powerful companies in the world must play by the same rules as everyone else,'' he said in a statement. ''In a major victory, our settlement has the potential to result in Apple paying hundreds of millions of dollars to consumers to compensate them for paying unlawfully inflated e-book prices. We will continue to work with our colleagues in other states to ensure that all companies compete fairly with the knowledge that no one is above the law.'' Apple, in a statement, maintained its innocence and said it was still fighting the accusations through the appeal. ''We did nothing wrong and we believe a fair assessment of the facts will show it,'' said Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman. ''The iBooks Store has been good for consumers and the publishing industry as a whole, from well-known authors to first-time novelists. As we wait for the court to hear our appeal, we have agreed to a settlement, which is contingent on the outcome of the appeal. If we are vindicated by the appeals court, no settlement will be paid.'' Meanwhile, the publishing industry continues to feel pressure from Amazon, which is by far the biggest retailer in e-books. The latest struggle between publishers and Amazon erupted into the public sphere in May. Amazon had sought concessions on book sales from Hachette, the fourth-largest publisher, which the publisher was unwilling to give. So Amazon sought to get its way by delaying delivery of Hachette books.",

        "name": "Friendly giant, or relentless bully?; Amazon\u2019s push to upend the economics of reading has many writers on edge ",
        "content": " Vincent Zandri hails from the future. He is a novelist from the day after tomorrow, when Amazon has remade the worlds of writing, printing, selling and reading books so thoroughly that there is hardly anything left besides Amazon. Mr. Zandri, an author of mystery and suspense tales, is published by Thomas & Mercer, one of Amazon Publishing\u2019s many book imprints. He is edited by Amazon editors and promoted by Amazon publicists to Amazon customers, nearly all of whom read his books in electronic form on Amazon\u2019s e-readers, Amazon\u2019s tablets and, soon, Amazon\u2019s phones. His novels are not sold in bookstores, and rarely found in public libraries. His reviews are written by Amazon readers on the Amazon website. \u2018\u2018Has a little bit of something for everyone,\u2019\u2019 one enthusiast exclaimed. \u2018\u2018Heavy machinery, love, humor and mystery.\u2019\u2019 And his latest prize was an award from Amazon. It is the 21st-century equivalent of living in a company town, but Mr. Zandri, 50, is far from a downtrodden worker. A few years ago he was reduced to returning bottles and cans for grocery money. Now his Amazon earnings pay for lengthy stays in Italy and Paris, as well as expeditions to the real Amazon. \u2018\u2018I go wherever I want, do whatever I want and live however I want,\u2019\u2019 he said recently at a bar in Mill Valley, Calif., a San Francisco suburb where he was relaxing after a jaunt to Nepal. While Mr. Zandri celebrates Amazon as the best thing to happen to storytellers since the invention of movable type, many other writers are denouncing what they see as its bullying tendencies and an inclination toward monopoly. From household names to deeply obscure scribblers, authors are inflamed this summer, perhaps more deeply divided than at any point in nearly a half-century. Back then, it was the question of being a hawk or dove on Vietnam. Now it is not a war but an Internet retailer and its unparalleled grip on the cultural machinery that is provoking fierce controversy. At first, those in the publishing business considered Amazon a cute toy (you could see a book\u2019s exact sales ranking!) and a useful counterweight to Barnes & Noble and Borders, chains willing to throw their weight around. Now Borders is dead, Barnes & Noble is weak and Amazon owns the publishing platform of the digital era. The company founded and still run by Jeff Bezos dragged the publishers into modern times, forced them to digitize and urged on the United States Justice Department in its 2012 antitrust suit against the publishers and Apple. The conflict is unrelenting. The latest struggle between publishers and Amazon burst into public view two months ago, after the company began seeking concessions on book sales from Hachette, the fourth-largest publisher, which Hachette was unwilling to give. Amazon sought to get its way by delaying delivery of Hachette books, which roused Hachette\u2019s authors. At this point, Hachette is losing sales and Amazon is reaping a considerable amount of bad publicity. All of this angst and arguing is pushing forward a question: Is the resistance to Amazon a last-ditch bid to keep the future of American literary culture out of the hands of a rapacious corporation that calls books \u2018\u2018demand-weighted units,\u2019\u2019 or an effort by a bunch of dead-enders and snobs to forestall a future that will be much better for most readers and writers? Mr. Zandri, who 15 years ago had a $235,000 contract with a big New York house that went sour, has an answer. \u2018\u2018Everything Amazon has promised me, it has fulfilled \u2014 and more,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018They ask: \u2018Are you happy, Vince? We just want to see you writing books.\u2019 That\u2019s the major difference between corporate-driven Big Five publishers, where the writer is not the most important ingredient in the soup, and Amazon Publishing, which places its writers on a pedestal.\u2019\u2019 It sounds alluring. This is the siren call of the modern tech colossus, not just Amazon but Google, Apple and Facebook \u2014 companies with bottomless pocketbooks and infinite ambitions: We\u2019re building a better world. It will be dedicated to fulfilling all your needs and desires, including the ones you didn\u2019t even know you had. Trust us. \u2018Ruthlessly efficient\u2019 Amazon offers a vast array of goods. It is easy to order from. It is inexpensive. Everything arrives promptly. Customers love it. To no one\u2019s surprise, Amazon is now one of the 10 biggest retailers in the United States, edging out the 99-year-old Safeway grocery chain. Things are cheap for a reason, however. Inspired by Walmart, Amazon takes a famously hard line toward the people who make the stuff it sells. \u2018\u2018Amazon is not evil, but it is ruthlessly, ruthlessly efficient,\u2019\u2019 said Andrew Rhomberg, founder of Jellybooks, an ook discovery site. \u2018\u2018As consumers, we love Amazon\u2019s efficiency and low prices,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018But as suppliers, it is a toad that is hard to swallow.\u2019\u2019 For Hachette, which publishes under the Little Brown and Grand Central imprints, the latest proposal was more elephant than toad. Both parties have declined to say exactly what Amazon is asking; the general belief is that it wants to increase its share of revenue on every e-book to 50 percent from 30 percent. Amazon believes that publishers take too much of the money in producing a book and add too little value. In traditional publishing, the highest royalty a writer could get was 15 percent of the book\u2019s price. With e-books, the royalty is 25 percent of net revenue, but Amazon feels that is still not enough. Mr. Zandri gets 35 percent, and self-published writers who use Amazon\u2019s platform get more. \u2018\u2018Amazon believes the value exchange between publishers and authors is fundamentally broken,\u2019\u2019 said Scott Jacobson, who worked on the Kindle team at Amazon and is now at the Madrona Venture Group. \u2018\u2018In a world where authors can hire their own editors, market their books through the web and social media, and get production and distribution through Amazon or other services, publishers will play a lesser role and their share of the economics will be diminished.\u2019\u2019 So writers should get more and publishers less, an assertion with which few writers would disagree. But Amazon also wants books to be cheap. This makes the pie smaller for everyone; Amazon argues that publishers will make up on volume what they lose on each sale. In interviews, for the first time, executives from Amazon and Hachette explicitly described their positions. \u2018\u2018If you charge high e-book prices, ultimately what you\u2019re doing is making a slow, painful slide to irrelevancy,\u2019\u2019 said Russell Grandinetti, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for Kindle. \u2018\u2018You have to draw the box big. Books don\u2019t just compete against books. Books compete against Candy Crush, Twitter, Facebook, streaming movies, newspapers you can read for free. It\u2019s a new world. It\u2019s so important not to simply build a moat around the industry the way it is now.\u2019\u2019 Amazon favors a price of $9.99 for many e-book titles, while Hachette and other publishers want to charge more. Sixty percent of Hachette\u2019s e-book sales in the United States occur on Amazon. \u2018\u2018For most books, $9.99 creates more total revenue than $14.99,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Grandinetti said. \u2018\u2018That means $9.99 creates more total dollars to share with authors.\u2019\u2019 Amazon also argues that publishers like Hachette are ungrateful. They are generally doing well now, thanks to the fact that e-book income is bolstering their bottom line. And who made that e-book income possible? \u2018\u2018The truth is, Hachette is making dramatically larger profits on digital sales in large part thanks to Kindle, which has led the book business to a very healthy transition to digital, perhaps uniquely among media,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Grandinetti said. Hachette says Amazon is merely trying to plug the holes in its bottom line. \u2018\u2018This controversy shouldn\u2019t be misinterpreted,\u2019\u2019 said Michael Pietsch, chief executive of the Hachette Book Group. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s all about Amazon trying to make more money.\u2019\u2019 He noted that Amazon was also trying to squeeze a large publishing group in Germany, Bonnier, for better terms. And Germany has fixed-price laws for books. That, Mr. Pietsch said, \u2018\u2018is evidence that Amazon\u2019s margins, not lower prices for consumers, are the crux here.\u2019\u2019 Shares of Amazon have been under pressure this year. Amazon\u2019s ambitions are not prompting the sort of unrestrained excitement on Wall Street that they used to. \u2018\u2018You always hear about never wanting to fight a two-front war,\u2019\u2019 said John Rossman, a former Amazon executive. \u2018\u2018Well, Amazon is fighting a five-front war. They are investing in faster delivery, in a phone, in streaming video. And they need more profits so they can continue their investments. That\u2019s why there is a lot of pressure and negotiation.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Pietsch implied that Amazon was becoming desperate. \u2018\u2018You can\u2019t blame shareholders for demanding, at long last, a normal return on their investment,\u2019\u2019 he said. He added that even as Amazon was publicly accusing Hachette of refusing to negotiate last week, the publisher was putting its third proposal on the table, \u2018\u2018by far the most generous to date.\u2019\u2019 A deal soon would not be a surprise. A changing world It wasn\u2019t always this hard for Amazon to bend publishers to its will. A decade ago, when all books were physical, Amazon would run the numbers on its suppliers and would notice that one publisher was out of line \u2014 perhaps not paying the same amount to Amazon to promote its titles as some of its peers. So Amazon would talk with the publisher, try to make it see reason. Sometimes it did not. Publishers were arrogant back then, said Randy Miller, who worked at Amazon from 1999 to 2006. \u2018\u2018A lot of people had been in business for 30 years,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018They said: \u2018This is what we\u2019re going to publish, this is the price, you have no leverage, we control the content.\u2019\u2019\u2019 They had no clue that the world was changing. If a publisher did not give Amazon what it wanted, some of its books might disappear from the site. The writers would go wild. \u2018\u2018There were particular authors \u2014 we\u2019d meet with them, have dinner with them \u2014 and they\u2019d say, \u2018I always check Amazon to see where my book is,\u2019\u2019\u2019 Mr. Miller said. \u2018\u2018They\u2019d do it over their morning coffee. So you knew.\u2019\u2019 Among the buttons Amazon could push: raise the price, recommend something cheaper, make the book disappear from promotional lists. \u2018\u2018If I pull you out of recommendations, customers aren\u2019t going to see you at all,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Miller, who remembers doing just that as the executive in charge of buying operations and vendor management for Europe. \u2018\u2018It was the equivalent of a physical store putting you back by the discounted gardening equipment, where no one will ever find you.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Miller recalled a publisher taking six months to give in after this sort of treatment, which, he stressed, Amazon undertook only rarely. Others saw the light faster. \u2018\u2018An author would see his ranking drop from 98 to 798, and the first thing he\u2019d do is call his agent or publisher and say, \u2018What happened?\u2019\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018He held the publisher responsible and expected it to straighten this out.\u2019\u2019 In the Hachette dispute, authors are also bent out of shape, but see the villain this time as Amazon. And they are complaining on Twitter and Facebook. As Mr. Miller put it, \u2018\u2018It seems like every day another author gets a torch and heads to the castle.\u2019\u2019 This month, an unhappy group of writers issued a petition portraying the retailer as inconveniencing and misleading its own customers in the dispute, and thus \u2018\u2018contradicting its own written promise to be \u2018Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company.\u2019\u2019\u2019 In an emotional plea, the writers go on to accuse Amazon of betrayal. \u2018\u2018This is no way to treat a business partner,\u2019\u2019 says the petition, which has been signed by big-name authors like Stephen King and Robert Caro. \u2018\u2018Nor is it the right way to treat your friends.\u2019\u2019 All of that criticism puts Amazon, which is positioning itself as the authors\u2019 champion, in an awkward position. Last week, the retailer issued a sharply worded statement that Hachette \u2018\u2018should stop using their authors as human shields.\u2019\u2019 \u2018Waiting for Moses\u2019 Smaller publishers are watching the standoff with anxiety, if not outright dread. \u2018\u2018I feel as if we\u2019re seeing a shift in the paradigm of publishing right before our very eyes,\u2019\u2019 said Marlie Wasserman, director of Rutgers University Press. With titles like \u2018\u2018Queering Marriage: Challenging Family Formation in the United States\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Embodying Culture: Pregnancy in Japan and Israel,\u2019\u2019 Rutgers books tended to be invisible before Amazon. \u2018\u2018Amazon has democratized shelf space,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Wasserman said. \u2018\u2018In the last five years, not a single author complained to me that he couldn\u2019t find his books at a physical store. That\u2019s not where the action is anymore. I have to consider this every time I hear that Amazon is a bully.\u2019\u2019 Amazon is now responsible for 72 percent of Rutgers\u2019s e-book sales, and a third of its $3 million in annual revenue. If only the retailer were a little easier to deal with: At Rutgers, as with most presses, communicating with Amazon means communicating through a web interface. There is no sense there is a person at the other end. \u2018\u2018We still pride ourselves on what we are doing \u2014 producing books that educate and create a public good,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Wasserman said. \u2018\u2018To see that migrate into the hands of people who might not share our mission, or might not even be people, doesn\u2019t say much for the future of American culture.\u2019\u2019 Academic houses traditionally sell their books, which are labor-intensive and printed in small quantities, for smaller discounts than general publishers do. Amazon will have none of that. \u2018\u2018I offered them a 30 percent discount, and they demanded 40,\u2019\u2019 said Karen Christensen of Berkshire Publishing, a small academic house in Great Barrington, Mass. Amazon, as usual, got what it wanted. Then it asked for 45 percent. \u2018\u2018Where do I find that 5 percent?\u2019\u2019 Ms. Christensen asked. \u2018\u2018Amazon may be able to operate at a loss, but I\u2019m not in a position to do that.\u2019\u2019 Ms. Christensen, like other publishers, complains that Amazon is very inventive with fees and charges that rapidly add up. But at the same time, Amazon has made itself essential to Berkshire, which publishes a three-volume dictionary of Chinese biography that sells for $595. Amazon is responsible for about 15 percent of Berkshire\u2019s business. Ms. Christensen feels that she can\u2019t leave Amazon but fears what else it might ask. \u2018\u2018I wake up every single day knowing Amazon might make new, impossible demands,\u2019\u2019 she said. Amazon has been reported to be seeking a new concession from publishers: If a customer orders a book and it is not immediately available, it wants the right to print the volume itself. An Amazon spokesman said it does not compel publishers to use the technology but offers it as a service. The customer wants the book immediately, so this makes obvious sense. But it chips away yet again at the publisher\u2019s role. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re all sort of looking around now, waiting for Moses,\u2019\u2019 said another university press director. As a measure of the anxiety inspired by Amazon, he was unwilling to make a statement as mild as this on the record. Moses would somehow make the Amazon juggernaut stumble, preserving the good parts while getting rid of the bad. Another antitrust suit, this time supporting the publishers rather than going after them, might fill the bill nicely. \u2018\u2018I can see the emotional argument against Amazon, but I have a hard time seeing it prevail in court,\u2019\u2019 said Geoffrey A. Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law and Economics in Portland, Ore. \u2018\u2018The argument that there is an appropriate number of competitors, and one is not it, almost never flies in the United States.\u2019\u2019 American publishers and booksellers are looking longingly at France, where different rules apply. In late June, the French Senate unanimously passed a law forbidding free shipping on books bought online. It was called the anti-Amazon law. \u2018Soon, Amazon Mars\u2019 Three weeks ago, just before he went to Nepal, Mr. Zandri signed a contract with Amazon for a new novel, \u2018\u2018Everything Burns.\u2019\u2019 His $30,000 advance was immediately deposited in his bank account. By this point, he said, he is earning about what a junior lawyer makes at a big firm. Call it a comfortable six figures annually. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s traditional publishing, but better, with a higher royalty rate,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m published by Amazon France, Amazon Germany, Amazon India. Soon, Amazon Mars.\u2019\u2019 The company sent him a free Kindle, and now he gets most of his books from Amazon. Most of the movies he watches come from the site as well. \u2018\u2018Amazon touches every bit of my life,\u2019\u2019 he said. Mr. Zandri is so embedded in Amazon that he recently started wondering about it. Two years ago, he wrote about publishers on his blog: \u2018\u2018I know I\u2019m supposed to cry for these people, but they had a chance to survive and in fact thrive in today\u2019s digital book publishing world, but they haven\u2019t. And now they are going the way of the eight-track. Bon voyage.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s not that simple anymore. \u2018\u2018Publishing is a shyster business,\u2019\u2019 he reflected. \u2018\u2018One day it\u2019s \u2018You rock, bro,\u2019 and the next day they\u2019re not returning your calls. If I\u2019m not moving books on Amazon, they\u2019re not going to ask me back. It\u2019s not a charity.\u2019\u2019 Amazon looks so good because it has the rest of publishing to compete against. But if those publishers wither, maybe that would not be true. Mr. Zandri can even conceive of publishing with a New York house again. They still provide some forms of legitimacy that Amazon does not, with independent reviews and a presence in bookstores. So in the Amazon-Hachette dispute, somewhat to his surprise, he is on no one\u2019s side. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t agree that the entire dismantling of the traditional publishing world in New York is the answer,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018No one wants to hand Amazon a monopoly. I\u2019d be a fool to assume the good times will last forever.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " CORRECTION APPENDEDFrom its frontier infancy through the mid-20th century, the only Las Vegas was downtown Las Vegas. But the city center known as Glitter Gulch lost the glamour battle post-1960 with the newer Strip, a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard South with room for massive resorts featuring Egyptian pyramids and dancing water fountains. From a visitor's perspective, downtown became the seedy place to lose your money more slowly (and guard your wallet) at the $2 blackjack tables. But local politicians, entrepreneurs and preservationists never gave up on downtown, and when Zappos, the dot-com shoe dealer, moved from suburban Henderson to central Sin City in 2013, the business jolt revitalized the neighborhood, now the hippest in town. ''Las Vegas is always remaking itself,'' said Mark Brandenburg, president and an owner of Golden Gate Hotel & Casino downtown (goldengatecasino.com), which was built in 1906 and remodeled in 2012. ''We're still where Las Vegas started, but now with a rebirth of casinos and retail and the arrival of Tony Hsieh.'' Mr. Hsieh is the chief executive of Zappos who had the 1973-vintage City Hall adapted as the company's headquarters, and acquired about 100 parcels of surrounding land as part of a personal $350 million investment known as the Downtown Project. It has funded everything from a retail park to a school, health center and several small business start-ups. By the time Zappos arrived, a certain amount of reclamation was already underway, including the Beat Coffeehouse and Records (thebeatlv.com) where you can have a latte while listening to Simon and Garfunkel on scratchy vinyl and think you're in Portland. In 2012, several cultural draws debuted, including the Mob Museum (themobmuseum.org), which tackles Las Vegas's shady past, and the Neon Museum (neonmuseum.org), preserving over 150 pieces of castoff signage. Sensing a turnaround, new investors snapped up aging properties. The former Lady Luck opened as the 650-room Downtown Grand Hotel and Casino (downtowngrand.com) last fall, with a lively rooftop pool club. A block away, the D hotel(thed.com) transformed the old Fitzgerald's in 2012, but stowed its vintage slot machines -- including those with movable arms -- on the second floor for history buffs. Where the pedestrian portion of the carnivalesque Fremont Street ends at Las Vegas Boulevard, the new hipster Las Vegas begins. The best way to get a feel for neo-Vegas is to take the Downtown Project tour (downtownproject.com), a free 75-minute overview that takes place almost entirely in Mr. Hsieh's rambling private apartment on the 23rd floor of the Ogden apartment building. My guide, Heidy Stamper, ''the pixie of positivity for the Downtown Project,'' as she introduced herself, sporting hair dyed in rainbow colors, led eight mostly local guests through Mr. Hsieh's crowded living room to a window-walled work space with panoramic views over the project's 60 acres. She told the story of ''how a search for a new campus for Zappos'' turned into a new urbanism model based on community interaction, rather than corporate isolation. The project's most visible addition is the new Downtown Container Park (downtowncontainerpark.com), a square block ringed in repurposed shipping containers filled with boutiques and restaurants that surround a central play area for children (a decidedly new demographic downtown) featuring a fanciful treehouse with a four-story slide. Here you can buy artist-designed decals at Lil' Art Bodega, pick up locally made beef jerky at JoJo's Jerky or dine on pulled pork sandwiches at Big Ern's BBQ while listening to a musical act at the outdoor stage. ''There was no real shopping down here before,'' said Brandi Allen, an owner of the new tenant 702DTLV, a fashion and accessories boutique. ''We've had awesome turnout, and most of our traffic is local.'' Two blocks away, the 200-seat Inspire Theater (frglv.com) opened in February as a showcase for everything from indie bands to burlesque acts. It contains a coffee shop on the ground floor with an arty newsstand, a low-key jazz bar called Wayfarer and a just-opened rooftop bar, the Roof. The venues are operated by Future Restaurant Group, owned by Michael Cornthwaite. Mr. Cornthwaite and his wife, Jennifer, originally helped show Mr. Hsieh around downtown Las Vegas. His investment ''gave downtown a shock,'' said Ms. Cornthwaite, the spokeswoman for the company. ''It could have been a 20-year evolution.'' Instead, like a lucky pull on a throwback slot machine, downtown's revival happened virtually overnight. Correction: July 20, 2014, Sunday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the revival of downtown Las Vegas misstated the year that Zappos, the dot-com shoe dealer, moved there and revitalized the neighborhood. It was in 2013, not 2012. In addition, the article misspelled the name of a street in the city. It is Fremont Street, not Freemont.

        "content": " In some ways, this was not the best week for Amazon. The Federal Trade Commission sued it for improperly billing customers for games used by their children. And it continues to be enmeshed in a nasty public relations battle with the publisher Hachette. But Amazon still has the drones. In a filing with the Federal Aviation Administration that got widespread attention Friday, Amazon asked for permission to test its drone delivery system outdoors, a practice that is banned for safety reasons. Never mind for the moment the fact that the F.A.A. said a few weeks ago that there would be no commercial uses of drones in a memo that did not mention Amazon but pointedly excluded even the free shipping of items by drone. That's a lobbying battle for another day. Delivery by drone was first mentioned by Amazon last year on ''60 Minutes,'' and quickly became a viral sensation despite, or because of, the fact that it was unlikely to happen anytime soon. If nothing else, it was a vivid demonstration of Amazon's gift for showmanship. In the filing to Michael P. Huerta, the F.A.A. administrator, Amazon said that it should get an exemption from the rules because of the ''enormous consumer benefits'' of what it is calling Prime Air: getting stuff to people quickly. Amazon said that if it did not get what it wanted, it would have to move the drone team to another country. ''Of course, Amazon would prefer to keep the focus, jobs and investment of this important research and development initiative in the United States,'' the letter said. Amazon stock shot up Friday faster than a you know what, jumping more than 5 percent. It was either the power of the drone or analysts' reports predicting a good second quarter.",

Amazon's mobile store, the suit states, introduced the ability to bill customers within an application -- so-called in-app charges -- in November 2011, and did so without parental notifications or password requirements in children's games. Often, the charges were for digital goods like coins, clothing, clues or tools that help a player progress through a game. Jessica Rich, director of the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a conference call on Thursday that Amazon's approach resulted in ''sticking parents with unexpected bills in the hundreds of dollars.'' Ms. Rich said the charges led to ''thousands of complaints that we know of.'' In the discovery phase of its suit, she said, more complaints are likely to surface and the agency will be able to estimate more precisely the purportedly improper charges. Apple faced similar accusations about its app store, and it settled with the F.T.C. in January, agreeing to better ensure parental approval of purchases and to pay at least $32.5 million in refunds to customers. In the conference call, agency officials said they could not comment on private negotiations with Amazon and why no settlement had been reached. But Ms. Rich said the F.T.C.'s goals in both the Apple and Amazon cases had been to seek full refunds and require informed consent. In the Amazon case, the agency is striving for an outcome ''similar to the settlement with Apple,'' Ms. Rich said. Last month, the F.T.C. informed Amazon that it planned to sue, unless the company agreed to a consent order modeled after the Apple settlement. In a letter, dated July 1 and addressed to Edith Ramirez, the F.T.C. chairwoman, Andrew DeVore, associate general counsel of Amazon, criticized the agency's ''unwillingness to depart from the precedent it set with Apple.'' The Amazon case, Mr. DeVore wrote, involved ''very different facts,'' so the company had ''no choice but to defend our approach in court.'' After Amazon introduced in-app charges in late 2011, Mr. DeVore wrote, the company made several improvements. Yet even from the outset, he insisted, its approach was ''responsible, customer-focused and lawful.'' In its suit, the F.T.C. rebuts that claim. The filing cites internal Amazon communications in December 2011 from an app store manager saying the in-app charges with few restraints were ''clearly causing problems for a large percentage of our customers.'' The manager called the situation a ''near house on fire.'' Amazon declined to comment beyond Mr. DeVore's letter. Amazon has made a series of changes to its in-app purchases program. In March 2012, the company required a password for individual charges of more than $20, though it allowed unlimited purchases below that threshold, the F.T.C. complaint said. Further restrictions came later. But the complaint said that it was not until June 2014, shortly before the commission voted to approve the suit, that Amazon changed its in-app purchase program to really obtain informed parental consent. That, Ms. Rich noted, was roughly two and a half years after the problem surfaced. During that time, she said, parents who sought refunds faced an Amazon process that was ''unclear and rife with deterrents.'' Jessica Rich of the F.T.C.'s consumer protection bureau.

        "name": "Cloud Computing Giants Add to Open Source Credentials With Kubernetes ",
        "content": " A modest and geeky announcement by Google and a couple other big tech names on Thursday may be the summer\u2019s biggest development in a continuing fight over the future of huge global computing. Microsoft, IBM and Red Hat, along with others, are joining Google in creating open source software to manage computing workloads across thousands of computer servers. Amazon Web Services, by far the largest cloud computing company, was notably absent from the announcement. Called  Kubernetes , the software project draws on a former Google top secret: how the search giant efficiently built and deployed powerful applications like search, mail and maps over its cloud computing system, one of the world\u2019s largest. What Google kept proprietary it now hopes to sell to thousands of companies around the world as part of renting the public its computing power. So do Microsoft and IBM, with public clouds that chief executives at both companies say are crucial to their futures. Red Hat is a leading provider of services for the Linux computer operating system, which is used extensively in cloud servers. \u201cSome of the biggest enterprises in the world are throwing their hats into the ring,\u201d said Miles Ward, an executive with Google Cloud Platform, Google\u2019s cloud computing business. \u201cWe have built a stupefying amount of software using this.\u201d Soon, he said, the rest of the world will, too. Kubernetes may also prove useful in smaller cloud systems operated by private companies, in particular for deploying applications and bridging private and public clouds. \u201cWe are big believers, long term, in public clouds,\u201d Mr. Ward said, \u201cbut there is still a couple trillion dollars in gear sitting around doing computing inside companies.\u201d That such computing infrastructure might be needed by a typical company says a lot about the scale of resources expected to be commonplace once things like big data analysis and managing billions of connected devices become commonplace in corporations. That Google and others will donate such things free may say even more about the competitive environment. At almost the same time as the Kubernetes announcement, Amazon Web Services was having a large meeting in New York, marketing its version of cloud computing, which downplays the idea that companies should even have their own data centers. So far, that approach has worked well, but Google, Microsoft and IBM are all pushing variants on a hybrid model. \u201cOther companies say that everything is going to the public cloud \u2014 not in my lifetime,\u201d said Paul Cormier, president of products and technology at Red Hat. \u201cRed Hat and Google see things going in the same direction.\u201d In an email, an Amazon spokeswoman said that the web service had its own management system for workloads, which automates most functions efficiently. She declined to comment on the competitive environment or whether Amazon\u2019s would follow its competitors into a hybrid business. There is another way in which the announcement could rock the status quo. Kubernetes manages so-called \u201ccontainers\u201d inside the cloud, used for running different applications. The idea is to use the computing power in each of a cloud\u2019s processing units, sometimes hundreds of thousands of computing nodes, as efficiently as possible. Google says it runs   more than two billion containers a week for its services. In this sense, containers are an improvement on virtualization, a means of increasing the efficiency of individual servers that remade the computer business a decade ago. Twitter and Airbnb already use an open source container software, called  Mesos , to run applications. That suggests that, in the long run, well-managed containers could also prove a threat to virtualization, a money maker for both Microsoft and VMware, a multibillion-dollar subsidiary of the data storage giant EMC. \u201cVirtualization no longer makes sense,\u201d said Florian Leibert, co-founder and chief executive of  Mesosphere , a container management company that is also working on the Kubernetes project. \u201cThis is the way to run computing at a big scale.\u201d Jason Zander, corporate vice president of Microsoft\u2019s cloud business, said his company expected to keep using virtualization, as well as the bigger types of systems. \u201cThis won\u2019t replace virtual machines,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be a spectrum of solutions.\u201d In an email, a VMware spokesman said the company thinks its customers are \u201cthinking/wanting to figure out how to utilize containers within their existing VMware context.\u201d",

        "name": "The French do buy books. Real books. ",
        "content": " One of the maddening things about being a foreigner in France is that hardly anyone in the rest of the world knows what\u2019s really happening here. They think Paris is a Socialist museum where people are exceptionally good at eating small bits of chocolate and tying scarves. In fact, the French have all kinds of worthwhile ideas on larger matters. This occurred to me recently when I was strolling through my museum-like neighborhood in central Paris, and realized there were \u2014 I kid you not \u2014 seven bookstores within a 10-minute walk of my apartment. Granted, I live in a bookish area. But still: Do the French know something about the book business that we Americans don\u2019t? I was in a bookstore-counting mood because of the news that Amazon has delayed or stopped delivering some books, over its dispute with the publisher Hachette. This has prompted soul-searching over Amazon\u2019s 41 percent share of new book sales in America and its 65 percent share of new books sold online. For a few bucks off and the pleasure of shopping from bed, have we handed over a precious natural resource \u2014 our nation\u2019s books \u2014 to an ambitious billionaire with an engineering degree? France, meanwhile, has just unanimously passed a so-called anti-Amazon law, which says online sellers can\u2019t offer free shipping on discounted books. (\u2018\u2018It will be either cheese or dessert, not both at once,\u2019\u2019 a French commentator explained.) The new measure is part of France\u2019s effort to promote \u2018\u2018biblio-diversity\u2019\u2019 and help independent bookstores compete. Here, there\u2019s no big bookseller with the power to suddenly turn off the spigot. People in the industry estimate that Amazon has a 10 or 12 percent share of new book sales in France. Amazon reportedly handles 70 percent of the country\u2019s online book sales, but just 18 percent of books are sold online. The French secret is deeply un-American: fixed book prices. Its 1981 \u2018\u2018Lang law,\u2019\u2019 named after former Culture Minister Jack Lang, says that no seller can offer more than 5 percent off the cover price of new books. That means a book costs more or less the same wherever you buy it in France, even online. The Lang law was designed to make sure France continues to have lots of different books, publishers and booksellers. Fixing book prices may sound shocking to Americans, but it\u2019s common around the world, for the same reason. In Germany, retailers aren\u2019t allowed to discount most books at all. Six of the world\u2019s 10 biggest book-selling countries \u2014 Germany, Japan, France, Italy, Spain and South Korea \u2014 have versions of fixed book prices. Even with the state\u2019s help, French bookstores are struggling. Xavier Moni, co-owner of Comme Un Roman in Paris, says he can afford to give 5 percent off only every 10th purchase. More important than free shipping, he and others say, is that despite having extensive operations in France and elsewhere in Europe, Amazon pays taxes in Luxembourg, where corporate taxes are effectively low and in some cases largely avoidable. The European Union has begun an inquiry into Amazon\u2019s taxes. Still, there does seem to be a link between fixed book prices and flourishing \u2014 or at least still-breathing \u2014 independent bookstores. In Britain, which abandoned its own fixed-price system in the 1990s, there are fewer than 1,000 independent bookstores left. A third closed in the past nine years, as supermarkets and Amazon discounted some books by more than 50 percent. \u2018\u2018You\u2019d have to be almost masochistic to go into a bookseller in the U.K. to buy a best seller,\u2019\u2019 Dougal Thomson of the International Publishers Association says. What underlies France\u2019s book laws isn\u2019t just an economic position \u2014 it\u2019s also a worldview. Quite simply, the French treat books as special. Some 70 percent of French people said they read at least one book last year; the average among French readers was 15 books. Readers say they trust books far more than any other medium, including newspapers and TV. The French government classifies books as an \u2018\u2018essential good,\u2019\u2019 along with electricity, bread and water. (A French friend of mine runs a charity, Libraries Without Borders, which brings books to survivors of natural disasters.) \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t force French people to go to bookstores,\u2019\u2019 explains Vincent Montagne, head of the French Publishers Association. \u2018\u2018They go to bookstores because they read.\u2019\u2019 None of this is taken for granted. People here have thought for centuries about what makes a book industry vibrant, and are watching developments in Britain and America as cautionary tales. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t sell potatoes,\u2019\u2019 says Mr. Moni. \u2018\u2018There are also ideas in books. That\u2019s what\u2019s dangerous. Because the day that you have a large seller that sells 80 percent of books, he\u2019s the one who will decide what\u2019s published, or what won\u2019t be published. That\u2019s what scares me.\u2019\u2019 The French aren\u2019t being pretentious or fetishizing bookstores. They\u2019re giving voice to something we know in America, too. \u2018\u2018When your computer dies, you throw it away,\u2019\u2019 says Mr. Montagne of the publishers\u2019 association. \u2018\u2018But you\u2019ll remember a book 20 years later. You\u2019ve deeply entered into a story that\u2019s not your own. It\u2019s forged who you are. You\u2019ll only see later how much it has affected you. You don\u2019t keep all books, but it\u2019s not a market like others. The contents of a bookcase can define who you are.\u2019\u2019 The main thing my bookcase says about me is that I\u2019m not French. While I love walking past those beautifully lit bookstores in my neighborhood, what I mostly buy there are blank notebooks and last-minute presents for children\u2019s birthdays. Online retailers are a godsend for stranded expatriates. Like people everywhere who are fretting about Amazon\u2019s global domination, I want to have my g\u00e2teau and eat it, too: the option to buy online, but the pleasure of browsing in a shop. And I don\u2019t want every book purchase to feel like a political statement. French people like having books delivered to their doorsteps, too, and they\u2019re starting to read more e-books (which are currently just 3 percent of the book market). Indeed, despite all their old-fashioned bookstores, they are aiming for something that sounds quite American: choice (here they call it \u00e9quilibre \u2014 balance). Unlike us, they might actually get it.",

        "content": " The confrontation between Amazon and Hachette is growing louder and meaner, as the combatants drop all pretense that this is a reasonable dispute among reasonable people. Amazon has proposed giving Hachette's authors all the revenue from their e-book sales on Amazon as the parties continue to negotiate a new contract. Hachette's response on Tuesday was to suggest that the retailer was trying to make it commit suicide. ''We call baloney,'' the retailer fired back. It is rare to see billion-dollar conglomerates engage in this sort of invective. Amazon, in particular, was famous until very recently for saying as little as possible in the media. But as the dispute has dragged on, it is trying a new tactic. For more than six months, Amazon has been trying to wring better e-book terms out of Hachette. The publisher, which is the fourth largest in the United States and whose imprints include Little Brown and Grand Central Publishing, is energetically resisting. Amazon has responded by delaying shipments of Hachette books and making it harder for customers to order them. Hachette authors have responded by publicly excoriating Amazon. With its newest proposal, Amazon is trying to break the impasse by getting Hachette's writers to switch allegiances. That would take the heat off Amazon, which has never suffered as much sustained criticism as it is getting now. Which might also be the reason Hachette summarily rejected it. The offer came in a letter to a few writers and agents from David Naggar, an Amazon executive who works with publishers and independent authors. It proposes ''a big windfall for authors'' by taking them ''out of the middle'' of the conflict. On Tuesday, Amazon sent the proposal to Hachette itself. The proposal ''has several real benefits -- to motivate us and Hachette to reach an agreement sooner rather than later and to insulate the authors,'' said Russ Grandinetti, Amazon's senior vice president for Kindle content. ''It would make things better for readers, too,'' he added. But Roxana Robinson, president of the Authors Guild, dismissed the proposal. ''If Amazon wants to have a constructive conversation about this, we're ready to have one at any time,'' she said in an email. ''But this seems like a short-term solution that encourages authors to take sides against their publishers. It doesn't get authors out of the middle of this -- we're still in the middle.'' The standoff has prompted a debate over the future of books, reading and American culture. Many mainstream writers have rallied to Hachette's side, tweeting and editorializing and blogging against Amazon. Hundreds of writers, including Stephen King and John Grisham, have signed a petition, which maintains it is not taking sides but is clearly directed at Amazon. ''We encourage Amazon in the strongest possible terms to stop harming the livelihood of the authors on whom it has built its business,'' it says. ''None of us, neither readers nor authors, benefit when books are taken hostage.'' But Amazon has its own constituency. About 6,500 writers who use its system to publish their books have come up with their own petition on Change.org. ''Major publishers like Hachette have a long history of treating authors and readers poorly,'' the petition proclaims. ''Amazon, on the other hand, has built its reputation on valuing authors and readers dearly.'' In Mr. Naggar's letter, Amazon took the opportunity to portray Hachette as unwilling to compromise or even talk to the retailer. ''We heard nothing from them for three full months,'' it says. ''After our last proposal to them on June 5, they waited a week to respond at all, promising a counteroffer the following week. We are still waiting a month later.'' It added, ''Unless Hachette dramatically changes their negotiating tempo, this is going to take a really long time.'' A Hachette executive familiar with the negotiations denied the publisher was unwilling to negotiate. ''We made an offer in April that was the largest we'd ever made any retailer, and in May made another that was higher still,'' said the executive, who refused to be quoted by name because of the negotiations. ''Both offers were rejected.'' On the evidence of their statements, the parties appear light-years apart. Amazon wanted to cut the publisher off entirely from ''its own revenue from e-books sold by Amazon, which would be a suicidal action,'' Hachette said. ''Once again, Amazon acknowledges that their unilateral actions, in trying to extract much higher terms from Hachette, are harming authors.'' Nonsense, Amazon responded. ''Hachette is part of a $10 billion global conglomerate,'' said Amazon, which will achieve $100 billion in revenue this year. ''It wouldn't be 'suicide.' They can afford it.'' Many writers are in a third camp. Ms. Robinson, whose books are not published by Hachette, said that ''what writers want is a long-term healthy publishing ecosystem, not a temporary windfall.'' That applies to both parties, she added. ''From our publishers we want a fairer share of e-book revenues; from Amazon we want an end to predatory practices that unfairly threaten their competitors, as well as the continued existence of the printed book.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. Roxana Robinson, president of the Authors Guild, rejected Amazon's proposal, saying that writers did not want a ''temporary windfall.''",

        "content": " LONDON \u2014 On weekends, Guillaume Rosquin browses the shelves of local bookstores in Lyon, France. He enjoys peppering the staff with questions about what he should be reading next. But his visits, he says, are also a protest against the growing power of Amazon. He is bothered by the way the American online retailer treats its warehouse employees. Still, as with millions of other Europeans, there is a limit to how much he will protest. \u201cIt depends on the price,\u201d said Mr. Rosquin, 49, who acknowledged that he was planning to buy a $400 BlackBerry smartphone on Amazon because the handset was not yet available on rival French websites. \u201cIf you can get something for half-price at Amazon, you may put your issues with their working conditions aside.\u201d Across Europe, love \u2014 or at least acceptance \u2014 often wins out in the love-hate relationship with American tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google. Despite their often vocal criticism of these behemoths, people in the region are some of the most active and loyal users of American social networks, search engines and ommerce websites. They are often even more hooked on the services than Americans are. Google now has an 85 percent market share   for search in the region\u2019s five largest economies, including Britain, France and Germany, compared with less than 80 percent in 2009, according to the research company comScore. Google\u2019s share of the American market stands at roughly 65 percent. Facebook \u2014  the target of several government investigations   for its tax practices in Europe \u2014 also has more than doubled its number of European users, to over 150 million, in the last five years, and the social network\u2019s European user numbers now outpace American figures, according to the social media research company eMarketer. American tech companies operate seven of the 10 most visited websites in Europe, according to comScore statistics. Only Yandex and Mail.ru, a Russian search engine and an email site, and Axel Springer, the German publisher of Die Welt and Bild, make the list. Nonetheless, from Spain to Sweden, many of Europe\u2019s millions of Internet users regularly complain about the dominance of American tech companies, particularly about how their data is used and shared. It also leaves them wondering why so few homegrown tech companies are globally competitive. For many Europeans, the likes of Twitter and Amazon hold too much information about what people do online. That wariness has only grown stronger after the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about American intelligence agencies\u2019 spying activities and perceived easy access to the world\u2019s tech infrastructure. In some ways, Europeans are pushing back. Last month, Google started removing some links to online search results after Europe\u2019s highest court ruled that the company had to give people the right to request that information be taken down. And the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is finishing new rules \u2014 tougher than those currently in force in the United States \u2014 intended to strengthen the region\u2019s privacy protections for online data. But leave the clutches of the services they deride? No. For Stuart Turnbull, 42, a writer who lives two hours north of Edinburgh, a reliance on American tech companies has become the cost of doing business. Mr. Turnbull once tried to shut down his Facebook account after realizing that he was spending too much time sharing posts and comments. Yet as he looked to build contacts with other writers and editors around the world, Mr. Turnbull, who works from a home office in the small town of Crieff, soon changed his mind. He even opened a second Facebook account dedicated to his literary career. While he remains concerned about how tech companies use his online data, the ability to tap into the global networks offered by the likes of Facebook and Twitter is too enticing a prospect to turn down. \u201cI accept that my data may be mined,\u201d said Mr. Turnbull, who says he is more worried about companies\u2019 potentially abusing his information than about governments\u2019 getting access to his online data. \u201cIt\u2019s the price you pay for using these so-called free services.\u201d In many ways, the American companies face little competition. For example, several regional e-commerce sites like the British fashion company ASOS have challenged Amazon but have yet to compete with the breadth of products \u2014 and discounts \u2014 offered by the American company. European social networks, particularly in Germany, once dominated online communication but gradually fell out of favor as Facebook\u2019s global reach grew. Government efforts, including a French plan to create a state-backed search engine to compete with Google, have also failed to take off. But not every European has succumbed to the dominance of the American tech companies. Six months ago, Russell Albert, a 43-year-old British software engineer, started thinking that the ads displayed next to his Google search results were too closely based on his Internet search history. He switched to using smaller, lesser-known search engines and began looking for alternatives to other Google products, like its popular email service. Surfing the web may not be as easy with these other services, Mr. Albert said, but he is still glad he switched. \u201cI hated being completely Googled up,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided that I didn\u2019t want to have all my eggs in just one basket.\u201d After  Facebook\u2019s purchase   of the messaging service WhatsApp, rumors abounded that European users of the messaging service would flee, fearing that Facebook would gain access to their personal information despite reassurances from the company that it would keep WhatsApp user data separate. Yet six months after the announcement of the deal,  WhatsApp says its user numbers   have increased to half a billion \u2014 many of them Europeans. Among them is Lara Goldsworthy, a 31-year-old marketing manager from Hamburg, Germany. \u201cWhatsApp would have been the first service that I would have left, but I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Ms. Goldsworthy, who added that many of her German friends \u2014 seemingly without irony \u2014 took to Facebook to complain about the social network\u2019s acquisition of the messaging service. \u201cI realized,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I had given up my privacy a long time ago.\u201d Google Reinstates European Links to Articles From The Guardian European Countries Seek More Taxes From U.S. Multinational Companies Guillaume Rosquin usually shops at local bookstores in Lyon, France, but said he would go to Amazon for lower prices. | Niels Ackermann for The New York Times | Russell Albert, a software engineer in London, said he stopped using Google products because of concerns about privacy. | Hazel Thompson for The New York Times",

        "content": " There has been much buzz about the initial public offering of Alibaba, China\u2019s e-commerce giant. The company is the top player in an increasingly crowded and diverse Chinese online sales market that features corporations looking to order large quantities of manufactured goods; small business buying items in lots of, say, 25 pieces; and consumers looking for a single product. The online market includes both local competitors like  DHGate , which sells goods for export from China, and international sites selling directly to Chinese consumers \u2014 including Amazon, which is beginning to gain mainland customers after a slow start. There are at least three major differences between American and Chinese online sales. Those differences illustrate both the challenges and the potential for growth in China. Quality and returns. Most American retailers guarantee their products against defects and allow returns for various reasons, including the buyer simply changing his or her mind. Chinese retailers rarely allow for this scenario, so buyers must be very sure of what they are purchasing before they click \u201cbuy.\u201d Also, while the sale of counterfeit products is rare in the United States, it is prevalent on Chinese sites. Buyers in China often pick an item with a midrange price instead of the lowest, because choosing the lowest price is seen as a tacit agreement to accept a knockoff. Delivery. Except in a few larger markets, delivery in the United States is rarely made on the same day, and it can involve big fees. It is easy to buy something for $4.95 and pay $10 to have it delivered. But in China, the efficient and inexpensive \u201ckuai di\u201d (pronounced KWHY-dee) express delivery services typically charge five to six renminbi \u2014 or less than $1 \u2014 payable in cash for same-day delivery. Buying something online is often both faster and cheaper than going to the corner store. Even businesses order big deliveries this way, leading to overloaded bicycles and electric scooters.

In America, online buyers often get most of the information about items they want to buy right on the merchant\u2019s website, through photos, user ratings, videos and other descriptive details. Knowing that they can return anything they don\u2019t like, buyers feel secure purchasing without further interaction with the seller. In China, most purchases \u2014 even very small ones \u2014 are discussed via telephone, email or chat before the purchase is made. Negotiations and modifications are made before the order is placed. The sales process often involves as much labor as it would if it were done on a retail floor \u2014 all while trying to compete at a discounted rate. I buy most of my groceries online whether I\u2019m in the United States or China. In America, the process takes 10 minutes, and groceries are delivered by the day\u2019s end. In China, the ordering is simple but always involves many subsequent back-and-forth phone calls with the company that fulfills the order. Simple items like bread or bottled water can generate a call to discuss substitutions of brand or bottle size I will accept. The follow-up calls typically take up an additional half-hour. I recently purchased a heating pad from an independent vendor on Taobao, an Alibaba site. After reviewing several options, I picked a midrange pad for about $16. It came promptly, and I happily snuggled in as it warmed up. Ten minutes later, it quit working. Disappointed, I turned instead to the hands of a very good and inexpensive masseuse. The next day, my office called the vendor. The representative apologized and sent me a replacement without requiring me to return the faulty product (much to the surprise of my team). I was encouraged and figured the initial item must have been a fluke. Two days later, after light use, the new pad also failed. One of my colleagues called the company again. This time, the representative said I was using it wrong and that the company would not do anything to correct the problem. I am now on my fifth heating pad in China. My continued efforts have become a running joke, but it illustrates the frustration that many buyers experience and expect with online retailers in China. The company\u2019s e-commerce market is now bigger than any in the United States, but all things aren\u2019t equal. As labor in China becomes more expensive, it is an open question whether online sellers can sustain the cost advantages that drove the explosive growth.

        "content": " In a backlash against the retail giant Amazon, France is preparing to impose new restrictions this summer that would bar online merchants from offering free shipments of discounted books. New legislation, designed to protect thousands of local bookstores, and nicknamed the anti-Amazon law, was passed last week by the French Senate. It will not formally take effect until after the president signs it, in the next two weeks. But the state's culture minister, Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti, has already publicly backed the measure, which has drawn support from conservative and liberal politicians. The minister called the ban ''a sign of the deep commitment of the nation to books.'' An Amazon spokeswoman in France declined to comment about the measure, which has its roots in the 1981 ''Lang Law.'' Then, the culture ministry created fixed prices to help independent bookstores compete with chains. It permits book discounts up to 5 percent, which Amazon was giving along with free shipments -- offers that politicians considered a competitive advantage. With the new measure, online booksellers can offer the same discount, but must charge for shipping. The passage of the law comes as Amazon is facing brush fires elsewhere from publishers in Germany, who accuse it of violating competition laws, and from editors in England who complain about new distribution terms that the company is imposing. With the French law, politicians like Brigitte Gonthier-Maurin, a senator, seized the opportunity to criticize the company for minimizing its taxes in its markets by setting up operations in Luxembourg.",

        "name": "Hachette adds heft to combat Amazon; Publisher set to acquire Perseus\u2019s imprints and strengthen books catalog ",
        "content": " Hachette Book Group is bulking up and diversifying, steps that could improve its long-term negotiating position with Amazon, the giant online retailer. The publisher said on Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire the Perseus Books Group, the country\u2019s sixth-largest trade publisher. Michael Pietsch, Hachette\u2019s chief executive, said in a phone interview that the deal was part of Hachette\u2019s \u2018\u2018strategic long-term plan to grow in the U.S. market,\u2019\u2019 and was not related to its monthslong standoff with Amazon over e-book pricing. Still, the acquisition could provide Hachette more leverage in its negotiations with Amazon because it will give the company control over more attractive books. It will also help Hachette diversify away from its dependence on fiction best sellers by adding more nonfiction and academic books, which are less dependent on Amazon for sales. (As a rule, fiction books sell more heavily in e-book form, which Amazon dominates, whereas nonfiction, academic and older books sell predominantly in print.) Perseus, which has 12 imprints including Da Capo Press, Basic Books and Avalon Travel, has strength in a wide range of nonfiction categories, such as history, science and travel. It has a stable of prestigious authors, including two Nobel Peace Prize recipients, Leymah Gbowee and Muhammad Yunus. And it also produces popular inspirational fare; recent best sellers include \u2018\u2018Finding Me,\u2019\u2019 the story of a woman held in captivity in Ohio for more than a decade, and \u2018\u2018The Gifts of Imperfection,\u2019\u2019 a self-improvement book. \u2018\u2018They have been the most best-seller-dependent of the big five \u2014 this is a quantum leap for them in university bookstores and libraries,\u2019\u2019 Mike Shatzkin, chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a publishing consulting firm, said of Hachette. \u2018\u2018The business they are best at is the highest-risk business, and this would give them a more stable and diverse base. In one fell swoop this broadens them enormously.\u2019\u2019 Perseus also owns a strong backlist of 6,000 titles, which includes perennial sellers like \u2018\u2018Friday Night Lights,\u2019\u2019 by Buzz Bissinger and \u2018\u2018Skinny Bitch\u2019\u2019 by Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin. Under the terms of the deal, Hachette would keep the Perseus publishing business, but it has signed a binding agreement to sell its distribution arm, including warehouses and sales force, to Ingram Content Group, a distributor. The price of the acquisition was not disclosed. Hachette\u2019s pricing dispute with Amazon has attracted much attention in the publishing world recently. As Amazon has grown to dominate the online book market, it has been demanding that publishers cut their prices and pay higher fees. Hachette has refused to meet Amazon\u2019s demands in the current round of negotiations. Amazon has responded with tactics that include refusing some presale orders on Hachette books, delaying the delivery of books and suggesting that readers try other authors instead. The moves have enraged Hachette authors, including the late-night host Stephen Colbert, who ranted against Amazon this month on his show. But Amazon has stood firm. The retailer\u2019s power in the book industry \u2014 it controls roughly one-third of the country\u2019s book business, and possibly more \u2014 has prompted publishers to move toward consolidation as they look to fortify their own negotiating positions by adding heft and larger inventory. Last year, Random House and Penguin merged into a giant publishing house, making it harder for Amazon not to carry their books. A merger of Perseus with Hachette, the fourth-largest publisher in the United States market, would result in a much smaller company than Penguin Random House. But it would offer a quick way for Hachette to strengthen its nonfiction offerings. (Hachette has been stronger in popular fiction \u2014 for example, it recently released \u2018\u2018The Silkworm\u2019\u2019 by J. K. Rowling, writing as Robert Galbraith.) Hachette has been looking to expand for a long time, and Perseus, a private company founded in 1996, was a logical target. The company has been growing quickly and had nearly $100 million in publishing sales revenue in the last year to reach record profits, according to David Steinberger, its chief executive. Mr. Steinberger will leave the company after the transaction is complete. Moreover, the distribution division \u2014 which provides back-end services like marketing to smaller independent publishers like Harvard Business Review Press \u2014 would seem to be an important factor in the success of Perseus\u2019s nonfiction titles. But that part of the business is going to Ingram.",

        "name": "Publishers in Germany join critics of Amazon; Formal complaint asks government to intercede as book shipments slow ",
        "content": " German book publishers have filed a complaint with the country\u2019s antitrust authority against Amazon, accusing the online retailer of violating competition laws, abusing its \u2018\u2018market dominant\u2019\u2019 position and asking the government to investigate. The 22-page formal complaint, filed last week but announced on Tuesday, comes nearly two months after Amazon began delaying shipments of titles from Bonnier, a leading publishing group in Germany, amid a dispute over dividing revenue from e-book sales. Amazon is engaged in a similar struggle with Hachette in the United States. \u2018\u2018Amazon\u2019s business conduct not only affects those publishers involved, but poses a danger to all who offer e-books in Germany,\u2019\u2019 read the complaint by the German Publishers and Booksellers Association. The group submitted its complaint to the Bundeskartellamt, the federal antitrust authority, on Friday. \u2018\u2018We call on the Bundeskartellamt to open an investigation and halt Amazon\u2019s actions,\u2019\u2019 the complaint said. Amazon did not respond on Tuesday to repeated requests for comment. Germany, the birthplace of modern printing technology, has a proud tradition of book publishing. Special laws intended to keep competition among booksellers to a minimum create an environment that makes it easier for lesser known authors to be published. But the cozy world of German publishing has been slow to adapt to the Internet age, whether in online sales or digital publishing. That has left a vacuum Amazon has swiftly moved to fill. The American company, according to industry estimates, controls as much as 70 percent of the German market for online sales of printed and electronic books. Germany is Amazon\u2019s largest market outside the United States, posting earnings of 1.9 billion euros, or $2.6 billion, last year. If the retailer were to be found guilty of violating German competition law, it could be fined or ordered to change its behavior. The Bundeskartellamt on Tuesday confirmed receipt of the complaint. After reviewing it, the government will decide whether there are sufficient grounds to find that Amazon held a market-dominant position and so can be investigated for potential antitrust violations. That process could take several weeks and hinges on whether the online market can be viewed as being independent from traditional brick-and-mortar bookshops. \u2018\u2018For the publishers,\u2019\u2019 the complaint said, \u2018\u2018it is indispensable to be listed on Amazon, as the largest selling platform for books on the Internet in Germany.\u2019\u2019 Further, the association argues, because many people use Amazon as a modern card catalog to explore which books are available, if an author is not listed, a reader would assume that the writer has not published any books. \u2018\u2018Whoever is not listed on Amazon doesn\u2019t exist in the eyes of a reader,\u2019\u2019 the association said. In early May, authors published by Bonnier, one of Germany\u2019s largest media groups, noticed that Amazon was delaying shipments of their books, just as reports emerged that the online retailer was taking similar action against Hachette in the United States. Bonnier later confirmed that it was in negotiations with Amazon about how to share the earnings of its electronic books. Some titles from Bonnier publishers are still listed on Amazon as not being available to ship for as long as 11 days, instead of the next-day deliveries that are standard for all books ordered through any bookseller in Germany. The publishers contend that Amazon\u2019s action should be considered \u2018\u2018extortion,\u2019\u2019 and an abuse of the company\u2019s dominant position in the market. Adam Fletcher, a British author living in Berlin, said in an interview that he experienced first-hand the effects of being caught in the Amazon dispute. His newest book, \u2018\u2018Denglisch for Better Knowers,\u2019\u2019 which takes a tongue-in-cheek look at the quirkiness of the German language, was brought out in late May by Ullstein, a Bonnier imprint. Within weeks, however, he noticed that the book, which he co-wrote with Paul Hawkins, was failing to climb in the Amazon sales ranking despite an online marketing effort that included a quiz. At first unaware of the pricing dispute, he had asked his publisher why it was taking 6 to 11 days to ship his book. \u2018\u2018For a new book, the first few weeks are critical,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Fletcher said. Although Amazon on Monday started promising deliveries of \u2018\u2018Denglisch\u2019\u2019 by Friday, Mr. Fletcher said he was worried that shipping delays over the past few weeks might cost him crucial sales.",

        "name": "Delivery Drones Grounded by F.A.A. ",
        "content": " Delivery drones have barely taken off and they\u2019re already being grounded. In a memo released by the  Federal Aviation Administration   this week, the agency said that delivery drones used for business purposes will continue to be banned until further notice. Sorry Amazon, that includes you. Last year  on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Jeff Bezos , the Amazon founder, floated the notion of using drones to deliver packages. He showed Charlie Rose, the show\u2019s host, a tiny helicopter dropping Amazon packages on people\u2019s doorsteps. The company planned to name its new delivery service \u201cPrime Air.\u201d But the F.A.A. clearly wants people delivering packages the old fashioned way: by truck. In the F.A.A. memo, titled \u201cInterpretation of the Special Rule for Model Aircraft,\u201d the agency said that since 2007, the commercial use of drones has been illegal in the United States and would remain so until further notice. Until now, flying drones for fun is still considered legal, as long as they are kept below 400 feet and in no way used for commercial services. But what about Amazon\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d delivery. Couldn\u2019t the company just say these drones aren\u2019t being used for business? Not so fast, the F.A.A. said. \u201cAny operation not conducted strictly for hobby or recreation purposes could not be operated under the special rule for model aircraft. Clearly, commercial operations would not be hobby or recreation flights,\u201d the agency said in the memo. \u201cLikewise, flights that are in furtherance of a business, or incidental to a person\u2019s business, would not be a hobby or recreation flight.\u201d In my  column this week , \u201cSmile! A Drone Is About to Take Your Picture,\u201d I noted that drones are finally starting to enter the real world \u2014 and being used for selfies \u2014 but in the process, people are getting hurt by these autonomous flying vehicles. Ryan Calo, an assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Law who specializes in robotics and drones, told me that the worry about drones colliding in the air, or people being hit by them, will start to ease as drones become smarter. \u201cThe next generation of drones, which are truly autonomous and can navigate using sensors and code, rather than people controlling them, will be much safer than the drones we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Mr. Calo said in a phone interview. As Mr. Calo and others have pointed out, it is unlikely that drones will be permanently banned for commercial services in the United States. It\u2019s only a matter of time before these vehicles are safe enough and powerful enough to deliver packages. The F.A.A. said it plans to revisit commercial use of drones at a later date and potentially put new rules in place by 2015.",

        "name": "It\u2019s Time to Opt Out of Impulse Buying ",
        "content": " That was my first thought last week when Amazon officially introduced the Fire phone.  In an interview with The   Times\u2019s Farhad Manjoo , Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, made it very clear that one of the primary purposes of the device was to help you buy more stuff. When asked about the connection between the phone and buying from Amazon, Mr. Bezos replied, \u201cWe make those actions very simple. As we should. Guess what: One of the things people want to do with their phones is buy stuff, from Amazon and in general. So helping people take care of their shopping tasks is an important job to do in any smartphone.\u201d Let\u2019s get something straight. When Mr. Bezos says that people want help with their shopping tasks, he probably isn\u2019t talking about picking up some eggs and fruit for breakfast, even if Amazon is conducting  limited grocery tests . A better translation for his answer would be, \u201cWe want to help people spend more money on unnecessary plastic items in the hope that it will help us increase Amazon\u2019s profits.\u201d This blatant attempt to get American consumers to spend more is not new. But for some reason this one has me a bit upset. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything wrong with companies trying to sell more stuff. What bothers me is that we buy into the idea. The Times\u2019s David Streitfeld described the Fire phone   as offering \u201cAmazon fans the chance to live in an Amazon-themed world, where just about every element can be identified, listed, ranked, shared and, of course, ordered.\u201d Note he uses the word \u201cfans\u201d instead of \u201ccustomers.\u201d If we\u2019re fans, then we\u2019re just supporting something we love when we spend more money, right? Rebecca Lieb, an Altimeter Group analyst, said in the same article that you can use the phone to \u201cscan a product or listen to music, and you\u2019re delivered straight to the page on Amazon on which you can purchase it. Impulse shopping just went to a new level.\u201d Even Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of AT&T Mobility (the phone\u2019s exclusive carrier), raved that he planned to \u201cbuy a whole lot more \u2026 with this technology.\u201d But wait. I thought that after the Great Recession, we learned our lesson and were trying to buy less. Or, at the very least, aren\u2019t we trying to become clearer about why we\u2019re buying things? Don\u2019t we try to teach our children that one of the keys to a successful life is learning to control our impulses and to delay gratification? Haven\u2019t we   conclusively found   that buying more stuff does not make us happy? By dropping the Fire phone in our pocket, we\u2019re throwing all those lessons out the window. And that\u2019s on us, not Amazon. We\u2019re making the choice to pick up the phone, and we\u2019re signing on to the idea that we want it to be very easy to buy even more stuff. Almost all of the stuff I buy on my smartphone is a spontaneous purchase, not a carefully weighed decision. Do we really need more of those purchases in our lives? Yes, the Fire phone makes it that much easier to hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button, but is that a good thing? It\u2019s certainly not a path to greater happiness, even if it comes with free, two-day shipping. (Each phone includes a one-year Prime membership.) To be clear, the issue isn\u2019t whether companies like Amazon should find ways to profit from our behavior. The issue is whether we should be willing to go along with it, and even pay for the privilege of doing so, particularly when we look at other factors that we know affect our happiness. For instance, after ticking down steadily for several years during the recession, credit card debt resumed its upward trend in 2014. In April alone,  the balances on Americans\u2019 credit cards increased   \u201cat the fastest pace in almost 13 years.\u201d News items about this surge all praised \u201crising consumer confidence,\u201d but at the same time there are plenty of people nearing retirement who don\u2019t have enough money to stop working. The last time I checked, we weren\u2019t particularly happy when we\u2019re in greater debt and don\u2019t have enough money to retire. But that\u2019s the outcome we face when we don\u2019t bother to pull back and ask the bigger question about things like the Fire phone, including, \u201cDoes this device actually make my life better?\u201d and \u201cCould it make my life worse?\u201d Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t yet a device that makes it easy to say, \u201cI\u2019m better off NOT buying something.\u201d At the moment, all we have to rely on is who we see in the mirror, and maybe a better-behaved partner. So it\u2019s on us to push back against the things that encourage us to buy more instead of saving more. It\u2019s on us to opt out of things that make it so tempting to do things in the short term (credit card debt) that can cost us in the long term (retirement). We are more than a dollar sign to some company and it\u2019s time we started acting like it.

        "name": "Booksellers Score Some Points in Amazon's Spat With Hachette ",
        "content": " Robert Sindelar, the bearded, redheaded managing partner at the Seattle independent bookseller Third Place Books -- definitely a David to Amazon's Goliath -- got the idea to take on Amazon while attending BookExpo America in New York a few weeks ago. ''As you can imagine, all anyone was talking about was the standoff between Hachette and Amazon,'' he told me this week, referring to the much-publicized impasse in contentious negotiations between the publisher and the giant Internet bookseller. ''I wanted to do something positive that would take advantage of this.'' The New York Times revealed last month that Amazon seemed to be discouraging sales of Hachette books by failing to stock them, delaying delivery and removing pre-order buttons from its website. Exactly what the dispute involves has been shrouded in secrecy, but price is clearly at the center. Hachette and Amazon seem to be locked in the kind of intense negotiations that are common between manufacturers and retailers in most businesses, but have attracted enormous attention because of the visibility and cultural significance of books. (Negotiations between television program suppliers and cable companies have achieved similar notoriety and have also resulted in impasses.) I spoke to someone involved on the Hachette side of the negotiations, who is under orders not to discuss them and asked not to be named. This person said that Amazon has been demanding payments for a range of services, including the pre-order button, personalized recommendations and a dedicated employee at Amazon for Hachette books. This is similar to so-called co-op arrangements with traditional retailers, like paying Barnes & Noble for placing a book in the front of the store. Amazon ''is very inventive about what we'd call standard service,'' this person said. ''They're teasing out all these layers and saying, 'If you want that service, you'll have to pay for it.' In the end, it's very hard to know what you'd be paying. Hachette has refused, and so bit by bit, they've been taking away these services, like the pre-order button, to teach Hachette a lesson.'' What bothered Mr. Sindelar wasn't that Amazon's tactics were so hard-boiled. Rather, ''our goal as retailers is to connect people to books,'' he said. ''The notion that a retailer would obstruct readers from getting to certain books they want completely violates our ethics as retailers. I wondered how we could get that message across to customers.'' So Mr. Sindelar went to Hachette's publishing list, looking for the next potential blockbuster. At the Hachette subsidiary Little, Brown and Company, he found ''The Silkworm'' by Robert Galbraith -- a.k.a. J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series -- the follow-up to her best-seller ''The Cuckoo's Calling.'' ''That seemed obvious,'' he said. ''Ordinarily, we wouldn't get any pre-orders for a book like that. Zero. But Amazon had deleted its pre-order button, so I thought we could capitalize on that.'' Third Place Books began featuring ''The Silkworm'' prominently on the home page of its website, offering hardcover copies at a 20 percent discount along with free, in-person delivery the day the book was released, which was Thursday. Mr. Sindelar, along with several other store employees, delivered the books (although a surprising number of customers said not to bother -- they wanted to come into the store for their copy). He also handed out what he called ''Hachette swag bags'' with a T-shirt and advance copy of a coming Hachette novel. Some buyers also received a surprise visit from a local author, Maria Semple, who wrote the best-selling book ''Where'd You Go, Bernadette.'' ''I thought this would show what we as booksellers stand for,'' Mr. Sindelar said. ''While Amazon is blocking people, we literally put the book in their hands. But we're not asking people to boycott Amazon. We're in Seattle and Amazon is a big part of the local economy. We're sensitive to that.'' So Third Place Books didn't participate in the campaign to place ''I didn't buy it on Amazon'' stickers on books that the comedian Stephen Colbert started this month on his show on Comedy Central. (Hachette is Mr. Colbert's publisher, and the sticker campaign is backed by the American Booksellers Association.) ''We decided not to get down in the mud with everybody else,'' Mr. Sindelar said. ''I'm tired of defining ourselves in terms of being different from Amazon. I thought this was a healthy, positive way to show how we operate and what we value.'' Mr. Sindelar's efforts to gain at the expense of a major rival like Amazon could also be described in another healthy, positive way: competition. Amazon's decision to take a hard line with Hachette seems to have provided a sudden competitive advantage for other booksellers, large and small. On Walmart.com on Thursday, ''The Silkworm'' was one of three books featured on the books' home page at 40 percent off, or $16.80. Walmart has also promoted the book with ads on Facebook and through mass emails to its customers promoting Hachette books. On Barnes & Noble's site, ''The Silkworm'' was one of four of ''the week's biggest books.'' A digital edition for the Nook was $11.99. It was Barnes & Noble's No. 2 best-seller on Thursday. On Bookish, the website that the major publishers started last year to combat Amazon, it was the first ''new and notable'' release featured, and was selling for $19.60. Amazon showed no sign of backing down. On Thursday, it was selling ''The Silkworm'' in hardback for $25.20 -- nearly the full suggested retail price -- along with the message that delivery could take ''2 to 4 weeks.'' On Thursday afternoon, the book's best-seller rank was just 210. (The Kindle digital edition was $9.99.) From Mr. Sindelar's perspective, his promotion was successful. He said he sold 60 copies on the first day, when ordinarily, he said, he'd be lucky to sell five. All of this must be warming the hearts of antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which was widely criticized after it filed an antitrust case against five major publishers and Apple, accusing them of conspiring to raise e-book prices. The five publishers -- Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon & Schuster (all the so-called majors except Random House) -- settled the charges with the department and agreed not to collude. Apple was found guilty after a lengthy trial. (It is appealing the decision.) A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the Amazon-Hachette dispute. To many, especially publishers, authors and booksellers, it seemed perverse that the government sued the major publishers and Apple, whose iBookstore was a new entrant into digital publishing, and not Amazon itself, which seemed to be rapidly amassing quasi-monopoly power in book retailing. But as Judge Denise Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled, the evidence was overwhelming that the publishers' and Apple's goal wasn't to promote competition, but to raise e-book prices so that Apple wouldn't lose money and so that e-book sales wouldn't undercut the far more profitable sales of hardcover books. She noted that monopoly power isn't illegal unless it's gained unlawfully, in which case the publishers and Apple should have filed a complaint with the government rather than conspiring to raise prices. ''Another company's alleged violation of antitrust laws is not an excuse for engaging in your own violations of law,'' she ruled. ''Antitrust laws were enacted for the 'protection of competition, not competitors,' '' she continued, quoting a famous Supreme Court case. Still, even Amazon seems willing to make some concessions. Two Hachette books, J. D. Salinger's ''The Catcher in the Rye'' and ''The Goldfinch,'' by Donna Tartt, are available on Amazon at deep discounts and for immediate delivery. Why that would be the case isn't clear, but one is a classic used in many schools and the other recently won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. The next big test for Hachette and Amazon will probably come next week, when the Hachette subsidiary Little, Brown will publish ''Invisible'' by the mega-best-selling author James Patterson and the novelist David Ellis. The book isn't available for pre-order on Amazon, although a free 28-page preview is available to Kindle readers. Amazon confirmed on its website that it was not taking pre-orders for Hachette books. In its statement, it said that it was ''the right of a retailer to determine whether the terms on offer are acceptable and to stock items accordingly.'' Hachette declined to comment on negotiations with Amazon. As for ''The Silkworm,'' a spokeswoman for Little, Brown said it was too soon to have any sales numbers, but ''the early feedback we've had from retailers is very encouraging.'' And while Hachette is the lone publisher operating in the United States in the current standoff, other contracts between Amazon and major publishers will soon be expiring. The other publishers and booksellers are eager to see if they, too, hold the line. (There's nothing illegal about publishers adopting similar stances in their negotiations, as long as they don't collude.) Whether even the combined efforts of the publishers and competitive efforts of rival retailers can dent Amazon's market power remains to be seen. Amazon accounts for about a third of book sales in the United States and 60 percent of Hachette's digital sales. The person involved in the Hachette negotiations wasn't optimistic for the publishers. In previous rounds with Amazon, ''We had so little leverage. It felt like I had a slingshot and they had a tank. We'd fight and fight and then we'd make concessions. They rolled over us.'' This person compared Hachette's situation to that of gazelles, a reference to Brad Stone's book about Amazon, ''The Everything Store.'' In it, Mr. Stone describes what was known inside the company as ''The Gazelle Project,'' in which the chief executive, Jeffrey Bezos, compared Amazon to a cheetah hunting weak, sickly gazelles -- in that case, a metaphor for small publishers. ''Who's going to blink first?'' mused Mr. Sindelar, the independent bookseller. ''That's what everyone wants to know. I have no idea. But a lot of our customers told us they were buying from us explicitly as a protest against Amazon. We live in Seattle, where people go to farmers' markets. They don't want to limit the diversity of where they shop. I think this has helped people realize that if Amazon is the only option, that's putting way too much power in one company.''

        "content": " Robert Sindelar, the bearded, redheaded managing partner at the Seattle independent bookseller Third Place Books \u2014 definitely a David to Amazon\u2019s Goliath \u2014 got the idea to take on Amazon while attending BookExpo America in New York a few weeks ago. \u2018\u2018As you can imagine, all anyone was talking about was the standoff between Hachette and Amazon,\u2019\u2019 he told me in the past week, referring to the much-publicized impasse in contentious negotiations between the publisher and the giant Internet bookseller. \u2018\u2018I wanted to do something positive that would take advantage of this.\u2019\u2019 The New York Times revealed last month that Amazon seemed to be discouraging sales of Hachette books by failing to stock them, delaying delivery and removing preorder buttons from its website. Exactly what the dispute involves has been shrouded in secrecy, but price is clearly at the center. Hachette and Amazon seem to be locked in the kind of intense negotiations that are common between manufacturers and retailers in most businesses, but have attracted enormous attention because of the visibility and cultural significance of books. I spoke to someone involved on the Hachette side of the negotiations who is under orders not to discuss them and asked not to be named. This person said that Amazon had been demanding payments for a range of services, including the preorder button, personalized recommendations and a dedicated employee at Amazon for Hachette books. This is similar to so-called co-op arrangements with traditional retailers, like paying Barnes & Noble for placing a book in the front of the store. Amazon \u2018\u2018is very inventive about what we\u2019d call standard service,\u2019\u2019 this person said. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re teasing out all these layers and saying, \u2018If you want that service, you\u2019ll have to pay for it.\u2019 In the end, it\u2019s very hard to know what you\u2019d be paying. Hachette has refused, and so bit by bit, they\u2019ve been taking away these services, like the preorder button, to teach Hachette a lesson.\u2019\u2019 What bothered Mr. Sindelar wasn\u2019t that Amazon\u2019s tactics were so hard-boiled.

(Hachette is Mr. Colbert\u2019s publisher, and the sticker campaign is backed by the American Booksellers Association.) \u2018\u2018We decided not to get down in the mud with everybody else,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Sindelar said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m tired of defining ourselves in terms of being different from Amazon.

        "content": " People outside the United States hoping to get their hands on Amazon\u2019s new smartphone will have to wait awhile. During the much-anticipated announcement of the company\u2019s Fire handset, little attention was given to Amazon\u2019s international operations, which deliver about 40 percent of its annual sales. Amazon is in talks with several European mobile carriers, including Vodafone of Britain and Telef\u00f3nica of Spain, though no deal has been finalized to bring the phone to Europe, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Representatives of Vodafone and Telef\u00f3nica declined to comment, while a representative for Amazon was not immediately available to comment. For now, the smartphone is only available in the United States, and exclusively from AT&T. When Amazon eventually takes its new phone abroad, it is likely to face an uphill battle to lure Europeans away from their devices in favor of an untested competitor intended to link users to Amazon\u2019s e-commerce empire. Online retail spending in Europe remains less developed than in America. And despite efforts by other technology giants like Microsoft to break into the smartphone market, Europeans still favor devices made by the market leaders, Apple and Samsung. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s already a pretty crowded market,\u2019\u2019 said Neil Mawston, an analyst with the technology researchers Strategy Analytics. \u2018\u2018Amazon will have to pull out all the stops to make an impression.\u2019\u2019 Amazon rolled out a number of new features in the hopes of winning market share from Apple and Samsung. One of them, a product recognition feature, allows users to scan images of items like books, DVDs and food using the smartphone\u2019s camera and buy the products on Amazon\u2019s website. While the phone\u2019s e-commerce feature may prove enticing to Americans accustomed to buying goods online, the service may be less successful in Europe, which has lagged in e-commerce. Online retail spending in eight of Europe\u2019s largest economies, including those of France, Germany and Britain, is expected to total about $189 billion this year, compared with $306 billion in the United States, according to the Center for Retail Research, a British consulting group. The United States, whose population is about the same as the combined population of the eight European countries surveyed, has a higher percentage of shoppers online and those shoppers each spend several hundred dollars more a year than do online consumers in Europe, the research group said. Countries like Germany and Britain are among Amazon\u2019s largest markets outside of the United States. Analysts say Amazon might be able to attract customers in Germany and Britain to its smartphone by allowing them to linking the device with other offerings like its fast-shipping services, which have proved successful in those markets. As part of its American rollout, Amazon will offer a free one-year membership to its Amazon Prime service, which includes free shipping and online video streaming. The Fire phone sells for $199 with a two-year AT&T contract. \u2018\u2018Amazon will have to convince its Prime users in Europe to use its smartphone,\u2019\u2019 said Roberta Cozza of the technology research company Gartner. But for the Fire phone to take hold beyond these European countries, Amazon will have to get consumers in other parts of the region to not only buy the device but also to spend more money online. \u2018\u2018We are further behind the U.S. in embracing e-commerce,\u2019\u2019 said Joshua Bamfield, director of the Center for Retail Research. Amazon\u2019s phone \u2018\u2018is unlikely to be as popular here as it could be in the U.S.,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

        "name": "A phone to pull buyers into the world of Amazon ",
        "content": " Amazon has announced a device that tries to fulfill the retailer\u2019s dream of being integrated into consumers\u2019 lives at every possible waking moment \u2014 whether they are deciding where to eat, realizing they need more toilet paper or intrigued by a snatch of overheard music. The device is a cellphone, but making calls on it got almost no attention at all at the event in Seattle where it was introduced on Wednesday. The Fire phone, the product of four years of research and development, offers Amazon fans the chance to live in an Amazon-themed world, where just about every element can be identified, listed, ranked, shared and, of course, ordered. It offered a view of a mobile future that will be alluring to some but might repel others. If the device works as described, and Amazon entices even a small portion of its 250 million active customers to buy one, the Fire could accelerate Amazon\u2019s already intense competition with other retailers and tech companies, not to mention intensifying some of its current battles with suppliers. As if to underline the no-gloves nature of the battle, a promotional video in the first few moments of the presentation took a direct slap at Apple. The Fire\u2019s product recognition feature, Firefly, \u2018\u2018is potentially a real threat to bricks and mortar retailers,\u2019\u2019 said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. \u2018\u2018Scan a product or listen to music, and you\u2019re delivered straight to the page on Amazon on which you can purchase it. Impulse shopping just went to a new level.\u2019\u2019 Amazon\u2019s phone \u2014 consumers in the United States can order it now; it ships starting July 25 \u2014 is arriving as the leading technology companies are increasingly trying to develop an array of services and products to keep consumers from wandering, the digital equivalent of Disney\u2019s not wanting you to leave Disneyland for lunch. Microsoft brought out a tablet; Facebook tried a phone; Google is experimenting with a shopping and delivery service. Against such a frenzy of competition and innovation, an Amazon phone was inevitable. The company\u2019s leaders asked themselves only one question, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, told the crowd at the event: \u2018\u2018Can we build a better phone for our most engaged customers?\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos promoted Firefly heavily, as well as something Amazon calls Dynamic Perspective. Cameras on the phone allow the user to gain another view of a video game or see layered information on a map, like a Yelp review. Whether Dynamic Perspective is a gimmick or something more will depend on how aggressively developers invent new apps for it. \u2018\u2018This is the next big battleground in the ecosystem war,\u2019\u2019 said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie. \u2018\u2018Amazon is not going to turn the tide decisively in its favor with this, but just needs to establish a beachhead.\u2019\u2019 Amazon\u2019s leap into the smartphone business comes as sales of the devices are beginning to mature, at least in the United States and Europe. Their use for shopping, however, is just beginning to explode. In the United States, purchases made with phones will jump more than 25 percent this year, to over $18 billion, according to eMarketer. Mr. Bezos, for all his zeal, was relatively circumspect about the phone\u2019s ultimate implications. Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of AT&T Mobility, Amazon\u2019s carrier partner, was more direct during a brief appearance on stage. \u2018\u2018I am going to buy a whole lot more things with this technology than I ever have before,\u2019\u2019 Mr. de la Vega said. One interesting question will be whether the phone will allow apps that might take customers to retailers whose prices undercut Amazon. Will residents of Planet Amazon, in other words, be permitted to visit other shopping worlds? \u2018\u2018Our idea is to give the lowest price to the customer,\u2019\u2019 Dave Limp, an Amazon executive, said in an interview. \u2018\u2018If we don\u2019t have it, shame on us.\u2019\u2019 The lengthy development process for the Amazon phone was partly a result of the difficulty of the task. Phones are a graveyard of tech dreams. Just ask Google, which was hailed as a genius for buying the handset maker Motorola, and then hailed again for cutting its losses and promptly selling the faded icon. Only Apple and Samsung have found making phones consistently profitable. But Amazon, as always, is operating with a different playbook. When Amazon introduced the Kindle Fire in 2011, there was a lot of chatter about its being a challenge to Apple\u2019s iPad. It was not. In the first quarter of this year, Apple had about a third of the tablet market, according to the research firm the International Data Corporation. Amazon had less than 2 percent. Still, that is a million more consumers taking up residence in the Amazon ecosystem. Just about anyone who has a Kindle Fire is a candidate for membership in Amazon\u2019s fast-shipping club, Amazon Prime, and just about any Prime member might be enticed to buy a Kindle. Amazon Prime has an estimated 20 million subscribers, at $99 a year. The Fire Phone costs $199 with a two-year contract with AT&T. But Amazon, as expected, is adding a year of free Prime club membership. \u2018\u2018If they are able to capture 10 percent of those Prime subscribers in the near term, then that would likely constitute a success,\u2019\u2019 said Eugene Signorini, vice president for mobile insights at Mobiquity. That would force Google and Apple, and possibly Facebook and Microsoft, to introduce innovations and new features in their own products. Mr. Schachter of Macquarie said that would benefit consumers in the short term. And in the long term, if Amazon or one of the other companies becomes dominant to the exclusion of all others? \u2018\u2018That might be more problematic,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Schachter said.",

        "content": " Shortly after he introduced the new Fire phone on Wednesday, I spoke with Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, about the device and Amazon's goals in the smartphone business. Here is an edited transcript of the conversation. Sadly, it does not do justice to Mr. Bezos's booming laugh, which punctuated many of his sentences. Q. Why did you make a phone? A. Our product development process always starts the same way. We don't start out by saying, ''We have to build an X.'' We say, ''If we were going to build an X, how would it be different? How would it be better?'' And it can't just be different. It has to be different constrained by customers caring. It's easy to be different if you don't constrain it that way. But it has to be useful. Q. But are you too late into this market? A. I think in the whole evolution of this, we're still pretty early. I don't want to judge before all the facts are in, but I think this wireless thing is going to be big. If we go back in time just five, six, seven years, we're talking about different players -- Nokia, BlackBerry and others. Things change very rapidly in this area. Q. I was surprised that you weren't competing on price so aggressively. This is essentially the same price as rival devices. A. Well, it's 32 gigabytes instead of 16, which is a big deal. So don't forget that small fact! And it has Prime -- for new or existing members, you get 12 months free. But it's a really premium phone. We've packed a lot of hardware, a lot of expensive materials into the phone. Q. Are you saying you're not making a profit on the phone? When you launched the Kindle tablets, you said you didn't want to make money when people buy your devices -- you want to make money when people use your devices. A. I'm saying we haven't changed our approach. We look at it holistically. I still see people using second-generation Kindles, like if I go to the beach. Gosh, that's a six-year-old Kindle. And we don't have to feel bad about that. We don't have to wish they were on the upgrade treadmill. I like the alignment with the customer. With the $199 phone -- that's the same approach. Q. The other thing that's clear about the device is that it hooks you into buying from Amazon very directly. A. We make those actions very simple. As we should. Guess what: One of the things people want to do with their phones is buy stuff, from Amazon and in general. So helping people take care of their shopping tasks is an important job to do in any smartphone. But that's not what the phone is about. It has to stand on its own as a fantastic phone. It even has to make phone calls. And most exciting for us is third-party developers. It's easy to add custom actions to Firefly [the Fire's image-recognition system], and it's going to be really interesting to see what they come up with. Q. It sounds like you've been using the Fire phone as your own phone. What were you using before, and what's it been like to use this? A. Well, Samsung. And the thing I've noticed is when I switch back to another phone, I'm still reaching for the gestures that work so reliably on Fire phone, like autoscroll. For the design team, invention is about stepping back and finding those things in technology that aren't ideal, but you're so inured to them that you don't realize they could probably be improved. Traditionally scrolling is not that good. It's often a two-handed gesture. You're interjecting your finger in front of the screen. Once you get used to autoscrolling, you'll be trying to do it on another device -- and that's a good sign. Q. How will you know whether this phone is working? What are your benchmarks? A. We have a long history of getting started and being patient. There are lot of assets you have to bring to bear to be able to offer a phone like this. The huge content ecosystem is one of them. The reputation for customer support is one of them. We have a lot of those pieces in place. It's our job to keep inventing and to be patient. One thing leads to the next. Q. Is it too simplistic to point to one number -- to say the phone is aimed at selling Prime memberships, say? A. Yes, that is too simplistic. If you looked at the ratio of hard work in this to selling Prime memberships, that would be the hardest thing we could do. If you just looked at the number of machine vision and computer scientists, hardware engineers, you're talking about thousands of people building this phone. Now, all of these things are self-reinforcing. The phone will make Prime memberships better, and Prime looks great on this phone. It's not that there's no interaction between these elements. But to say that's the primary purpose is too simplistic. Q. You showed a graph of Prime memberships rising sharply. Is that because of your media content? A. I think so. It's always hard to know for sure. But when we started Prime Instant Video, we started with 5,000 videos. People loved it. They didn't say, ''It's terrible, it's just 5,000 videos.'' They said, ''I bought this for fast, unlimited shipping, and I just got this really cool thing at no additional charge.'' And now it's 40,000 videos, including much-sought-after exclusives. We can track people who are joining Prime for the first time, and we know if they're coming from a page about free shipping or a page about Prime Instant Video. With every passing year, that is shifting toward Prime Instant Videos. There's one group of customers who start their membership because of Prime Instant Video, but they're like, ''I got this free two-day shipping thing.'' There's this other group that starts with free shipping. That's still the bigger group, and they're like, ''I can get this cool video.'' All these things work together. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

        "content": " When Amazon invited the media and hundreds of its most loyal customers to witness the unveiling of a new device on Wednesday, everyone thought the company would introduce a smartphone made in the mold of its line of tablet computers: pretty good and really cheap. Everyone was wrong. Though the device is called the Fire phone, Amazon\u2019s new gadget is less a phone than a pocketable cash register hooked directly into the retailer\u2019s intelligent warehouses. And it\u2019s not cheap. The Fire phone sells for $199 with a two-year AT&T contract. Although it also comes with a free one-year subscription to Amazon\u2019s Prime membership, the Fire phone is essentially the same price as high-end phones made by Apple and Samsung. For Amazon, a company whose previous devices have had innovative pricing plans that often involved selling devices at cost, the Fire phone\u2019s uninspired price tag is a surprising disappointment. The world needed a great, cheap smartphone. With its huge reach, obsessive dedication to customer service and a willingness to forgo immediate profits, Amazon seems uniquely capable of delivering such a device. But instead of a cheap phone, Amazon delivered a device packed with many high-end, whiz-bang features. Some of those features may be attractive to people who already love Amazon, but for people who aren\u2019t looking to be hooked so intimately into Amazon\u2019s brain, it\u2019s hard to see what this phone offers over the iPhone, the Samsung Galaxy or any other top-of-the-line smartphone on the market today. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a really premium phone,\u2019\u2019 said Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, when asked during an interview about the phone\u2019s price. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve packed a lot of hardware and expensive material in.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos declined to say whether the company would make a profit on each phone sold. In the past, the company has eschewed that model of hardware sales. But he said the Fire phone\u2019s technological capabilities made it a bargain at its price. It\u2019s true that the Fire phone has several novel features. Among them is an image-recognition system, Firefly, that will let you identify any book, movie, phone number or other object you point at your phone. Firefly is the heart of the phone\u2019s connection to Amazon\u2019s shopping engine. Aim the device at anything around your house, like a bag of cat litter or a tube of toothpaste, and the phone instantly recognizes it and gives you an option to buy the item and have it delivered immediately. During a short demonstration of the phone, which is available for order now and will ship on July 25, I found that feature to be eerily accurate. It flawlessly recognized pretty much everything I pointed to, offering me a way to buy something on the fly \u2014 from Amazon. Mr. Bezos pushed back against the idea that there was anything nefarious about this connection to Amazon\u2019s store. \u2018\u2018Helping people take care of their shopping tasks is an important job to do in any smartphone,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018But that\u2019s not what the phone is all about.\u2019\u2019 He added that it would be \u2018\u2018too simplistic\u2019\u2019 to call the phone simply a vehicle for selling Prime memberships, though he conceded that Prime members would get a lot out of this device. The Fire has an innovative 3-D display that adds a sense of perspective to some of its user-interface screens. The system also allows you to scroll or browse through content by tilting the phone in certain ways. That feature leans more toward the gimmicky than the useful, but not in an annoying way. It does not slow down or otherwise interrupt how you use the device, but I\u2019m not sure that it will add much, either. On the other hand, it does look pretty cool. Amazon has included two features that are unusual and useful. One is Mayday, Amazon\u2019s live video customer service, which it began offering on its Kindle Fire tablets last year. The feature lets you call up an instant, on-screen video chat with a customer service representative at the push of a button. Even the best, easiest-to-use smartphones can sometimes be vexing. How do you connect your phone to both your work and personal calendar? How do you get on your company\u2019s VPN? What\u2019s the best way to send your mother a dozen full-resolution photos? Answering such questions for other phones involves consulting confusing online instructions, calling an 800 number or driving to a store. With Mayday, you just beckon for help; it\u2019s immediate and delightful. The other fantastic Fire phone feature: Every photo you snap on the phone is backed up on Amazon\u2019s servers free. There\u2019s no limit to how many photos are stored there. It\u2019s a simple, headache-free backup system that I wish every other phone manufacturer offered \u2014 Apple most urgently. And yet, despite these distinctions, Amazon\u2019s phone suffers severe shortcomings compared with similarly priced rivals. Its app store doesn\u2019t have anywhere near the number of third-party programs currently available on the iPhone or Android devices. There are more than 200,000 apps in Amazon\u2019s store, but almost all are designed for the firm\u2019s tablets. IOS and Android have app stores approaching a million titles. Because Amazon\u2019s phone is based on a version of Google\u2019s Android operating system, it could be pretty simple for developers to transform some of their Android phone apps into Amazon phone apps, but it\u2019s impossible to predict how many will do that. With a cheaper phone marketed at a broader audience, Amazon could have jump-started that process. But a phone whose primary audience consists of Amazon Prime members may not be that attractive to developers. More challenging than the app shortage is the phone\u2019s novel user interface. While the Fire phone does look simple, it\u2019s thoroughly new. People who are used to iOS and Android will need to figure out new ways to get around this device. It didn\u2019t have to be this way. Amazon\u2019s phone is making its debut at a pivotal time in the business \u2014 when innovation in high-end smartphones seems to have plateaued, with each new top phone just incrementally better than the last. If expensive phones are now considered boring, customers might well begin to wonder if they need to spend all that much. Amazon could have offered a groundbreaking alternative \u2014 a great phone without whiz-bang features, for a substantial discount. How much cheaper? Consider this math. Amazon\u2019s $200-with-contract price implies a full sales price of about $650. You don\u2019t see that price when you sign up for service, but it will be built into your monthly bill. For instance, if you get a 1 GB plan from AT&T with the new phone, you will pay $82 a month \u2014 $50 a month for data service, plus an additional $32 a month for the Fire phone. The iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy sell for the same price. If Amazon hadn\u2019t added many of the more far-out features in the phone, it might have been able to make the phone for $250. If it sold its device at that price, then, your monthly bill would be $62.50 instead \u2014 $50 for data, plus only $12.50 for the phone. That might have been truly groundbreaking. Although he did not show the feature onstage, Mr. Bezos confirmed that his expensive new phone does makes calls. \u2018\u2018I haven\u2019t made a phone call on my phone in a long time,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018But I know people still make phone calls.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " Like any mystery novel expected to be a summer blockbuster, Robert Galbraith's ''The Silkworm,'' set for release on Thursday, features shadowy subtext and crafty machinations -- but in this book's case the maneuverings are both on and off the page. That's because Mr. Galbraith is not a run-of-the-mill thriller writer but the pseudonym for J. K. Rowling, creator of the Harry Potter series, and the publisher is Little, Brown and Company, a division of Hachette Book Group, which is locked in battle with Amazon, the giant online retailer. Amazon, which controls roughly a third of the United States book market, has been discouraging sales of Hachette books in an effort to make the publisher agree to terms on a new contract for its e-books. As part of the standoff, Amazon has removed pre-order buttons for several Hachette titles, including ''The Silkworm.'' While Amazon's hardball tactics have been a nightmare for Hachette and its affected authors, other booksellers have smelled opportunity. With ''The Silkworm'' expected to be a big hit -- the first Galbraith book, ''The Cuckoo's Calling,'' was a No. 1 New York Times bestseller -- retailers from independent bookstores to giant box chains are looking to exploit the dispute to win back customers who may be frustrated by Amazon's lack of inventory. (An Amazon spokeswoman said it will begin selling ''The Silkworm'' on Thursday, though it is unclear whether it will have it in stock or there will be shipping delays, as there have been with other Hachette books.) Walmart, especially, is looking to capitalize. In the last few weeks, the retailer has augmented its promotional strategy to give ''The Silkworm'' an additional boost. This week, Walmart-sponsored advertisements started appearing on Facebook, promoting heavily discounted books -- most visibly ''The Silkworm'' -- at Walmart. And a few weeks ago, the company sent an email to millions of customers promoting certain Hachette titles. It also displayed those books on its home page, and ''The Silkworm'' was featured. ''We just want to continue to let customers and readers know that they can find 'Silkworm' and other Hachette titles at Walmart,'' said Jaeme Laczkowski, a Walmart spokeswoman. On the other end of the bookselling spectrum, Third Place Books in Seattle has been giving 20 percent off the $28 list price to customers who pre-order the book from them and has promised to hand-deliver on Thursday. Other major booksellers are also eagerly awaiting the arrival of ''The Silkworm.'' At Books-A-Million, for example, some Hachette titles are available for up to 40 percent off, and ''The Silkworm'' will be featured prominently at the front of the store for a discount of up to 30 percent. This week, the home page of the iTunes book section has featured a list of e-books available for pre-order for an unusually low price of $9.99 or less, all of which are Hachette titles, including ''The Silkworm.'' Hudson Booksellers, the ubiquitous airport bookstore, has created a Hachette page on its website that includes titles for 30 and 40 percent off -- along with a red downloadable sticker that reads ''I Didn't Buy it on Amazon.'' That sticker was first shown on Stephen Colbert's show earlier this month, and is also available for download on his website. (Mr. Colbert is a Hachette author.) Barnes & Noble has not adjusted its marketing plan for ''The Silkworm'' over the last few weeks -- its executives said they had always planned to give it a full-throated promotional push. Its efforts appear to be paying off. On Thursday, the book was ranked No. 1 among hardcover titles on the company's website. ''We've partnered with Hachette and supported J. K. Rowling from the very beginning,'' Mary Amicucci, vice president of adult trade books at Barnes & Noble, said in an email. ''We know 'Silkworm' is going to be one of our biggest books of the summer and have put forth our full marketing assets.'''' Similarly, Little, Brown, the publisher of ''The Silkworm,'' had ambitious marketing plans in place before the fight with Amazon broke out. Heather Fain, a marketing executive at Little, Brown, noted that while the inability to pre-order from Amazon could have hurt the book's sales, it also received a big publicity boost from all the attention it has received because of the dispute. J. K. Rowling's new book ''The Silkworm,'' to be released on Thursday, is expected to be a top seller. Walmart and other booksellers are racing to promote it, even at a discount.

        "content": " In all the hoo-ha around Amazon\u2019s entry into the smartphone market Wednesday with its  Fire   phone, complete with 3D screen and the ability to drive users to the Amazon marketplace, one pretty important issue has been overlooked: Will it work as a fashion accessory? And no, I am not being sarcastic. After all, there\u2019s no doubt that a meaningful driver of the iPhone\u2019s success (and, indeed, the success of the iEverything) has been design \u2014 the fact that consumers see it not just as a cool, functional piece of technology but as a luxury item that reflects something about their own values and makes them look good. Apple reached not just the \u201cgadgetheads,\u201d but the style obsessives as well. One of Steve Jobs\u2019s great insights was that technology could take a page from high-fashion strategy in terms of tapping into desire and utilizing seasonal planned obsolescence in order to sell more stuff. Lots more stuff. No other smartphone maker has been able to push those buttons as effectively, and get consumers to identify with their products the way, say, they identify with their handbags. So what are Amazon\u2019s chances? I\u2019d say so-so. From what I can see, the phone looks good. I quite like the all-black casing and screen (black being very fashion), which makes the visuals pop. The problem is Amazon\u2019s own image as the superstore for everything, not an exclusive, discriminating emporium. Its draw for consumers (for yours truly, if I am being honest) has always been ease and access: You can find anything if you are willing to weed through page after page of options. Yippee! But it just doesn\u2019t make its choices feel special. And the promise of feeling special is what draws consumers to fashion. This is why Amazon \u2014 despite lots of talk about opportunity in high-end fashion and the fact that Jeff Bezos actually stood next to fashion\u2019s grand pooh-bah Anna Wintour in black tie as  a sponsor of the Met Ball   in 2012 \u2014 has always been viewed with skepticism by members of the premium fashion industry.  They are not convinced   it is the \u201cright environment\u201d for their products. And by \u201cright environment,\u201d read \u201cin-crowd enough.\u201d It ain\u2019t pretty, but it\u2019s true. All of which is to say that I can see people buying the phone for its bells and whistles but I\u2019m not convinced that it has that ephemeral je ne sais quoi that will drive them to buy the next iteration, and the next, just to keep up with the latest styles (in phones, natch). I mean, I love my Kindle, but there\u2019s nothing about how it looks that has ever convinced me I need to upgrade just because I want a thinner/sleeker/grayer product.",

And the thing I\u2019ve noticed is when I switch back to another phone, I\u2019m still reaching for the gestures that work so reliably on Fire phone, like autoscroll. For the design team, invention is about stepping back and finding those things in technology that aren\u2019t ideal, but you\u2019re so inured to them that you don\u2019t realize they could probably be improved. Traditionally scrolling is not that good. It\u2019s often a two-handed gesture. You\u2019re interjecting your finger in front of the screen. Once you get used to autoscrolling, you\u2019ll be trying to do it on another device \u2014 and that\u2019s a good sign. Q. How will you know whether this phone is working? What are your benchmarks? A. We have a long history of getting started and being patient. There are lot of assets you have to bring to bear to be able to offer a phone like this. The huge content ecosystem is one of them. The reputation for customer support is one of them. We have a lot of those pieces in place. It\u2019s our job to keep inventing and to be patient. One thing leads to the next. Q. Is it too simplistic to point to one number \u2014 to say the phone is aimed at selling Prime memberships, say? A. Yes, that is too simplistic.

It\u2019s not that there\u2019s no interaction between these elements. But to say that\u2019s the primary purpose is too simplistic. Q. You showed a graph of Prime memberships rising sharply. Is that because of your media content? A. I think so. It\u2019s always hard to know for sure. But when we started Prime Instant Video, we started with 5,000 videos. People loved it. They didn\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s just 5,000 videos.\u201d They said, \u201cI bought this for fast, unlimited shipping, and I just got this really cool thing at no additional charge.\u201d And now it\u2019s 40,000 videos, including much-sought-after exclusives. We can track people who are joining Prime for the first time, and we know if they\u2019re coming from a page about free shipping or a page about Prime Instant Video. With every passing year, that is shifting toward Prime Instant Videos. There\u2019s one group of customers who start their membership because of Prime Instant Video, but they\u2019re like, \u201cI got this free two-day shipping thing.\u201d There\u2019s this other group that starts with free shipping. That\u2019s still the bigger group, and they\u2019re like, \u201cI can get this cool video.\u201d All these things work together.",

        "content": " When Amazon invited the media and hundreds of its most loyal customers to Seattle to witness  the unveiling of a   new device on Wednesday , everyone thought the company would introduce a smartphone made in the mold of its line of tablet computers: pretty good and really cheap. Everyone was wrong,  Farhad Manjoo argues in his State of the Art column . Though the device is called the Fire phone, Amazon\u2019s new gadget is less a phone than a pocketable cash register hooked directly into the retailer\u2019s intelligent warehouses. And it\u2019s not cheap. The Fire phone sells for $199 with a two-year AT&T contract. Although it also comes with a free one-year subscription to Amazon\u2019s Prime membership, the Fire phone is essentially the same price as high-end phones made by Apple and Samsung. For Amazon, a company whose previous devices have had innovative pricing plans that often involved selling devices at cost, the Fire phone\u2019s uninspired price tag is a surprising disappointment. The world needed a great, cheap smartphone. With its huge reach, obsessive dedication to customer service, and a willingness to forgo immediate profits, Amazon seems uniquely capable of delivering such a device. But instead of a cheap phone, Amazon delivered a device packed with many high-end, whiz-bang features. Some of those features may be attractive to people who already love Amazon, but for people who aren\u2019t looking to be hooked so intimately into Amazon\u2019s brain, it\u2019s hard to see what this phone offers over the iPhone, the Samsung Galaxy or any other top-of-the-line smartphone on the market today.",

        "content": " Amazon\u2019s new Fire phone might be less about the phone and more about what its computing power can do in a few years, when it is built into futuristic devices like Internet-connected contact lenses, as  I wrote today on the   Upshot . But in the meantime, Amazon still needs to sell some phones. The challenge is that by now, mostly people have already chosen their smartphones, and have doubled down in Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s world as a result. For many, the  complication and cost of switching   to an Amazon phone is too much, and the benefits too small. Still, data shows that Amazon Prime and mobile shoppers are each so valuable to Amazon that it might not need that many people to buy a Fire to make it worthwhile \u2014 as long as it gets its most loyal customers to switch. Amazon doesn\u2019t say how many Prime members it has, but analysts think it\u2019s somewhere around 25 million. They shop on Amazon more often, and spend significantly more money than other Amazon shoppers \u2013 an average $58 per transaction, versus $41 for non-Prime members, according to comScore. Prime shoppers account for half of Amazon\u2019s sales, comScore estimates. Amazon\u2019s ultimate goal, of course, is to sell stuff: books and clothes and diapers and movies and songs. And people are increasingly shopping on their phones. Consumers spent $7.3 billion on mobile devices in the first quarter of the year, which is just 11.5 percent of the amount they spent on e-commerce as a whole. But mobile spending is growing at double the rate of shopping on computers. In the last year, the number of people who shop on Amazon only on their phones has grown 32 percent, comScore said. And perhaps most important for retailers and advertisers, 78 percent of shopping searches on mobile phones result in a purchase \u2013 significantly more than on desktop computers or tablets. The Amazon phone\u2019s Firefly feature recognizes things to buy and makes it easy to buy them from Amazon. Success for Amazon will not necessarily be overtaking iPhones or Samsung phones, but wringing more money from its most loyal shoppers, on whatever device they want to shop. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s an attempt to overthrow Apple and Google and Samsung,\u201d said Benedict Evans, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, who writes a popular newsletter about the mobile industry. \u201cIt\u2019s locking in the top 10 percent most valuable customers more and more and more.

        "content": " Amazon\u2019s new phone has loads of features: the ability to recognize thousands of products in stores, supposedly tangle-free earbud cords and a screen that gives images the illusion of depth. Impressive, but the price for the Fire is $200, which doesn\u2019t seem very special. Apple, Samsung and others, after all, have phones for that price. Even if you consider that the price is really $100 because Amazon will give you a year of $99 Prime service \u2014 free delivery and free videos and streaming music \u2014 is it enough to switch? Since almost all people who might consider an Amazon phone have a smartphone already, many of them with apps that do the things that a Fire does, the cost of getting the Amazon Fire isn\u2019t $100. It is instead what economists call switching costs. The friction isn\u2019t a Benjamin in your wallet but the agony \u2014 or the belief there will be agony \u2014 of learning how to use it, of finding new apps, of loading those apps, of never again using a favorite app, of moving your contact list over, of losing all the text messages you sent, or of worrying that the movies and music you had on one system won\u2019t work on the other. How do you value that? It\u2019s easier to sit where you are. Why would you switch? When the existing technology you have falls behind. It happened to users of Palm phones, once as innovative as Apple or Amazon are. Millions of people have left their BlackBerrys behind, even though they loved the keyboard and messaging abilities, because it lacked so much else.

        "name": "BlackBerry to Add Amazon App Store to Phones ",
        "content": " OTTAWA \u2014 In a side story to  Amazon\u2019s expected move into the smartphone business , the ailing handset maker BlackBerry said on Wednesday that it would include Amazon\u2019s app store on its phones. John S. Chen, BlackBerry\u2019s chairman and chief executive, has repeatedly acknowledged that an absence of popular apps has hampered the company\u2019s BlackBerry 10 line of phones. Candy Crush Saga players, Netflix viewers and Pinterest shoppers were among those who were out of luck if they bought a BlackBerry. BlackBerry announced last year with much fanfare that the BlackBerry 10 phones would be able to use apps developed for Android, the Google mobile operating system, which Amazon has adopted for its phone. But apparently out of security and compatibility concerns, BlackBerry did not make installing Android apps straightforward, particularly at first. The company instead preferred that developers submit their Android apps for distribution through BlackBerry\u2019s app store. An upgrade of the BlackBerry operating system released in January eventually allowed users to download apps from Amazon\u2019s app store  through a process that was somewhat easier, if not entirely obvious . The new relationship with Amazon will make Amazon\u2019s store directly available on BlackBerry phones after another operating system upgrade, which is scheduled for this fall. BlackBerry will also help developers who have posted apps on its store to also include them on Amazon\u2019s. It was not immediately apparent if BlackBerry had found a way to deal with apps on Amazon\u2019s store that are not fully compatible with its phones. Lisette Kwong, a spokeswoman for BlackBerry, said that the company would continue to maintain its own app store after formally opening up its phones to Amazon. Asked why BlackBerry had not opened its phones to Google\u2019s app store as well, Ms. Kwong replied: \u201cWe explored, and continue to explore, various options to improve the services and user experience for our customers. This opportunity with the Amazon Appstore is the best opportunity we have for delivering a greater selection of apps for our users.\u201d Maynard Um, an analyst with Wells Fargo, suggested in a note to investors that the Amazon relationship was unlikely to reverse BlackBerry\u2019s slide. \u201cBroadly speaking, the announcement should be viewed positive, in our view, though, whether it stems consumer churn remains to be seen,\u201d Mr. Um wrote.",

        "content": " The company is expected to introduce a smartphone on Wednesday at an event in Seattle, a long-rumored project that aims to close any remaining gap between the impulse to buy and the real act. The company has spent the last several years investing billions of dollars on multiple fronts: constructing warehouses all over the United States to deliver goods as fast as possible, building devices as varied as tablets and set-top boxes, and creating and licensing entertainment to stock those devices. It adds up to an ambitious venture without precedent in modern merchandising. Wall Street has cheered, but competitors like Walmart, eBay, Apple and Google have regarded these activities with unease. Customers are propelling Amazon toward the rare ranks of companies with revenue of $100 billion. The phone is the last and most crucial link in this colossal enterprise. It is a singular gamble for a company that, for all its technology components, is still primarily a merchant. Because even the smartest technology companies have trouble with phones. A Google smartphone, the Nexus One, failed to catch on. Google next bought Motorola and then dumped it. BlackBerry, once the dominant smartphone maker, is struggling to survive. Microsoft\u2019s Windows Phone has less than 3 percent of the global market. A Facebook phone stumbled last year. When it comes to smartphone profits, Apple and Samsung divide them up, leaving crumbs for other companies. \u2018\u2018Mobile is asserting not just its utility but its supremacy,\u2019\u2019 said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019re Amazon, you\u2019re worried you\u2019re going to be cut out of the next big interface. So you jump in and make yourself relevant, whether your customer is in the bathroom, the kitchen or the car. You go for broke.\u2019\u2019 For Amazon, the risk of doing nothing is that it could be completely marginalized by one of its competitors. Mr. McQuivey offered the example of coconut flour. Search for the flour on Google, and Amazon comes up in two of the top responses, one of them an ad it paid for. In the future as designed by Google, however, the search engine will remember what you are looking for when you\u2019re out in the world and sell ads against that. So the next time you pass Trader Joe\u2019s, your Android phone sends a note: There is coconut flour just 50 feet away. If that sort of transaction starts happening too often, the coconut flour is going to go stale in Amazon\u2019s warehouses. In building a phone, Amazon has advantages other phone makers do not. It can sell to its 250 million customers without a middleman. It can bundle features with the Amazon Prime membership club, as it just did last week with a new streaming music service. Most of all, Amazon has the blessing of Wall Street to lose money as long as it is gaining market share \u2014 though recently the enthusiasm has dimmed a bit. The stock is about 20 percent off its peak. An early demonstration of what Amazon wants to do with shopping can be seen in the Dash, a wand that the company quietly introduced this year. Customers who belong to Amazon\u2019s grocery service can use the Dash, which scans bar codes and takes voice commands, to restock their refrigerator and cabinets. Imagine the Dash set free on the world and you have Amazon\u2019s long-term hopes for a phone. Sam Hall, an Amazon mobile executive, set forth the agenda in an interview a few years ago: \u2018\u2018We\u2019re trying to remove the barrier between \u2018I want that\u2019 and \u2018I have it.\u2019\u2019\u2019 An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on the event Wednesday. Reporters and the public were invited to apply to attend the event, and so were developers who had worked on apps using a phone\u2019s motion sensors. The developers were also asked if they had experience with \u2018\u2018machine learning,\u2019\u2019 which could mean Amazon is trying to design the phone so it can serve information based on behavior. For instance, say you bought a new camera on Amazon, searched for hotels in Florence, Italy, and downloaded a timetable for Italian trains; the company could ask you, Would you like to buy this passport holder? Special price, today only. Amazon at the moment is publicly fighting with several media suppliers, including Hachette and Warner Home Video in the United States and Bonnier in Germany. It wants better terms, as it nearly always does, and the media companies are resisting. Ironically, for all the criticism that Amazon\u2019s book business has generated recently, the company kicked off its event with an old-fashioned \u2014 in all senses of the word \u2014 book. On Friday, attendees received a 1965 children\u2019s tale, \u2018\u2018Mr. Pine\u2019s Purple House,\u2019\u2019 in the mail. It\u2019s about a man who wants to distinguish his house from the other houses on the street, so he paints it purple. Accompanying the book was a note from Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, saying that this was his favorite childhood book. \u2018\u2018I think you\u2019ll agree that the world is a better place when things are a little bit different,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos wrote.",

        "content": " Amazon introduced a music streaming feature on Thursday that gives subscribers to its Prime service access to thousands of songs free and without interruptions from advertising. The new feature, called Prime Music, which has been rumored in the music industry for months, has music from two of the three major record labels as well as various independents. But it omits most new releases and will not include the catalog of the Universal Music Group, the world\u2019s largest music company, as a result of strained negotiations over licensing terms. Amazon, already one of the biggest retailers of music downloads, is adding the streaming feature as a sweetener for its Prime customers, whose annual subscription fee was recently raised to $99 from $79. Prime subscribers get free two-day shipping on orders, and other perks like free streaming for some movies and television shows. Licensing negotiations with record labels and music publishers began about six months ago, but they were slowed by disagreements over financial terms that many music companies considered low. Amazon told most small labels that in exchange for one-year licensing agreements they would be offered shares of a $5 million royalty pool, to be divided by a market-share formula of Amazon\u2019s choosing, according to two people involved in the negotiations who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal. Bigger labels and distributors were offered larger one-time payments for a year of access to certain titles. Amazon initially offered a total of about $25 million in these fees; it was unclear whether the figure changed in negotiations. Sony and Warner Music, two of the three major labels, have signed such deals. But Universal, whose catalog includes stars like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Kanye West, did not reach an agreement with Amazon. With a relatively small catalog, Amazon\u2019s service is not seen as a major threat to companies like Spotify, Rhapsody and Beats Music, which offer millions of songs. But Amazon\u2019s sheer size gives it a big advantage. The company recently announced that it had 244 million active customer accounts.",

        "content": " Amazon, a relative baby in the field of technology services, triumphed over stalwart IBM to gain a $600 million Central Intelligence Agency contract, but the most remarkable part of the deal was that the agency was a cloud convert in the first place. The fact that a tech company could warehouse data involving the government\u2019s spies is the clearest signal yet that cloud computing is having its moment. Somewhat like outsourcing a decade ago, cloud computing is the coming technology destined to sweep away all before it. Amazon Web Services is the fastest-growing part of fast-growing Amazon, and analysts expect it someday to be the dominant part of the company. Google, IBM, Verizon, Microsoft and a host of smaller players are competing for a part of the action. Global spending on public cloud services alone is forecast to hit $210 billion in 2016, up 172 percent from 2010. And yet outsourcing provides a cautionary tale of how enthusiasm can be derailed by reality. Outsourcing advocates said every customer service call, every information technology fix, even the creation of routine legal documents was destined to be done in India or the Philippines. They said this would be cheaper and more efficient. They said American companies would be hollowed out. It didn\u2019t happen quite that way. While many companies outsourced routine tasks, some moved them back after complaints of poor service. Others never outsourced. Outsourcing was ultimately a segment of the market rather than becoming the market. Cloud computing is already confronting similar issues. Members of the Open Data Center Alliance, a consortium of global information technology companies like Infosys, Disney, Deutsche Telekom and SAP, are cloud enthusiasts. But in a recent alliance survey, two-thirds of the members said concerns about data security were delaying their move to the cloud. That was down from the 80 percent of respondents who expressed a concern about security the previous year. Other results, however, are headed away from cloud computing. Fifty-six percent now say regulatory issues will limit their adoption, up from 47 percent. And 47 percent worry about being tied to one vendor, up from 39 percent. Cloud computing \u2018\u2018is kind of in the first wave,\u2019\u2019 said Michael Masterson, director of cloud solutions for Compuware, which helps clients improve the performance of their applications. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it immature, but it\u2019s definitely Version 1.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Immature\u2019\u2019 is exactly what Roman Stanek would call it. Mr. Stanek founded GoodData in 2007 with the mission of disrupting business intelligence. Amazon had just started Amazon Web Services and GoodData became a client. It was not an entirely happy experience, Mr. Stanek said. \u2018\u2018Imagine if your electric company didn\u2019t know whether it would be up or down \u2014 if they told you, \u2018No guarantees, but we believe it will be mostly up,\u2019\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Maybe that works for some clients.\u2019\u2019 Amazon Web Services had well-publicized failures in October 2012, and two months later. But reliability is not a problem specific to Amazon. Mr. Masterson pointed out that Hewlett-Packard, which publishes its service agreements on the web, says it has 99.95 percent availability, which works out to about four hours of trouble a year. The service agreement also says a failure counts only if it lasts for more than six minutes. \u2018\u2018Imagine a company selling a premium new car whose warranty includes 2M piston revolutions, 10k door latch cycles, and 20k window open and closes,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Masterson wrote in a recent blog post. \u2018\u2018And even then, with 99.5 percent availability, you might still be unable to start the car two days a year, or during winter there might be two weeks where the doors won\u2019t unlock until the sun melts the ice in the door locks. Ready to buy?\u2019\u2019 Mr. Staten said the last companies to go to the cloud would be those that had no experience with it \u2014 hospitals, medical device makers, and architecture and construction companies. \u2018\u2018The reason they should go last is they don\u2019t yet know what they don\u2019t know,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018They\u2019ll start with applications that do not involve compliant data or customer data.\u2019\u2019 In general, he said, \u2018\u2018it\u2019s hard to make a case for organizations that should not go to cloud at all.\u2019\u2019 It is not like outsourcing, which faltered over communications issues and rising prices in the host countries, he said.",

        "content": " The Everything Store is shrinking again. Amazon customers who want to order forthcoming Warner Home Video features, including \u2018\u2018The Lego Movie,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018300: Rise of an Empire,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Winter\u2019s Tale\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Transcendence,\u2019\u2019 are finding it impossible to do so. The retailer\u2019s refusal to sell the movies is part of its effort to gain leverage in yet another major confrontation with a supplier to become public in recent weeks. In a standoff with the Hachette Book Group, Amazon is refusing to take advance orders and delaying shipments. Amazon and Hachette are wrangling over e-book terms. The retailer is in a third standoff in Germany, with the Bonnier Media Group. Disputes between retailers and vendors happen every day. What is unusual here is not Amazon\u2019s relentless desire to gain margin from its suppliers, but the suppliers\u2019 growing resolve to hold the line. If other suppliers adopt the same attitude, that might have significant implications for Amazon\u2019s pell-mell growth. The confrontations indicate that Amazon\u2019s long-stated desire to sell everything to everybody might be taking a back seat. The biggest book release in the middle of June is the new J.K. Rowling novel from Hachette; the biggest movie is \u2018\u2018Lego.\u2019\u2019 Amazon is basically telling its customers to go elsewhere for them, which is a very un-Amazon thing to do. Amazon started refusing preorders for the Time Warner movies in mid-May. That frustrated some customers, who voiced their displeasure on its forums. \u2018\u2018This has got to be the most eagerly awaited 2014 movie being released so far \u2014 kids\u2019 movie, adults like it too, the first good 2014 film,\u2019\u2019 one movie buff wrote about \u2018\u2018Lego.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Oh well, Amazon may be digging their own grave if they keep this up.\u2019\u2019 The retailer\u2019s page for the movies says that customers\u2019 only option is to sign up to be notified when they become available. \u2018\u2018The Lego Movie\u2019\u2019 is not even featured in Amazon\u2019s list of forthcoming \u2018\u2018Kids & Family\u2019\u2019 movies. Such lists are a big driver of preorders. The Blu-ray of \u2018\u2018The Lego Movie,\u2019\u2019 due out next week, languishes at No. 18,183. The Blu-ray of \u2018\u2018300\u2019\u2019 is ranked 105,389. A Warner Bros. spokesman said it was the company\u2019s \u2018\u2018general policy not to comment on contract terms or any other proprietary information having to do with our partners.\u2019\u2019 An Amazon spokesman declined to comment. In the middle of the Hachette confrontation, Amazon issued a statement saying disputes with suppliers were routine. It also said people who really wanted the books immediately should go to a competitor. There is no resolution in sight to the Hachette standoff. Amazon\u2019s tactics with Warner Home Video are unlikely to provoke as much of an uproar, since DVDs do not carry the cultural weight of books. And the films are readily available from other vendors, including Target and Barnes & Noble. Neither does Amazon seem to be imposing lengthy shipping delays on the DVDs once they go on sale, one of the things that provoked particular ire with Hachette. The delays with Hachette books took weeks to become public. So have the issues with the videos. \u2018\u2018Considering all the press regarding Hachette it seems strange that no one is reporting this,\u2019\u2019 one commentator wrote on the Amazon forum. One of the few websites that did notice something was going on with the movies was Digital Bits, which briefly noted that it had learned \u2018\u2018through industry sources\u2019\u2019 that \u2018\u2018preorders on Warner titles have been suspended\u2019\u2019 until there is a new contract.",

        "content": " Amazon, a relative baby in the field of technology services, triumphed over stalwart IBM to gain a $600 million C.I.A. contract, but the most remarkable part of the deal was that the agency was a cloud convert in the first place. The fact that a tech company could warehouse data involving the government's spies is the clearest signal yet that cloud computing is having its moment. Somewhat like outsourcing a decade ago, cloud computing is the coming technology destined to sweep away all before it. Amazon Web Services is the fastest-growing part of fast-growing Amazon, and analysts expect it someday to be the dominant part of the company. Google, IBM, Verizon, Microsoft and a host of smaller players are competing for a part of the action. Global spending on public cloud services alone is forecast to hit $210 billion in 2016, up 172 percent from 2010. And yet outsourcing provides a cautionary tale of how enthusiasm can be derailed by reality. Outsourcing advocates said every customer service call, every information technology fix, even the creation of routine legal documents was destined to be done in India or the Philippines. They said this would be cheaper and more efficient. American companies would be hollowed out, with only executives and their aides left on the payroll. It didn't happen quite that way. While many companies outsourced routine tasks, some moved them back after complaints of poor service. Others never outsourced. Outsourcing was ultimately a segment of the market rather than becoming the market. Cloud computing is already confronting similar issues. Members of the Open Data Center Alliance, a consortium of global information technology companies like Infosys, Disney, Deutsche Telekom and SAP, are cloud enthusiasts. But in a recent alliance survey, two-thirds of the members said concerns about data security were delaying their move to the cloud. That was down from the 80 percent of respondents who expressed a concern about security the previous year. Other results, however, are headed away from cloud computing. Fifty-six percent of members now say regulatory issues will limit their adoption, up from 47 percent. And 47 percent worry about being tied to one vendor, up from 39 percent. Cloud computing ''is kind of in the first wave,'' said Michael Masterson, director of cloud solutions for Compuware, which helps clients improve the performance of their applications. ''I don't know if I'd call it immature, but it's definitely Version 1.'' ''Immature'' is exactly what Roman Stanek would call it. Mr. Stanek founded GoodData in 2007 with the mission of disrupting business intelligence. Amazon had just started Amazon Web Services, and GoodData became a client. It was not an entirely happy experience, Mr. Stanek said. ''Imagine if your electric company didn't know whether it would be up or down -- if they told you, 'No guarantees, but we believe it will be mostly up,' '' he said. ''Maybe that works for some clients.'' Amazon Web Services had well-publicized failures in October 2012 and two months later. But reliability is not a problem specific to Amazon. Mr. Masterson pointed out that Hewlett-Packard, which publishes its service agreements on the web, says it has 99.95 percent availability, which works out to about four hours of trouble a year. The service agreement also says a failure only counts if it lasts for more than six minutes. ''Imagine a company selling a premium new car whose warranty includes 2M piston revolutions, 10k door latch cycles, and 20k window open and closes,'' Mr. Masterson wrote in a recent blog post. ''And even then, with 99.5 percent availability, you might still be unable to start the car two days a year, or during winter there might be two weeks where the doors won't unlock until the sun melts the ice in the door locks. Ready to buy?'' GoodData grew with Amazon. It has raised more than $75 million and has nearly 300 employees. But in the first quarter, the company left Amazon. It moved to a private cloud hosted by Rackspace, which is based near San Antonio. With Rackspace, it had more control. The only thing worse than a company offering unreliable service appears to be a company whose very existence is in doubt. Nirvanix was a cloud company based in San Diego with impressive backers, including Intel Capital and Khosla Ventures, and impressive hype. It was going to take on the big boys, Amazon Web Services and Google. Last Sept. 16, Nirvanix warned customers they had two weeks to retrieve their data. On Oct. 1, it filed for bankruptcy. Apparently all customers got their data out, but it was a near miss. Then last month Rackspace, whose stock dropped by half since the beginning of 2013, said it was hiring Morgan Stanley to advise it on a possible sale or merger. While profitable, Rackspace faces increasing competition. Companies that fail or are sold would matter less if data was more portable. ''It's still difficult to tap into Rackspace and change your mind, or tap into AWS and change to something else,'' said James Staten, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''We're a long way from sufficient standards where that's a possibility.'' Mr. Staten said the last companies to go to the cloud would be those that had no experience with it -- hospitals, medical device makers, and architecture and construction companies. ''The reason they should go last is they don't yet know what they don't know,'' he said. ''They'll start with applications that do not involve compliant data or customer data.'' In general, he said, ''it's hard to make a case for organizations that should not go to cloud at all.'' It is not like outsourcing, which faltered over communications issues and rising prices in the host countries, he said. GoodData expects to ultimately go full circle as competition increases. ''This used to be very much Amazon's monopoly, and a one-horse race was not good,'' Mr. Stanek said. ''That's why I'm happy to see Google get in. In a couple of years, you will be able to go to Google or Amazon and say, 'Give me the features I need, the service agreements and a good price, and I will have no reason to build my own cloud.'

        "content": " SEATTLE -- From his ninth-floor office in downtown Seattle, Hewlett-Packard's cloud computing outpost, Bill Hilf can see the Space Needle, the Pike Street Market and the future of computing. ''There's two security companies setting up over there,'' said Mr. Hilf, the vice president of cloud product management at HP, pointing east. Toward the waterfront is Blue Box, a cloud hosting company. South, in Pioneer Square, is a cloud engineering outpost of EMC, a data storage giant, as well as lots more start-ups. ''It's like Detroit used to be for car companies,'' he said. ''The galactic players are here, and they are creating lots of little companies. The only thing driving anyone away from here is the weather.'' Rain or shine, Seattle has quickly become the center of the most intensive engineering in cloud computing: the design and management of global-scale data centers. Last year, Mr. Hilf was hired from Microsoft's giant cloud business, Azure, to spearhead HP's efforts to build its own cloud service (based in Seattle, not at HP's home in Silicon Valley), and build technology for other cloud companies. It was a 13-minute drive from Microsoft to his new office, above the Seattle convention center. Amazon Web Services, the biggest of the cloud companies, is a six-minute walk from HP, in downtown Seattle. North over Queen Anne Hill, in the Fremont district, Google has a thousand engineers working on its cloud system. In Kirkland, near Microsoft, there is another Google facility. It's too early to say if this concentration of big engineering talent is sustainable over the long haul and whether it will evolve into a flywheel of innovation like Silicon Valley. For now, however, it appears to be attracting a lot of money and talent, eager to grow in the cloud. ''I could be completely wrong, but it seems like the valley is focusing on consumer stuff, like search and social, while we're building infrastructure, things that are a lot harder to learn,'' said Jared Wray, chief technology officer of cloud at CenturyLink, a large provider of Internet connectivity to business. ''There's a generational change.'' Last November, Mr. Wray's company, a provider of cloud computing services to small and midsize businesses called Tier 3, was bought by CenturyLink for an undisclosed sum. ''We've grown the engineering team 20 percent, to 100 people, since then,'' Mr. Wray said. ''They want to have 400.'' Besides talent that knows how to build infrastructure, Seattle has a number of leading cloud software companies. Tableau Software, a leader in the computer visualization of large sets of data, is across the street from Google in Fremont. Concur, used for online expense forms, is in Bellevue, near Microsoft Azure. Other companies include Chef, which produces open source cloud automation software; Apptio, a cloud monitoring company, and Socrata, which stores and publishes over 100,000 data sets for 150 government organizations. ''It's a little more collaborative than the valley, because we still have lots of hard problems to solve in cloud computing,'' said Kevin Merritt, founder and chief executive of Socrata. Others note that Washington State has tougher noncompete clauses in its labor laws than does California, which can give established firms some peace of mind about setting up shop in Seattle but frustrate venture capitalists by making it harder for people to walk out of one company and start a competitor. For all the action, Seattle still has only one major venture capital firm, compared with scores of such businesses in Silicon Valley. That firm, Madrona, has participated in 15 cloud deals since March 2012, raising $68 million of $304 million total venture capital for cloud companies in the Seattle area (the rest came from 20 other investors, mostly in the valley.) Those companies, all still private, are valued at $2.3 billion''This is the next two years,'' said Matt McIlwain, a partner at Madrona, standing before a whiteboard where he brainstormed more than 20 areas where new cloud businesses might be built. As for the ''relative dearth'' of venture money, he said, the increasing number of people getting rich at the area's new tech companies would bring in a lot of angel investors in Seattle. ''The big question in town is what Steve Ballmer will do with his money.'' Besides, perhaps, buy a basketball team in Los Angeles. (Mr. Ballmer, a former Microsoft chief executive, has agreed to pay $2 billion for the beleaguered Los Angeles Clippers.) The roots of Seattle's strength in cloud computing, longtime observers say, goes back to the mid-1990s, when Microsoft, long the sole big power in Seattle tech, began doing extensive work in distributed computing, or making computers work together in problem solving. That concept is the root of what cloud computing is today: lots of computer servers working together for various tasks. Several Microsoft veterans played key roles building out Amazon's cloud. In particular, James Hamilton, a former database specialist, is credited with making cloud computing far less expensive. Another factor is the growing presence of the University of Washington's computer science department, now considered a leader in distributed computing. ''There's an argument that Seattle owns the cloud now,'' said Ed Lazowska, who holds the Bill & Melinda Gates chair in Computer Science and Engineering at the university. ''Universities are always part of the axis'' in building out a regional tech center, he said. The university, which awards about 250 computer science degrees a year, is now working on courses in machine learning, which is how computers, particularly in the cloud, study and adapt based on big streams of data. ''The cloud and big data are closely connected,'' Mr. Lazowska said. ''We're incredibly lucky to be in Seattle.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Companies that shut down old-style data centers in favor of private or public clouds usually migrate data and applications to the new location. Cloud Computing: A method of configuring and delivering computing power on demand. Individual servers and storage, along with networks and software applications, are pooled and shared by various devices like smartphones and laptop computers, allowing easier use and higher performance. Usage is frequently metered, like a utility. Private Cloud: An instance of cloud computing by a single organization. It may be owned by the organization, or owned and managed by a third party. Public Cloud: Cloud infrastructure provided for use by the general public, often as a rental service. It may be owned and operated by an academic, government or private organization. The biggest public clouds are believed to belong to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure and Google's Compute Engine. But there are many others. N00b: Someone who is new to a subject. IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service. Basic computing resources, such as computer processing, networking, data storage and operating systems, offered through a network connection. Consumers usually pay a fee for usage of the infrastructure, which they can configure, add software applications to or use to handle overflows in periods of heavy usage. PaaS: Platform as a Service. A combination of infrastructure and basic computing resources used for coding and deploying software applications, usually for delivery over the Internet. AWS: Amazon Web Services. API: Application Programing Interface. A specification of how different software components can interact. Using a cloud API, a software developer can modify or customize a software application to suit the needs of a specific case. Companies are said to ''open'' their APIs when they want third parties to build new things on their product. SaaS: Software as a Service. Software applications offered as part of a cloud infrastructure, most often on a rental basis to businesses and consumers. Customers do not manage the underlying infrastructure, and receive automatic software updates through a network connection. CDN: Content Delivery Network. An interconnected system of computers in various locations that store duplicate copies of web content so it can be called up quickly. RFP: Request for Price. A term used to define the expectations in a contract. A company may describe what it needs and then ask for bidders to say how much it will cost them. Service Provider: An entity that provides individuals and entities access to the Internet or telecommunications services.. Streaming: Delivery of content, usually audio or video, to a connected device like a tablet. Netflix, for example, streams video to computers and Internet-connected televisions. Elastic Computing: Growing or shrinking the amount of computing resources used to meet different levels of demand. Amazon, for example, sees high demand on its sites on Thanksgiving weekend and in the week before Christmas, and needs additional computing resources. A cloud system is elastic to the degree it can respond to demand changes. Distributed Computing: A branch of computer science that deals with how two or more computers can solve problems by coordinated actions. Cloud computing is a complex specialized form of distributed computing. It is also used in things like multiplayer online games and peer-to-peer networks. Consumption-Based Pricing: Selling software and computing resources based on the amount consumed, rather than at a flat rate. Also called utility computing. Effort: In tech lingo, a way to describe spending time working on something; a synonym for work. Disruptive: A term that applies to new technologies that changes an old way of doing things. Spreadsheet programs, for example, disrupted doing accounting with pen and paper. Connected Device: Also called a Smart Device, an object connected to the Internet, usually to deliver and receive data. Connected devices may be phones and tablets, but increasingly include televisions and household appliances. Internet of Things: The idea of an Internet on which millions of industrial and personal objects are connected, usually through cloud systems. The objects would deliver sensor information, and possibly modify themselves, to create overall management of a larger system, like a factory or city. Google Glass: Computerized eyewear made by Google and now in wide testing. Soylent: A new, white drink favored by some in the tech industry that is supposed to provide the nutrients of regular food.

        "content": " Stephen Colbert went after Amazon Wednesday night, literally giving the retailer the finger on his Comedy Central show. Twice. \u201cI\u2019m not just mad at Amazon,\u201d  Mr. Colbert said   . \u201cI\u2019m Mad Prime.\u201d He showed a sticker that says, \u201cI didn\u2019t buy it on Amazon,\u201d  downloadable at his site   , and encouraged readers to put it on their books. Mr. Colbert\u2019s books are published by Hachette, and thus have fallen victim to Amazon\u2019s  well-publicized efforts   to pressure the publisher by making its books difficult to come by. Amazon is negotiating with Hachette over e-book prices but Hachette is balking at the terms. The dispute has blossomed into a debate about the power of Amazon and the value of publishers. After several weeks, Hachette sales are now dwindling on Amazon. Since Amazon is the biggest bookseller in the country, that is seriously affecting Hachette. On the other hand, the outrage seems to be mounting. While Amazon has its defenders \u2014 the novelist Barry Eisler  wrote in The Guardian this week   that the publishing industry has been run \u201cfor decades in a way that has benefited the few while stifling new opportunities for the many\u201d \u2013 they are greatly outnumbered by its critics. Mr. Colbert\u2019s 2012 book, \u201cAmerica Again: Re-Becoming the Greatness We Never Weren\u2019t,\u201d is marked on Amazon as \u201cusually ships in two to four weeks.\u201d To further discourage sales, the book sells at full price instead of the usual discount. Third parties do offer it on Amazon for as little as a penny but Mr. Colbert does not approve, saying \u201cpublishers and authors get no cash from used book sales. Plus you don\u2019t want them. Used books are the sluts of the literary world.\u201d He brought on a Hachette author, Sherman Alexie, who plugged the Hachette book, \u201cCalifornia,\u201d by Edan Lepucki. Mr. Colbert urged people to buy it at the independent Portland, Ore., store Powell\u2019s, tweeting to his six million followers, \u201cTogether we can #CutDownTheAmazon.\u201d Powell\u2019s struggled to keep up with the orders as \u201cCalifornia,\u201d a first novel, immediately became its No. 1 best-seller. Mr. Colbert\u2019s show followed the denunciation of Amazon earlier this week by John Green, author of the immensely popular \u201cThe Fault In Our Stars.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s ultimately at stake is whether Amazon is going to be able to freely and permanently bully publishers into eventual nonexistence,\u201d said Mr. Green, who is not published by Hachette. He was on tour for the movie based on the novel, which is being released Friday. Is it possible Amazon is beginning to crack under the pressure?  The Huffington Post   reported Wednesday that some Hachette books are now being restocked. It seems unlikely that any deal has been reached, the other obvious explanation.",

        "content": " Amazon, the online retailer, has often described itself as obsessed with making customers happy. But lately the company has been making some of its users extremely unhappy by making it hard or impossible for them to buy books published by the Hachette Book Group in the United States and delaying the deliveries of titles from the Bonnier Media Group in Germany. Details of the contract negotiations at the heart of these disputes are hard to come by. The negotiations reportedly deal with the pricing of electronic books, but the companies are not discussing them publicly. What seems clear is that Amazon is using its market power \u2014 the company accounts for about 40 percent of new books, print and digital, sold in the United States and more than 50 percent in Germany \u2014 to get the best deal for itself while it squeezes publishers, annoys its customers and hurts authors by limiting their sales. At one level, this dispute appears to be the kind of hard-nosed negotiations that always take place when distributors and producers try to figure out how to split the profits from a relatively new business, in this case e-books. Even as publishers battle Amazon, they themselves are facing demands from some authors and their agents for a bigger slice of e-book profits. Spirited price negotiations between buyers and sellers are a fundamental part of capitalism. But when a company dominates the sale of certain products as Amazon does with books, it has the power to distort the market for its own benefit and possibly in violation of antitrust laws. Legal experts say there is not enough evidence for the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division to investigate Amazon\u2019s treatment of Hachette. (In Germany, publishers have called on lawmakers to change antitrust laws so they can negotiate contracts jointly with Amazon.) But regulators should keep an eye on this case. There may be grounds to investigate Amazon if its squeezing of Hachette drags on or if it engages in similar actions against other publishers. It would be best if Amazon simply dropped its bullying tactics and spent its energy reaching agreements with Hachette and Bonnier. The longer this dispute drags on, the more likely it is that some readers will reconsider their relationship with Amazon and start buying books from other retailers. That would surely damage Amazon\u2019s goal of becoming the seller of everything to everyone.",

        "content": " Amazon, the online retailer, has often described itself as obsessed with making customers happy. But lately the company has been making some of its users extremely unhappy by making it hard or impossible for them to buy books published by the Hachette Book Group in the United States and delaying the deliveries of titles from the Bonnier Media Group in Germany. Details of the contract negotiations at the heart of these disputes are hard to come by. The negotiations reportedly deal with the pricing of electronic books, but the companies are not discussing them publicly. What seems clear is that Amazon is using its market power -- the company accounts for about 40 percent of new books, print and digital, sold in the United States and more than 50 percent in Germany -- to get the best deal for itself while it squeezes publishers, annoys its customers and hurts authors by limiting their sales. In a short statement about its dealings with Hachette, Amazon admitted that it was clamping down on the supply of Hachette's printed books by ordering fewer of them. The company said it was acting ''on behalf of customers'' and that this was essentially business as usual, or something retailers do ''every day.'' The company has used similar tactics in the past, against the publisher Macmillan and the Independent Publishers Group, a Chicago-based distributor for small presses. At one level, this dispute appears to be the kind of hard-nosed negotiations that always take place when distributors and producers try to figure out how to split the profits from a relatively new business, in this case e-books. Even as publishers battle Amazon, they themselves are facing demands from some authors and their agents for a bigger slice of e-book profits. Spirited price negotiations between buyers and sellers are a fundamental part of capitalism. But when a company dominates the sale of certain products as Amazon does with books, it has the power to distort the market for its own benefit and possibly in violation of antitrust laws. Legal experts say there is not enough evidence for the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department's antitrust division to investigate Amazon's treatment of Hachette. (In Germany, publishers have called on lawmakers to change antitrust laws so they can band together and negotiate contracts jointly with Amazon.) But regulators should keep an eye on this case. There may be grounds to investigate Amazon if its squeezing of Hachette drags on for months or if it engages in similar actions against other publishers. There is precedent for government involvement. In 2012, the Justice Department sued Apple and five large publishers, arguing that they illegally colluded to fix and raise the price of e-books. Publishers were unhappy that Amazon was deeply discounting some digital books and selling many for $9.99, which, in some cases, was lower than the wholesale cost of the e-book. Apple, by contrast, allowed publishers to set the retail price of e-books and took a commission on each sale. The publishers then forced Amazon to agree to adopt that model of selling e-books, too. The Justice Department eventually settled with the publishers and last year won its case against Apple, which is appealing the decision. The settlements and ruling against Apple allowed Amazon to again discount e-books, which led to lower prices but also strengthened Amazon's already strong position in that segment of the business. It would be best if Amazon simply dropped its bullying tactics and spent its energy reaching agreements with Hachette and Bonnier. The longer this dispute drags on, the more likely it is that some readers will reconsider their relationship with Amazon and start buying books from other retailers. That would surely damage Amazon's goal of becoming the seller of everything to everyone.",

        "content": " \u2018\u2018Fireman Sam,\u2019\u2019 a cartoon aimed at preschoolers, has long been a hit outside the United States. Now Mattel and Amazon are teaming up to sell the yellow-hatted hero to American children \u2014 a potentially controversial experiment that, if successful, could create a new model for marrying television shows with related merchandise. Amazon and Hit Entertainment, a division of Mattel, are creating an Amazon.com \u2018\u2018content hub\u2019\u2019 that will \u2014 side by side \u2014 offer episodes of \u2018\u2018Fireman Sam\u2019\u2019 and the opportunity to buy related toys, books, games, costumes, lunchboxes, T-shirts, hoses, hats, bags, footwear and bikes. Until now, Amazon has mostly kept the video streaming and retail sides of its business separate. \u2018\u2018This allows us to test the boundaries of how a kids\u2019 franchise can be activated,\u2019\u2019 said Sid Mathur, a Hit Entertainment vice president. \u2018\u2018At the same time, it allows Amazon to transition from a place that simply fulfills consumer demand to one that also creates consumer demand.\u2019\u2019 Fireman Sam episodes and themed merchandise will be sold exclusively at Amazon. About 75 episodes of the cartoon will be available by the end of the year, beginning with 13 on Tuesday; the related consumer products will arrive in October. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re always looking for ways to make parents\u2019 lives easier,\u2019\u2019 Peter Larsen, an Amazon vice president, said in a statement. The effort could agitate watchdog groups that monitor marketing to children. \u2018\u2018All of these kids\u2019 shows are made with consumer products in mind, but there is usually no direct link between watching the episode and buying the backpack,\u2019\u2019 said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. \u2018\u2018Does making it easier for consumers to act \u2014 what Amazon is all about \u2014 present a moral question in this case?\u2019\u2019 If the cartoon were to run on a traditional television channel, Mr. McQuivey noted, Mattel would be barred from placing ads for Fireman Sam toys during the show or \u2018\u2018adjacent\u2019\u2019 to it under the rules of the Children\u2019s Advertising Review Unit, a division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The Federal Communications Commission also regulates advertising in children\u2019s television. But the Internet is murkier territory. And exactly what constitutes an ad on a shopping site like Amazon, anyway? While Fireman Sam episodes and merchandise will be offered on the same page on Amazon\u2019s primary site, Amazon said it expected children to watch the cartoon through one of its walled services. Kindle FreeTime, for instance, is a subscription-based streaming service that gives children access to preselected shows but prevents them from visiting Amazon\u2019s retail pages or the broader web. \u2018\u2018Kindle FreeTime doesn\u2019t allow kids to buy things and contains no ads,\u2019\u2019 Nate Glissmeyer, Amazon\u2019s director of digital product management, Kids and Kindle Products, said in an interview. As for Amazon\u2019s interest in Fireman Sam, Mr. Glissmeyer said, \u2018\u2018He\u2019s about being helpful, which I think is a great message for kids.\u2019\u2019 The animated firefighter, introduced in Britain in 1985 and aimed at children ages 2 to 5, in recent years has appeared in a limited fashion on Sprout, an American cable channel for preschoolers now owned by NBCUniversal. But the character has never taken off in the United States, in part because Hit Entertainment has been focused on two bigger properties: Thomas & Friends and Bob the Builder. Mattel, which bought Hit Entertainment in 2011 for $680 million, has made popularizing Fireman Sam a priority. Based in El Segundo, Calif., Mattel had a terrible holiday season last year, with sales at its core Fisher-Price preschool unit dropping 13 percent; Barbie also sputtered. The toy company could have used a time-tested method to ignite interest in Fireman Sam: Sell the show to a TV channel, hope for a big audience and then use ratings to persuade retailers to devote shelf space to themed merchandise. If everything went like clockwork, it would have taken a year to get items in stores. But eager to speed up the process \u2014 and mindful that children are increasingly consuming cartoons through streaming services and on-demand apps \u2014 Hit Entertainment instead approached Amazon. \u2018\u2018Netflix would have brought reach to a certain set of consumers, but Amazon brought that and something else, namely a giant retail platform,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Mathur said. Analysts say Amazon\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest online retailer is emerging as a significant point of leverage in its battle with Netflix for video programming, at least in certain categories like children\u2019s entertainment. (Nickelodeon left Netflix for Amazon last year as part of a deal valued at several hundred million dollars.) \u2018\u2018This is a sign of things to come,\u2019\u2019 Mr. McQuivey said of the Fireman Sam partnership, noting that Amazon could easily make similar merchandising deals with home decorating, cooking and health and fitness shows. \u2018\u2018These programs are product placement from beginning to end,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Amazon is perhaps the only video distributor in the world that can let people immediately act on those impulses.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " As a young book editor at Little, Brown & Company in 1992, Michael Pietsch paid $80,000 -- $45,000 more than the next-highest bidder -- for a postmodern novel by a little-known writer named David Foster Wallace. He spent years urging Mr. Wallace to cut hundreds of pages from the sprawling manuscript and impose at least some structure on the disparate plot strands. The book, ''Infinite Jest,'' was finally published in 1996 and became an instant literary sensation. Mr. Pietsch is now chief executive of Little, Brown's parent company, the Hachette Book Group, and is engaged in a very different sort of battle -- not with a fragile author, but with one of the most powerful corporations in the United States: Amazon. As the first chief executive of a major publishing house to negotiate new terms with Amazon since the Justice Department sued five publishers in 2012 for conspiring to raise e-book prices, Mr. Pietsch finds himself fighting not just for the future of Hachette, but for that of every publisher that works with Amazon. ''In a sense, Michael Pietsch is like 'Horatius at the Bridge,' '' says the literary agent and former Amazon executive Laurence J. Kirshbaum, referring to the soldier of legend who single-handedly saved ancient Rome by fighting off an invading army. ''He is carrying the rest of the industry on his back.'' Because Hachette and Amazon have signed confidentiality agreements as part of their negotiations, the particulars of their dispute have been kept secret. But inside the publishing world, the consensus is that Amazon wants to offer deep discounts on Hachette's electronic books, and that the negotiations are not going well. The proudly customer-friendly Amazon is delaying shipments and preventing preorders of certain Hachette books, suggesting to potentially frustrated shoppers that they buy them elsewhere. Mr. Pietsch (pronounced peach), ordinarily easygoing and accessible, is refusing to talk to the news media and has told employees to do the same. There is little question that Mr. Pietsch, 56, would not be squaring off against the country's largest bookseller if it were not an absolute necessity for his company's bottom line. Friends say he never wanted the negotiations to become public. But now that they have, everyone in the book industry is watching and waiting. ''We're all Hachette now,'' one publisher joked last week at the trade fair BookExpo America in Manhattan. Given his background, Mr. Pietsch, is an unlikely figure to find himself in such a position. He is trained as an editor, not a businessman. He took over Hachette in April 2013, trading a life of poring over manuscripts for one of scrutinizing spreadsheets. Like a player-coach, though, he has continued to acquire and edit a small handful of books, most notably Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ''The Goldfinch.'' He has built an all-star stable of authors that includes highbrow writers as well as mass-market giants like Michael Connelly and James Patterson. It is unusual for a lifelong editor to become C.E.O. of his own publishing company, but over the years, Mr. Pietsch had developed a reputation as both a man of letters and a shrewd deal maker. The combination could serve him well in his dispute with Amazon. ''While I don't envy his position in this street fight, I think he's exactly the right guy to be conducting it,'' said Sloan Harris, an agent at International Creative Management. The son of an Army officer, Mr. Pietsch grew up in Norfolk, Va. He attended Harvard, where he concentrated in English and wrote his senior thesis on Chaucer's 14th-century work ''The Canterbury Tales.'' During his senior year, Mr. Pietsch interned at a publisher based in Boston, David R. Godine, and liked it so much that he stayed on after graduating. He eventually moved to New York and spent six years at Scribner -- among other things, editing an unpublished Ernest Hemingway manuscript -- before joining Little, Brown as an editor in 1991. Over the next 10 years, Mr. Pietsch helped transform the company from a sleepy, largely literary house, to a modern, commercial publisher. Mr. Pietsch worked his way up through the ranks there, becoming editor in chief in 1998 and publisher in 2001. Even as a publisher, he was known for being hands-on. After Mr. Wallace committed suicide in 2008, Mr. Pietsch painstakingly assembled the thousands of typed and handwritten manuscript pages that Mr. Wallace had left behind into a posthumously published novel. He also wrote the introduction to that book, ''The Pale King.'' A resident of Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., Mr. Pietsch is married to Janet Vultee Pietsch, a children's book editor. As Hachette's chief executive, he now oversees not just Little, Brown but all of the publisher's imprints, which together put out about 1,000 books every year. Hachette has been largely silent since the dispute broke out into the public last month, though it did issue a public statement -- written by Mr. Pietsch -- that underscored its view that books deserve to be treated differently from hard drives, diapers and the countless other products that Amazon sells. ''Amazon indicates that it considers books to be like any other consumer good,'' the statement said. ''They are not.'' Mr. Pietsch received support from one of his authors, Mr. Patterson, who went on a tirade during a luncheon speech last week at BookExpo. ''Amazon also, as you know, wants to control bookselling, book buying, and even book publishing, and that is a national tragedy,'' he said. Mr. Pietsch's central role in his industry's dispute with Amazon seems to be nothing more than sheer happenstance. As part of Hachette's antitrust settlement with the government, the company agreed to allow Amazon to continue to discount the price of e-books for two years. That agreement has expired, and for some reason -- no one is sure why -- Hachette is the first publisher to find itself in the position of negotiating a new one. Other publishers are holding their breath. It is in their interests for Mr. Pietsch to drive a hard bargain, and they are cheering him on, but silently. They have their own relationships with Amazon to protect, and they do not want anything they say to be construed as antagonistic, all the more so now that Amazon has demonstrated its willingness to punish booksellers when negotiations become contentious. If Mr. Pietsch is a hero to some, he is a reluctant one. ''He doesn't want to be seen as the warrior against Amazon,'' said Mr. Wallace's agent, Bonnie Nadell, who has known Mr. Pietsch for 25 years. ''I think that makes him incredibly uncomfortable.''

        "content": " Updated, 9:07 p.m. | In the dispute between Amazon and Hachette, neither side is blinking. Amazon has been discouraging sales of books published by Hachette in an effort to make the publisher come to terms on a new contract for e-books. The confrontation has dominated publishing and bookselling circles. Amazon has been heavily criticized for using writers as pawns, although it also has its defenders. Last week, Amazon increased the pressure on Hachette by refusing to let customers order future books. Since advance orders are used to determine print runs, even the biggest books will be affected. Amazon is about a third of most publishers' physical sales, presumably including Hachette. Amazon's competitors are trying to seize the advantage. Walmart.com, for instance, is promoting Hachette titles at 40 percent off, and said Friday that its online book sales had jumped as a result. Many Hachette authors have weighed in. James Patterson was vehement in his criticism of Amazon, which he repeated at the booksellers' convention in New York this week. But there was one voice that was notably absent: that of Malcolm Gladwell, author of ''David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants,'' ''The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference'' and other extremely popular social science books. Amazon has trimmed or eliminated the discount on most of his books or added weeks to the shipping time, or both. In Germany, Mr. Gladwell is published by Bonnier, whose books Amazon is also discouraging shoppers from buying. In his first interview on the clash, Mr. Gladwell did not quite say he felt betrayed by Amazon, but said he was ''surprised and puzzled'' by its actions. Here's a lightly edited account of the conversation: Q. You've been silent since this story broke. A. I was initially asked by Hachette to give them some time to negotiate. It's easier when things are not being hashed out in the press. But several weeks have passed, so maybe it is appropriate for me to say something. Q. Let's hear it. A. It's sort of heartbreaking when your partner turns on you. Over the past 15 years, I have sold millions of dollars' worth of books on Amazon, which means I have made millions of dollars for Amazon. I would have thought I was one of their best assets. I thought we were partners in a business that has done well. This seems an odd way to treat someone who has made you millions of dollars. Q. What is happening to your sales? A. They have been profoundly affected. Where Amazon used to sell two copies, now it sells one. It's a pretty big decline. Q. Why is Amazon doing this? A. I'm not privy to the negotiations. But it's puzzling. Authors like James Patterson and J. K. Rowling drive millions and millions of people to the Amazon site, where presumably they buy everything else Amazon is selling. Why would Amazon turn around and bite the hand that feeds them? Q. Some people think Amazon is hoping to drive a wedge between you and Hachette, so you sign your next book with someone else -- or even with Amazon itself. Then, the theory goes, Hachette will be weak and Amazon can get the contract it wants. A. That strategy is too counterintuitive even for me. I don't think human beings reward those who hurt them. If Amazon wanted me to do something in their interest, I imagine they would do something in my interest. This isn't. Q. Most people think Amazon is the Goliath here, although some argue that this is Goliath vs. Goliath. A. There's no question who is more powerful here: Amazon. Q. So is there a way for the underdog to triumph here, like the cases you recount in ''David and Goliath''? A. I don't think the appropriate framework here is a battle between two people. It's a partnership. My publishers, Amazon and I have been in business together, an extremely successful business. We should all be celebrating together instead of fighting. Q. Amazon's critics would say you were na\u00efve about this being a true partnership. A. I don't think it was destined to blow up. And I don't think it's entirely impossible to fix. We need Amazon and Amazon needs us. That's a classic partnership. Q. Are you personally taking any action? A. I've had the position I need to respect the rights of these two parties to negotiate. I didn't think to insert myself. But if this keeps going, the authors are going to have to get together. It's Hachette now, but I don't think anyone is under any illusions it stops with Hachette. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Gladwell or his remarks. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",

        "name": "What is Amazon up to? Maybe it needs the money; One theory about why the retail giant is willing to risk being vilified ",
        "content": " Over the course of nearly two decades, Amazon has hewed to a consistent philosophy: It\u2019s all about the customer. The retailer is so devoted to its customers that it takes the profit that would normally go to shareholders and gives it to shoppers in the form of faster delivery and lower prices. It is a brilliant strategy that has propelled the company to the top ranks of American businesses. So when Amazon took the rare step of explaining why it decided to hold hostage 5,000 Hachette books when contract negotiations with the publisher failed, it once again said it was all about the customer. \u2018\u2018When we negotiate with suppliers, we are doing so on behalf of customers,\u2019\u2019 the retailer said in an unusual statement. \u2018\u2018Negotiating for acceptable terms is an essential business practice that is critical to keeping service and value high for customers in the medium and long term.\u2019\u2019 Amazon suggested that anyone who really wanted a Hachette book should go elsewhere. In other words, Amazon is willing to alienate those customers upon which it usually lavishes so much attention. And it is willing to be vilified on the Internet for undermining writers, further denting its reputation. To make all that trouble worthwhile, the goal must be pretty tempting. Amazon has not really explained what it is after, but here is one compelling theory: The company just doesn\u2019t have enough money to finance everything it wants to do. Rather than trim its ambitions, it is putting one side of its business through the wringer to pay for another. It\u2019s no coincidence that the confrontation with Hachette in the United States \u2014 and Bonnier in Germany \u2014 comes as Wall Street is getting a little restless with Amazon. The retailer has been doing its best to tighten its business, including raising the cost of its Prime membership program. It chopped the royalty rate for self-published audio books. And publishers and customers say books on the site are getting more expensive. (Amazon has hotly denied this.) At the same time, however, Amazon is restlessly expanding. It is paying HBO $300 million for the rights to stream programs like \u2018\u2018The Sopranos\u2019\u2019 free to Prime customers. It was reported on Thursday to be introducing a streaming music service this summer. There are new warehouses galore. An Amazon phone is a persistent rumor. All of this development takes money, so even with the tightening, Amazon is barely making a profit. Amazon has issued no statement about how it is working for its customers in Germany. It could not pass on to them any savings it achieved in negotiations even if it wanted to, because books have fixed prices in Germany. There seems a bit of confusion over what is happening in Germany. In its statement, Amazon recommended a blog that makes a strident defense for the company; it\u2019s from a Long Island outfit, the Permanent Press. The blog post says Bonnier is \u2018\u2018known primarily for publishing magazines throughout the Western world and far fewer books.\u2019\u2019 Surely Amazon knows better than this, even if the Permanent Press does not. Bonnier Media Germany belongs to the Bonnier Media Group, which is based in Sweden. It includes nine German-language publishers of fiction, nonfiction, children\u2019s literature and comics. Bonnier is the third-largest publishing group in Germany, after Random House and Holtzbrinck. Internationally known authors published by Bonnier Germany include Isabel Allende, John le Carr\u00e9, J.K. Rowling, Malcolm Gladwell, Elizabeth Gilbert and William Boyd. Price negotiations between Amazon and German publishers take place annually and normally last only a month. Bonnier and Amazon started negotiating late last year but have not been able to agree on how to divide the take from e-books. Some people in the German publishing world believe that Amazon focused on Bonnier because it was big enough to set a precedent but was not one of the two heavyweights. The German pricing law exists to prevent any bookseller from undercutting their rivals. The law is rooted in the country\u2019s belief that books are a necessity to a free-thinking, pluralistic society; one of the most moving monuments to the Nazi-era terror is a white room full of empty bookshelves recalling the volumes burned in 1933. The law is also considered a measure to ensure the survival of smaller bookshops and publishers. This does not sound like hospitable territory for Amazon, but the company is selling a lot of books in Germany. That must further increase the ire of small booksellers and independent publishers. They view the online giant\u2019s tactics against Bonnier as a political statement against their way of life. \u2018\u2018The use of its market position to purposely delay delivery of books from selected publishers in order to pressure them to accept their demands for conditions is not only a threatening sign for the book industry, but a clear affront to those who read and buy books,\u2019\u2019 wrote a group of some 880 independent booksellers and publishers, members of a loose organization that calls itself the Booksellersmeeting in protest against Amazon\u2019s action. Amazon, which has the further problem of labor troubles in Germany, does not seem worried. Perhaps it is confident the complaints will blow over. And perhaps it really needs the money.",

        "content": " A strong contender for quote of the month comes from Dennis Loy Johnson, of the small publishing firm Melville House. ''How is this not extortion?'' he said to David Streitfeld and Melissa Eddy of The Times, in a story published last week. ''You know, that thing that is illegal when the Mafia does it.'' He was referring to Amazon. As you've undoubtedly heard, Amazon and Hachette, the big publishing house, are in a pricing dispute. Pricing disputes, of course, take place all the time, but they don't usually include accusations of extortion. Walmart became a giant, low-cost retailer by constantly squeezing its suppliers for better -- i.e. lower -- prices. Cable companies regularly get into pricing squabbles with television networks. Even in the book business, pricing disputes are not uncommon. In its heyday, Barnes & Noble was constantly fighting with publishers to get better prices, so it could offer bigger discounts on best-selling books. But Barnes & Noble never had the kind of power that Amazon has. Publishers Weekly reports that in March, Amazon commanded 41 percent of all new books sold, and a staggering 65 percent of all online books sold, whether print or digital, according to research conducted by the Codex Group. Borders, a once-viable bookseller, is gone. Barnes & Noble has never been terribly successful as an online store, and its Nook e-reader is a dismal failure. Independent booksellers have been marginalized. Over the years, as Amazon became increasingly powerful, publishers began whispering about how someday that power would be abused. Amazon has always pushed hard for the lowest price possible, but what would happen if it truly became a monopoly? Wouldn't it then be able to raise prices at will, hurting book buyers? As its dispute with Hachette illustrates, Amazon is more than willing to flex its powerful muscles. It can now take weeks instead of days to get a Hachette-published book from Amazon. Amazon won't allow customers to pre-order Hachette books before they are published. Earlier this week, Amazon put out a statement acknowledging that it was doing these things because of the dispute. But its goal is not to raise prices, which is contrary to Amazon's pro-consumer culture. Instead, it is trying to upend the economic model that has long sustained book publishers. No wonder the stakes feel so high, and the fear and loathing so palpable. The story really began some years ago, when Amazon began issuing a standard price for e-books of $9.99 -- in some cases selling below cost. Publishers feared that they would become locked into the $9.99 price the same way the music industry had been locked into 99-cent songs by Apple's iTunes service. They fought back by joining forces with Apple, cutting preferable deals to participate in Apple's e-book-selling service, and then forcing Amazon to go along with the same terms. E-book prices quickly rose. Unfortunately for the publishers, their brilliant idea turned out to be an illegal conspiracy, and the government forced them to settle on terms that had the effect of boosting Amazon. Although Amazon has not entirely reverted back to $9.99 e-books, it could if it wanted to, and it has in some cases. In other cases -- especially with self-published books or romances -- e-book prices are down to $5.99 and even $2.99. ''There is a strong gravitational pull downward,'' said one publisher (who did not want to be quoted, fearing Amazon's wrath). The way I hear it, what Amazon is insisting upon is a deal where it would no longer have to bear the full brunt of its discounting -- the publisher would have to bear some of it, in the form of tighter margins, or even losses. Hachette, meanwhile, contends that it needs to be compensated for the important things publishers do: editing, marketing, and curating. This is an argument that may appeal to the cultural elite, but it is unlikely to move Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive. Publishers, he has been known to say, are gatekeepers. ''Even well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation,'' he wrote in his 2011 letter to shareholders, according to Brad Stone, the author of a recent book about Amazon, ''The Everything Store.'' No matter what you think of Amazon's tactics, they surely don't violate any laws. It is acting the way hardheaded companies usually act -- inflicting some pain on the party in a dispute to move it toward resolution. On some level, the book industry has never fit comfortably in the contours of big business. But over the years, as one house after another was bought by conglomerates, as they merged with each other, as they tried to increase profits with the kind of regularity that pleases Wall Street, they began the process of commoditizing books.",

        "content": " Updated, 9:07 p.m. | In the dispute between Amazon and Hachette, neither side is blinking. Amazon has been discouraging sales of books published by Hachette in an effort to make the publisher come to terms on a new contract for e-books.  The confrontation has dominated   publishing and bookselling circles. Amazon has been heavily criticized for using writers as pawns, although it also has its defenders. Last week, Amazon  increased the pressure   on Hachette by refusing to let customers order future books. Since advance orders are used to determine print runs, even the biggest books will be affected. Amazon is about a third of most publishers\u2019 physical sales, presumably including Hachette. Amazon\u2019s competitors are trying to seize the advantage. Walmart.com, for instance, is promoting Hachette titles at 40 percent off, and said Friday that its online book sales had jumped as a result. Many Hachette authors have weighed in. James Patterson was vehement in his criticism of Amazon, which he  repeated at the booksellers\u2019 convention   in New York this week. But there was one voice that was notably absent: that of Malcolm Gladwell, author of \u201cDavid and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants,\u201d \u201cThe Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference\u201d and other extremely popular social science books. Amazon has trimmed or eliminated the discount on most of his books or added weeks to the shipping time, or both. In Germany, Mr. Gladwell is published by Bonnier, whose books Amazon is also discouraging shoppers from buying. In his first interview on the clash, Mr. Gladwell did not quite say he felt betrayed by Amazon, but said he was \u201csurprised and puzzled\u201d by its actions. Here\u2019s a lightly edited account of the conversation: Q. You\u2019ve been silent since this story broke. A. I was initially asked by Hachette to give them some time to negotiate. It\u2019s easier when things are not being hashed out in the press. But several weeks have passed, so maybe it is appropriate for me to say something. Q. Let\u2019s hear it. A. It\u2019s sort of heartbreaking when your partner turns on you. Over the past 15 years, I have sold millions of dollars\u2019 worth of books on Amazon, which means I have made millions of dollars for Amazon. I would have thought I was one of their best assets. I thought we were partners in a business that has done well. This seems an odd way to treat someone who has made you millions of dollars. Q. What is happening to your sales? A. They have been profoundly affected. Where Amazon used to sell two copies, now it sells one. It\u2019s a pretty big decline. Q. Why is Amazon doing this? A. I\u2019m not privy to the negotiations. But it\u2019s puzzling. Authors like James Patterson and J. K. Rowling drive millions and millions of people to the Amazon site, where presumably they buy everything else Amazon is selling. Why would Amazon turn around and bite the hand that feeds them? Q. Some people think Amazon is hoping to drive a wedge between you and Hachette, so you sign your next book with someone else \u2014 or even with Amazon itself. Then, the theory goes, Hachette will be weak and Amazon can get the contract it wants. A. That strategy is too counterintuitive even for me. I don\u2019t think human beings reward those who hurt them. If Amazon wanted me to do something in their interest, I imagine they would do something in my interest. This isn\u2019t. Q. Most people think Amazon is the Goliath here, although some argue that this is Goliath vs. Goliath. A. There\u2019s no question who is more powerful here: Amazon. Q. So is there a way for the underdog to triumph here, like the cases you recount in \u201cDavid and Goliath\u201d? A. I don\u2019t think the appropriate framework here is a battle between two people. It\u2019s a partnership. My publishers, Amazon and I have been in business together, an extremely successful business. We should all be celebrating together instead of fighting. Q. Amazon\u2019s critics would say you were na\u00efve about this being a true partnership. A. I don\u2019t think it was destined to blow up. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely impossible to fix. We need Amazon and Amazon needs us. That\u2019s a classic partnership. Q. Are you personally taking any action? A. I\u2019ve had the position I need to respect the rights of these two parties to negotiate. I didn\u2019t think to insert myself. But if this keeps going, the authors are going to have to get together. It\u2019s Hachette now, but I don\u2019t think anyone is under any illusions it stops with Hachette.",

        "content": " Amazon and Hachette took their cases to the public on Wednesday as a dispute over contract terms became clashing visions about the distribution of information in the digital age. On one side is a publisher whose roots stretch back to 1837. On the other is a technology company that has single-handedly upended just about every part of the relationship between readers and their books. The publishing community, which is assembling in New York this week for the annual bookselling show, is watching in uneasy fascination. Publishers know that whatever terms Hachette ends up with, they will all get. ''The issues at play are a matter of life and death for Hachette,'' said Jeremy Greenfield, editorial director of Digital Book World. ''This is about controlling the future of book publishing.'' Amazon wants to do away with gatekeepers. It promises a world where books are cheap, where anyone can publish anything, where there are no editors or distributors saying this is not what is selling now, go away. Hachette is holding fast to the traditional publishing system that underpins modern culture. It was a world where publishers bankrolled writers in return for a large cut of the proceeds, where editors improved prose and sharpened arguments, and where books were selected and presented rather than simply released. They cost more, too. ''Amazon indicates that it considers books to be like any other consumer good,'' Hachette said in a statement. ''They are not.'' There are many considerations here besides money, the publisher said, noting that authors are engaging ''in a complex and difficult mission to communicate with readers.'' It added, ''In addition to royalties, they are concerned with audience, career, culture, education, art, entertainment and connection.'' The only thing the publisher and the retailer agree on is that there is no deal in sight, and 5,000 Hachette books are caught in the middle. Amazon said that if customers ordered them, it would ship them -- eventually. ''We are not optimistic that this will be resolved soon,'' Amazon said in its statement. Hachette said any resolution would have to ''value appropriately'' the publisher's role in editing, marketing and distributing books. In Amazon's mission to remove all barriers between readers and writers, the biggest obstacle is the New York publishers, which for the most part still publish the writers whom people want to read. But Amazon controls the Kindle e-reader platform and sees no reason a publisher like Hachette should receive so much of the revenue from a digital book. That was where the negotiations failed. The eventual winner is hard to forecast. Amazon faces criticism across the Internet, so much so that it complained in its statement about the voluminous coverage expressing ''a relatively narrow point of view.'' Amazon promoted instead a small publisher's blog that offered a ''wider'' -- as in, pro-Amazon -- perspective. Authors published by the traditional houses, including Hachette, argue that their livelihood is at stake, and that the world where Amazon is the only gatekeeper would be a deeply problematic one. There have been vows of boycotts. But Amazon is content to play the long game, as usual, and seems confident that Hachette authors will ultimately grow restive and blame the publisher. The publisher's oldest line is Little, Brown, which has published books like Edward Gibbon's ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' and David Foster Wallace's ''Infinite Jest.'' One thing is clear: The publishing business, once a profession for gentlemen, now resembles ''The Sopranos'' -- which Amazon just paid handsomely for the rights to stream. The origins of the current confrontation go back at least four years. When Amazon felt threatened then by publishers demanding a different pricing system for e-books, it had two responses: It removed the ''buy'' buttons from one publisher, and sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission with accusations of illegal behavior. The buttons were soon restored, but the publishers were hit by a government antitrust suit whose consequences are still being felt. Now the situation is reversed, with Amazon in the dominant position. Is there a role for regulators this time around? According to a leading antitrust lawyer, there might be. ''This situation is rife with antitrust risk'' for Amazon, said William MacLeod, chairman of the antitrust and competition practice group at the Washington firm Kelley Drye. ''Under U.S. law, even a monopolist can refuse to deal or can charge what the market will bear,\" said Mr. MacLeod, the former director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection. ''But if the activity has the potential to create or entrench market power, a company's exclusionary conduct or imposition of onerous terms could indeed run afoul of the law.'' Amazon declined to comment on Wednesday on antitrust topics. While it issued its statement defending itself, it also tried to take a nothing-to-see-here approach. ''This business interruption affects a small percentage of Amazon's demand-weighted units,'' it pointed out. (Demand-weighted means the things that people are actually buying.) If customers really wanted any of those 5,000 Hachette books immediately, Amazon said, they could go ''to one of our competitors.'' It was an extraordinary declaration from a company that has striven to be the ''everything'' store, merchandising an ever-increasing pile of goods in ever-increasing ways. The retailer has had great success in reworking the publishing industry, partly because it has focused so relentlessly on customers that they always knew they were getting a better deal. Thanks to Wall Street's unwavering support, Amazon could afford to sell books for what it paid for them -- something no physical bookseller could do. It also paid higher royalty rates on e-books it published itself than the traditional publishers did on their e-books. All those editors and other legacy overhead needed their cut. But even those who believed Amazon was ushering in a utopia of publishing were jolted a few months ago when it abruptly chopped the royalty rates on self-published audiobooks. ''I'm shocked that Amazon would do anything to fuel the speculation that once they grow big enough, authors will suffer,'' wrote Hugh Howey, an author who is usually a champion of Amazon's way of doing things.

        "content": " Q. I know I have to pay extra, but how do I turn off the commercials on my Kindle Fire screen? A. Amazon refers to certain Fire tablet and e-readers as ''Kindle With Special Offers.'' These ''special offers'' -- or as many people call them, advertisements -- appear as screen savers, on the lock screen or at the bottom of the home screen. Amazon also has ''limited time special offers'' on newer Kindle Fire models to provide discounts on selected items, as explained at amazon.com/exclusivefireoffers. While the ads do not appear on the pages of books you buy for the Kindle, they do subsidize the overall cost of the hardware. To pay for ad removal, log into your Amazon account at amazon.com/manageyourkindle or go to the Your Account page and in the Digital Content area, click on ''Manage Your Content and Devices.'' Next, click on ''Manage Your Devices'' and select your Kindle to display its details. Next to ''Special Offers,'' click Edit and follow along. Depending on the type of Kindle, it typically costs $15 or $20 to unsubscribe from the special offers -- which is around the price difference with the Kindle models that come ad-free out of the box. Once you unsubscribe, your Amazon account is billed accordingly. Using an iPad As the Hot Spot Q. If my home broadband connection goes out, how hard is it to turn my new 4G iPad into a mobile hot spot so I can get my laptop online? A. Sharing the iPad's cellular-data connection -- and its monthly allowance -- with your laptop through the Personal Hotspot feature in iOS 7 is not difficult, although you should contact your wireless carrier to see if any additional fees or particular data plans are required. AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon all offer cellular iPads now and also have information about using the personal hot spot, also known as ''tethering,'' on their websites. Some prepaid data plans, like those from Verizon, include mobile hot spot use. You may also get a link to contact your carrier the first time you set up the Personal Hotspot feature. On the iPad's home screen, open the Settings icon and select Cellular Data. Tap the ''Personal Hotspot'' option and follow the instructions on screen. Apple has detailed setup steps at support.apple.com/kb/HT4517. Once you activate the iPad's hot spot feature, your laptop can connect to the iPad over Wi-Fi, a Bluetooth connection or by USB cable -- and use the tablet's Internet connection to go online. TIP OF THE WEEK Unless you have one of those cherished unlimited data plans for your smartphone or tablet, you may find yourself running out of megabytes before the end of your billing period. Plenty of third-party apps for monitoring data use exist, but you may also be able to use free tools built into your device's operating system to see how much of your monthly allowance you have burned through at any given time. In recent versions of Android, open the Settings icon from the All Apps screen and in the Wireless & Networks area, tap \"Data usage.'' Here, you can see how much data each app has used, set restrictions, set an overall limit and have Android display a warning when you get too close to it. In recent versions of the Windows Phone system, the Data Sense app in the App List can be used to monitor data use and set limits. In Apple devices running iOS 7, open the Settings icon on the Home screen and tap Cellular (or Cellular Data on an iPad) to see your current use amounts and choose which apps can, and cannot, use your cellular connection for downloading data.

        "content": " Amazon   issued a statement late Tuesday defending its right to discourage customers from buying books from Hachette, one of the country\u2019s biggest publishers. The online retailer, perhaps unnerved by the way it is being denounced all over the Internet, said the dispute was blown out of proportion, misunderstood and likely to last quite a while. \u201cWe are not optimistic that this will be resolved soon,\u201d  the statement said. If people really want a new book by James Patterson or another Hachette author, Amazon suggested going to \u201cone of our competitors:\u201d  Barnes & Noble   , presumably, or an independent store. A Hachette spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Amazon  has been telling customers   it will take as long as a month to ship books published by Hachette. The retailer is trying to influence the publisher to give it better terms on e-books. The statement is remarkable in several ways. Amazon almost always declines to explain itself, and this defense, published in one of its forums, goes on at length. Also extraordinary is the way Amazon, which has built its reputation on getting a huge variety of material to customers extremely quickly, made a point of saying it was making an exception in Hachette\u2019s case. \u201cIf you do need one of the affected titles quickly, we regret the inconvenience,\u201d the statement said. Amazon said the dispute was all about the customers. \u201cWhen we negotiate with suppliers, we are doing so on behalf of customers,\u201d it said. \u201cNegotiating for acceptable terms is an essential business practice that is critical to keeping service and value high for customers in the medium and long term.\u201d",

        "content": " Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook are so good at what they do, it is hard for even a mildly wired person to contemplate life without them. They answer our needs almost before we can express them, which means they ceaselessly extend their domination of our minds and wallets. News that reflects poorly on these companies tends to do little permanent damage, whether it is privacy issues, bullying behavior or poor treatment of workers. People care, in theory, but it is not in front of them the way the product or service itself is. Working in an Amazon warehouse might seem pretty miserable, in other words, but all a customer sees is that something ordered on Monday shows up on the doorstep on Wednesday. It\u2019s like magic. Even if customers care a lot, protesting can be difficult. On the Amazon \u2018\u2018Help and Customer Service\u2019\u2019 page, for example, there are all sorts of prominent instructions about how to return items or track packages, but none are about giving feedback to Amazon itself. This was the situation that confronted Ardelle Cowie when she heard that Amazon had begun delaying delivery of books from the publisher Hachette to its customers by as much as a month. Amazon was apparently trying to squeeze Hachette for better terms by causing trouble for readers and authors. \u2018\u2018I am a big fan of Amazon and spend as much as $5,000 per year there (not just books),\u2019\u2019 Ms. Cowie, a Connecticut investor and landlord, wrote me. \u2018\u2018But this treatment of Hachette is completely unacceptable. I called Amazon today to let them know that I will boycott them until this Hachette dispute is resolved.\u2019\u2019 The call did not go well. Ms. Cowie said she was unable to convince the help-desk person that she did not have a complaint about a delivery but had a complaint about Amazon itself. She contemplated a bolder course of action. Instead, Ms. Cowie, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister who instilled early a sense of right and wrong, just quit Amazon, or tried to. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m feeling a bit like I decided to go on a hunger strike but did so in the privacy of my own home without letting anybody know,\u2019\u2019 she wrote a week later. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve certainly missed Amazon. I bought three bird-watching books from Barnes & Noble about a week ago. So far, I\u2019ve received one.\u2019\u2019 Ms. Cowie had other problems. Amazon had the clothing hangers she wanted, but no one else did. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m convinced that Amazon will not make any effort to regain me since they can rely on getting me back due to the magnetism of their efficiency and their massive stock of everything,\u2019\u2019 she wrote. \u2018\u2018So, feeling as isolated as I do in my feeble protest, I believe I\u2019ll call it quits soon if there is no prospect of it making a difference to anyone.\u2019\u2019 This sort of experience could be why Amazon, which declined to comment, might think it will get what it wants from Hachette. On Friday, however, Ms. Cowie\u2019s resolve stiffened with the news that Amazon had escalated its campaign against Hachette. She signed up for another bookseller\u2019s express shipping plan. \u2018\u2018I am actually not missing Amazon right now,\u2019\u2019 she said.",

        "content": " BERLIN -- It was German authors, carefully monitoring their Amazon rankings, who were among the first to notice something was amiss. In a country where efficiency is prized as highly as the written word, Amazon was suddenly saying it could take as many as 11 days to deliver some older titles -- inconceivable given that a system of distributors ensuring deliveries within 24 hours has existed for decades, predating online book sales. Only when the German division of the Bonnier Media Group wrote to its authors and agents several weeks ago to apologize for the delays did an explanation emerge. Bonnier, one of Germany's largest publishing groups, said it was in negotiations with Amazon over how to share the earnings of its electronic books. The delays appeared to be a tactic aimed at forcing the publisher to give Amazon, the American retailing giant that has come to dominate book sales, a bigger cut of the proceeds. Like their counterparts in the United States who have felt the force of Amazon's clout, German book agents are chafing. ''This is above all about the future market and the e-book market,'' said Matthias Landwehr, a literary agent who represents many of the authors affected. So far, unlike in the United States, where Amazon has been discouraging customers from buying new and coming titles from Hachette by making it impossible to order or pre-order, the tactics in Germany involve only delays in deliveries of backlist titles of authors published by houses owned by the Bonnier Media Group. But in Europe, where the clout of American Internet giants is already deeply resented, whether on privacy grounds in the case of Google, or by their sheer marketing might, Amazon may find itself facing rules and resistance of sorts it has not encountered in the United States. Other European countries like France and Britain do not appear to be affected so far by Amazon's actions. Sales of Hachette's books via Amazon's site in France did not appear to be impeded; Hachette's French division declined to comment. Nor have other leading German publishers been targets. Still, many in the publishing world here contend that Amazon has used the negotiations with the German Bonnier imprints, which include Piper, Ullstein, Carlsen and Berlin Verlag, to send a message. ''They are using them to set an example and counting on the fact that publishers are not allowed to speak with one another,'' Mr. Landwehr said of Amazon, citing potential antitrust concerns on the publishers' part if they should compare notes. ''But if they can get them to change the existing conditions with one publisher, it would trigger a domino effect.'' Amazon did not respond to requests seeking comment. Amazon is no stranger to conflict in Europe. This year, French lawmakers approved what has become known informally as the ''anti-Amazon law,'' which restricts online vendors from offering free delivery on top of the country's maximum 5 percent discount on books. In Germany, the company came under fire last year for its use of immigrant workers and Amazon workers in two of the largest distribution plants have been struggling to unionize. But the new dispute marks the first time the American company has confronted head-on the country's tradition of protecting the printed word. Germany has prided itself since the 19th century on being the home of ''Dichter und Denker,'' or poets and philosophers. As in several other European countries, including France, Austria and Italy, books in Germany are considered of such indispensable value to society that publishers are allowed to dictate the prices at which retailers can sell all new titles, including best sellers and e-books. That law also is aimed at ensuring the survival of a thriving network of bookshops. The German Publishers and Booksellers Association counts 3,800 across this country of 80.7 million people, from larger chain stores to traditional antique booksellers. Yet in a country where shopping hours are also tightly controlled by the government, Germans are becoming increasingly accustomed to the ease and independence of ordering books at all hours and having them delivered to their front doors. Germany's book-order business, including online sales, grew by 4 percent last year to 2.7 billion euros, or $3.7 billion, according to the Federation of Mail-Order Booksellers. Amazon towered above its competitors, controlling more than half of the German market, with sales of \u20ac1.9 billion. Amazon has an even stronger hold on the e-book market here, despite attempts by German publishers to create an alternative open-source platform to compete with the Amazon Kindle format. E-book sales in Germany grew 200 percent from 2012 to 2013, and experts predict that number will only increase. But given German price-setting laws, Amazon has little wiggle room in Germany for increasing its share of the income generated by e-books. While Amazon receives a 50-50 percent cut of all printed books sold in Germany, the standard rate for e-books gives the company just 30 percent of the sales price, with the remainder going to the publisher, who then pays authors. Amazon appears to be banking on the strength of its position to push for a larger share of the proceeds, hoping to eventually reach the parity it enjoys on printed books, said Christian Russ, an attorney who specializes in publishing law. ''The publishers are not allowed to react under the current antitrust laws,'' he said. ''Every individual publisher is forced to deal with these demands, because they cannot break with a company that accounts for 50 percent of the market.'' The German booksellers association has responded by calling on lawmakers to adapt antitrust laws to better fit the digital market, which would allow publishers to band together. It is also pushing lawmakers to grant e-books the same value-added-tax exemptions that printed books receive. The tax now on e-books is 19 percent, compared with 7 percent for printed books, which further reduces the wiggle room for price negotiations. The European Commission has ruled against allowing member states to lower their V.A.T. rates on e-books, although both France and Luxembourg, where digital copies of books are taxed at 7 percent and 3 percent, respectively, have ignored that edict. The commission on Monday had no comment on the Bonnier publishers' dispute with Amazon, a spokeswoman said. Mr. Landwehr, the literary agent, contends that ultimately Amazon wants to drive authors away from the traditional system of agents and publishers, and have them sign directly with the company's Kindle Direct Publishing. He said he counsels authors against such arrangements, pointing to what he considers the heavy-handed tactics the company is using against Bonnier. Public reaction by German authors has been generally muted, although many have reached out to their publishers asking how they can show their support, Siv Bublitz, chief executive of the Ullstein publishing, wrote in an email. ''We have asked them to show restraint at the moment, because we are in talks with Amazon and do not want to exacerbate the conflict from our side,'' Ms. Bublitz said. Joscha Sauer, a cartoonist whose works are published by Carlsen, is one of the few who swiftly took to social media to decry Amazon for ''blackmailing several publishers.'' He said that he has ''no clue'' whether sales of his backlisted books have been affected. ''It is theoretically possible that through the dispute, even more people have become aware of my work,'' Mr. Sauer said in a telephone interview from Frankfurt. ''From a purely moral standpoint, what Amazon is doing is a dirty trick. From an economic point of view, it is nothing out of the ordinary.''",

        "content": " Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook are so good at what they do, it's hard for even a mildly wired person to contemplate life without them. They answer our needs almost before we can express them, which means they ceaselessly extend their domination of our minds and wallets. News that reflects poorly on these companies tends to do little permanent damage, whether it is privacy issues, bullying behavior or poor treatment of workers. People care, in theory, but it's not in front of them the way the product or service itself is. Working in an Amazon warehouse might seem pretty miserable, in other words, but all customers see is that the thing they ordered on Monday shows up on their doorstep on Wednesday. It's like magic. Even if customers care a lot, protesting can be difficult. On the Amazon ''Help and Customer Service'' page, for example, there are all sorts of prominent instructions about how to return items or track packages, but none are about giving feedback to Amazon itself. (The answer, dogged investigative reporting reveals, lies in the ''Contact Us'' button off to the side, which takes you through another series of prompts that says you want to talk about ''something else.'') This was the situation that confronted Ardelle Cowie when she heard that Amazon had begun delaying delivery of books from Hachette to its customers by as much as a month. Amazon was apparently trying to squeeze Hachette for better terms by causing trouble for its readers and authors. More than a few people were bothered by this, at least if Twitter is something to go by, but Ms. Cowie seemed more bothered than most. ''I am a big fan of Amazon and spend as much as $5,000 per year there (not just books),'' Ms. Cowie, a Connecticut investor and landlord, wrote me. ''But this treatment of Hachette is completely unacceptable. I called Amazon today to let them know that I will boycott them until this Hachette dispute is resolved.'' The call did not go well. Ms. Cowie said she was unable to persuade the help-desk person that she did not have a complaint about a delivery but had a complaint about Amazon itself. ''Maybe some tweeting would help, but I'm 68 and don't know how to manage that,'' she told me. She contemplated a bolder course of action. ''It occurred to me,'' she wrote me in another message, ''that I might put things on my wish list but NOT buy them from Amazon.'' Instead, she would buy them elsewhere and let Amazon know that, so the retailer could quantify how much it was losing. ''Is that too complicated for them to understand?'' Yes, she concluded. Instead, Ms. Cowie, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister who instilled early a sense of right and wrong, just quit Amazon. Or tried to. ''I'm feeling a bit like I decided to go on a hunger strike but did so in the privacy of my own home without letting anybody know,'' she wrote a week later. ''I've certainly missed Amazon. I bought three bird-watching books from Barnes & Noble about a week ago. So far, I've received one. I need to consult Amazon to make decisions about what I want to order because the customer feedback is so weak at B.&N.'' There were other problems. Amazon had the clothing hangers she wanted, but no one else did. ''I'm convinced that Amazon will not make any effort to regain me since they can rely on getting me back due to the magnetism of their efficiency and their massive stock of everything,'' she wrote. ''So, feeling as isolated as I do in my feeble protest, I believe I'll call it quits soon if there is no prospect of it making a difference to anyone.'' Now you know why Amazon expects to win its battle with Hachette, and indeed every battle with its suppliers. A spokesman for the retailer declined to comment. On Friday, however, with the news that Amazon was escalating its case against the publisher, her resolve was once again stiffening. Her books, she said, would henceforth be purchased elsewhere. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. Ardelle Cowie, who says she spends as much as $5,000 a year on Amazon, is protesting Amazon's treatment of Hachette.

        "name": "Q. and A.: Chan Koonchung on Tibet, Sex and Censorship ",
        "content": " The shopkeeper at the small Hong Kong bookstore recognized the author Chan Koonchung right away. The  People\u2019s Recreation Community   \u2014 its initials are a play on People\u2019s Republic of China \u2014 specializes in books that are banned on the Chinese mainland, but not in the relatively free territory of Hong Kong. Mr. Chan found his own volumes on the shelf across from the cashier, while the shopkeeper brought over mugs of milk tea. Mr. Chan, 61, a Shanghai native who grew up in Hong Kong and now lives in Beijing,  caught international   attention   with \u201cThe Fat Years,\u201d his 2009 sci-fi novel in which a month disappears from the historical record \u2014 but citizens never notice because they have been brainwashed into being blindly happy. Predictably, given the book\u2019s not-so-subtle allusion to the cover-up of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, it has never been published on the mainland. His latest novel, \u201cThe Unbearable Dreamworld of Champa the Driver,\u201d about a young Tibetan trying to find his way in Beijing, was published in English this month. In an interview, Mr. Chan talked about sex, censorship, Tibet, stolen pets and people opening his mail. Excerpts follow: Q. Did you try getting \u201cThe Fat Years\u201d published on the mainland? A. Several mainland publishers came to me after the novel got published. I asked them to read it first before we talked. They didn\u2019t come back. But someone \u2014 I don\u2019t know who \u2014 typed it up in simplified Chinese and passed it around the Internet, where it stayed for about six months. There were at least two versions \u2014 one typed and one scanned \u2014 that were widely circulated, mostly as PDFs, until they were deleted. The censors were not so fast back then. Q. Did a similar thing happen to \u201cChampa\u201d? A. This time, the controls are tighter. They are getting better at blocking things. And maybe readers are less keen. There are so many titles in China now. Why would people want to spend their energy looking for the censored ones? Q. Where do you get your own reading materials? A. There are one or two really good bookstores in Beijing, plus Amazon China. For English books, I can go to the U.S. Amazon.com and they get through most of the time. But banned books are a problem. I tried to get my own books \u2014 meaning books I had written \u2014 sent to me, and they were not allowed in. They are opening my boxes. Q. What are you reading? A. I\u2019m trying to finish these thick novels by Jonathan Franzen \u2014 \u201cThe Corrections\u201d and \u201cFreedom.\u201d I\u2019ve also read \u201c2666\u201d by Roberto Bola\u00f1o. I\u2019m not courageous enough to write such thick novels for Chinese audiences. And I read \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d by Zadie Smith. I liked that. Q. \u201cChampa\u201d begins with an affair between a handsome young Tibetan and an older, richer businesswoman. She is the sugar mommy and he is the arm candy. Why did you turn this gender stereotype on its head? A. This is something I noticed in real life. Many Chinese women in middle age, when they go to Tibet their behavior changes. They become very flirty with their tour guide or driver \u2014 and they\u2019d never do that in Beijing. And these guys are quite handsome. The protagonist is a Tibetan young man. He is intelligent, but not highly literate. He likes his women, his wine and his cars. I tried to write it as directly as possible. He isn\u2019t deep. He\u2019s deeply flawed. Q. How does the Tibet you depict differ from the usual stereotypes? A. My ambition was to write an antiromantic novel about Tibet. I didn\u2019t want to write about this Shangri-La-type place that was spiritual and exotic. I\u2019ve been to Tibet many times. Lhasa is very modern. Half the population is not Tibetan, and many Tibetans work for the state \u2014 for example, as police. These young people behave just like other Chinese, with their fake designer jeans and obsession with cars. These guys \u2014 they do love their vehicles. So I wanted someone who was not a herder or a farmer. Q. How much has Tibet changed in one generation? A. I started researching Tibet because I was supposed to be producing a movie for Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s studio. I started visiting Tibet in 1992, and it has changed a lot. There are more Chinese than ever from the mainland. The number of Chinese tourists has broken all records, but there are fewer international tourists because it is hard for them to get visas. Sometimes they will let elderly Westerners in in small groups, but the young backpackers are largely gone. The same with foreign NGOs. There are very few left in Tibet. Q. There are two graphic scenes in which Champa seems to force himself on women, including both this businesswoman and her daughter. Would you call this rape? A. In one case, you have a young girl who is quite unsure of her sexuality, and a young man who did not enjoy doing it. It is really a gray area. While both women did not like it, they did not resist much, either. I wanted to create sexual relationships that were as complex as possible. It\u2019s a metaphor for Chinese and Tibetan relationships. Tibet and China are engaged in a very complex co-dependency. You should feel uncomfortable reading these passages. Q. With his Tibetan looks and Tibetan papers, Champa has a hard time finding a place to stay. Would you say that the Chinese were being racist to him? A. They\u2019re pragmatic. The hotels want to avoid trouble, and so they overreact. Landlords, too. And the result is not so subtle. Q. The only job Champa can get in Beijing is \u201csecurity work in a hotel,\u201d which is a euphemism for \u201cthug in a black jail\u201d \u2014 an extralegal detention center. How common is this practice? A. The one thing a Tibetan guy can do in Beijing is be a security guard. In fact, Beijing has held recruiting campaigns for young Lhasa men to do this work in the capital. So Champa goes to work for one of these \u201chotels.\u201d When the government rounds up petitioners, they are kept in these \u201chotels\u201d until they can be sent back to their home provinces. There are also \u201chotels\u201d that the local security officials use for people when they don\u2019t want to press official charges. It\u2019s a non-place. Q. Champa gets involved with activists trying to save a truckload of dogs headed for the slaughterhouse. Does this really happen? A. Eating dog is legal in China, and the dog meat restaurants need supplies. But nobody actually rears meat dogs \u2014 it\u2019s too expensive \u2014 so they just steal them. These incidents really take place. A group of activists will stop a delivery truck with their cars \u2014 they have cars because they are generally middle-class. Then they buy up the stock of stolen dogs. I find it encouraging that people are organizing things not related to their immediate interests. Q. You\u2019ve worked with Greenpeace and local environmental groups. You also predict a dark ecological future in your novels. How bad is the situation in China? Is the damage reversible? A. Some rivers could still be cleaned up \u2014 some, maybe not all. The air quality could be improved if they made an effort to phase out coal. Forestry is almost gone. That\u2019s too late. You can\u2019t replant biodiversity. But the main problem is the underground water \u2014 it\u2019s so polluted. This is the most serious crisis: the water supply.",

        "content": " Amazon's power over the publishing and bookselling industries is unrivaled in the modern era. Now it has started wielding its might in a more brazen way than ever before. Seeking ever-higher payments from publishers to bolster its anemic bottom line, Amazon is holding books and authors hostage on two continents by delaying shipments and raising prices. The literary community is fearful and outraged -- and practically begging for government intervention. ''How is this not extortion? You know, the thing that is illegal when the Mafia does it,'' asked Dennis Loy Johnson of Melville House, echoing remarks being made across social media. Amazon is, as usual, staying mum. ''We talk when we have something to say,'' Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder and chief executive, said at the company's annual meeting this week. The battle is being waged largely over physical books. In the United States, Amazon has been discouraging customers from buying titles from Hachette, the fourth-largest publisher by market share. Late Thursday, it escalated the dispute by making it impossible to order Hachette titles being issued this summer and fall. It is using some of the same tactics against the Bonnier Media Group in Germany. But the real prize is control of e-books, the future of publishing. Publishers tried to rein in Amazon once, and got slapped with a federal antitrust suit for their efforts. Amazon was not directly a party to the case but has reaped the rewards in increased market power. Now it wants to increase its share of the digital proceeds. The publishers, weighing a slide into irrelevance if not nonexistence, are trying to hold the line. Late Friday afternoon, Hachette made by far its strongest comment on the conflict. ''We are determined to protect the value of our authors' books and our own work in editing, distributing and marketing them,'' said Sophie Cottrell, a Hachette senior vice president. ''We hope this difficult situation will not last a long time, but we are sparing no effort and exploring all options.'' The Authors Guild accused the retailer of acting illegally. ''Amazon clearly has substantial market power and is abusing that market power to maintain and increase its dominance, which likely violates Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act,'' said Jan Constantine, the Guild's general counsel. Independent booksellers, meanwhile, announced they could supply Hachette books immediately. The second-largest physical chain, Books-a-Million, advertised 30 percent discounts on select coming Hachette titles. Among the publisher's imprints are Grand Central Publishing, Orbit and Little, Brown. Amazon is also flexing its muscles in Germany, delaying deliveries of books from Bonnier. ''It appears that Amazon is doing exactly that on the German market which it has been doing on the U.S. market: using its dominant position in the market to blackmail the publishers,'' said Alexander Skipis, president of the German Publishers and Booksellers Association. The association said its antitrust experts were examining whether Amazon's tactics violated the law. ''Of course it is very comfortable for customers to be able to order over the Internet, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,'' Mr. Skipis said. ''But with such an online structure as pursued by Amazon, a book market is being destroyed that has been nurtured over decades and centuries.'' Christian Schumacher-Gebler, chief executive for Bonnier in Germany, said the group's leading publishing houses noticed delays in deliveries of some of its books several weeks ago and confronted the retailer. ''Amazon confirmed to us that these delays are directly related to the ongoing negotiations over conditions in the electronic book market,'' Mr. Schumacher-Gebler said. The retailer began refusing orders late Thursday for coming Hachette books, including J. K. Rowling's new novel, published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. In some cases, even the web pages promoting the books have disappeared. Anne Rivers Siddons's new novel, ''The Girls of August,'' coming in July, no longer has a page for the physical book or even the Kindle edition. Only the audio edition is still being sold (for more than $30). The confrontations with the publishers are the biggest display of Amazon's dominance since it briefly stripped another publisher, Macmillan, of its ''buy'' buttons in 2010. It seems likely to encourage debate about the concentration of power by the retailer. No firm in American history has exerted the control over the American book market -- physical, digital and secondhand -- that Amazon does. James Patterson, one of the country's best-selling writers, described the confrontation between Amazon and Hachette as ''a war.'' ''Bookstores, libraries, authors, and books themselves are caught in the crossfire of an economic war,'' he wrote on Facebook. ''If this is the new American way, then maybe it has to be changed -- by law, if necessary -- immediately, if not sooner.'' Mr. Patterson's novels due to be released this summer and fall are now impossible to buy from Amazon in either print or digital form. Hachette, which is owned by the French conglomerate Lagard\u00e8re, was one of the publishers in the antitrust case, which involved e-book prices. But even before that, relations between the retailer and the publisher have been tense. Hachette made the case to Washington regulators in 2009 that Amazon was having a detrimental effect on publishing, but got nowhere. For several months, Amazon has been quietly discouraging the sales of Hachette's physical books by several techniques -- cutting the customer's discount so the book approached list price, taking weeks to ship the book, suggesting that prospective customers buy other books instead and increasing the discount for the Kindle version. Amazon has millions of members in its Prime club, who get fast shipping. This was, as Internet wits quickly called it, the ''UnPrime'' approach. The retailer's strategy seems to be to drive a wedge between the writers, who need Amazon sales to survive, and Hachette. But this does not seem to be working the way Amazon might want. Nina Laden, a children's book writer, was one of many Hachette authors lashing out at Amazon in the last week. ''I have supported Amazon for as long as Amazon has existed,'' she wrote in a Facebook posting she also sent to the retailer. She went on to say that she was ''frankly shocked and angry at what you are doing'' to her new book, ''Once Upon a Memory.'' ''It has made me tell my readers to shop elsewhere -- and they are and will,'' she wrote. (Amazon customer service wrote back, saying ''We will be glad to investigate this issue further'' if Ms. Laden would provide additional information.) One of the books made scarce by Amazon's actions is an updated edition of Brad Stone's ''The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon.'' The book revealed how Mr. Bezos said Amazon should approach vulnerable publishers ''the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.'' ''What irony,'' said Mr. Stone, a former reporter for The New York Times. ''A book detailing Amazon's heavy-handed tactics in business negotiations becomes, at least in a small way, a victim of those tactics.''",

        "content": " The biggest test yet of American investors\u2019 appetite for a Chinese Internet company has passed with flying colors \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t involve the Alibaba Group, China\u2019s e-commerce giant. Instead, JD.com, an online retailer aspiring to become China\u2019s answer to Amazon.com, exceeded expectations for its initial public offering on Wednesday, raising $1.78 billion. Even though the company has lost money for the last several years, the stock sale valued the company at $25.7 billion, a valuation even higher than Twitter\u2019s at its market debut last fall. The warm reception for JD.com reflects investor hunger for a wave of fast-growing Chinese companies that are going public in the United States to stake their claims as global technology powers. The biggest of these budding titans remains Alibaba, something of an amalgam of eBay, Amazon and Google, whose astounding growth has inflated expectations for its coming I.P.O. Analysts have speculated that Alibaba may be worth as much as $200 billion when it finally goes public, more than the value of Facebook or Amazon. These Chinese companies have drawn intense interest because they offer shareholders a way to tap China\u2019s enormous growth. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re basically directional bets on the Chinese consumer economy,\u2019\u2019 said Rett Wallace, the chief executive and a co-founder of Triton Research. JD.com, however, is coming to market at a time when the once-torrid pace of technology I.P.O.s has slowed significantly amid concerns over high valuations. Some once-hot stocks, like the security firm FireEye, are trading below their offering prices. But the allure of a fast-growing Chinese Internet company appears to have proved powerful: The offer was 15 times oversubscribed, according to a person briefed on the matter. Shares in JD.com rose sharply after they began trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday, and were up 10.2 percent at $20.94 near midday. By many measures, JD.com is not nearly as big as Alibaba, whether by revenue or market value. But the retailer, whose backers include the Chinese mobile software giant Tencent, has established itself as a significant force in its home market on the back of its expansive online shopping empire. JD.com, which began as a seller of electronics, now claims to be the biggest direct seller to Chinese consumers, with $20.7 billion worth of goods sold to customers last year. Much of the company\u2019s appeal lies in the relatively unconquered Chinese e-commerce market. In its prospectus, JD.com noted that less than 50 percent of the country\u2019s population was online. And online shopping is expected to grow about 27 percent each year, according to the iResearch Consulting Group. Though many investors have directly compared JD.com to Alibaba, the two operate differently. JD.com maintains a significant amount of product inventory and owns much of its shipping and logistics network, a business model that many have likened to Amazon\u2019s core business. But Alibaba serves primarily as a middleman between customers and sellers, akin to parts of eBay and Amazon. Alibaba\u2019s is a much less expensive operating model that gives the company its eye-popping margins: Operating profits in the first nine months of its 2013 fiscal year amounted to 48 percent of revenue, a ratio that is the envy of Silicon Valley giants. By contrast, JD.com has reported a loss for each of the last five years, even as its sales have ballooned. Last year, for instance, the company lost $8 million, despite racking up $11.5 billion in sales. The company has reinvested significantly in its operations, following Amazon\u2019s example and betting that investors will give it the same sort of leeway that they allow the American retailer. Among its biggest costs has been investing in a delivery network that offers same-day delivery in 43 Chinese cities. Running such an operation is likely to be costly over time, though the company has argued that it reaps other benefits from that spending. \u2018\u2018It really has been able to control the customer experience,\u2019\u2019 said Kelland Willis, an analyst at Forrester Research. JD.com also benefits from its association with Tencent, an Internet software company often considered the biggest rival to Alibaba. Tencent purchased a 15 percent stake in JD.com this spring, and it formally acquired an additional 5 percent on Wednesday in a transaction tied to the I.P.O. The tie-up had benefits for both sides. JD.com took over much of Tencent\u2019s e-commerce operations. It also gained access to something that may be even more valuable down the road: WeChat, the enormously popular messaging service that Tencent runs, which claims about 400 million monthly active users. Already, about 18 percent of JD.com\u2019s orders come via mobile devices. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re integrated into the biggest messaging app in China,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Willis said. \u2018\u2018It does give them an advantage.\u2019\u2019 JD.com\u2019s offering also will bestow wealth \u2014 both realized and on paper \u2014 on its existing investors. The biggest is the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, Richard Qiangdong Liu, who will sell shares in the I.P.O. but will still control billions of dollars\u2019 worth of its stock. Other big winners are Western investors including Tiger Global Management, an investment firm, and DST Global, the Russian investment group. Both are also expected to keep multibillion-dollar stakes. While those investors will benefit from the eagerness of newcomers, analysts have raised concerns about parts of JD.com\u2019s structure, among them the unusual power the company\u2019s founder will have. Thanks to his ownership of a second, much more powerful class of stock, Mr. Liu will continue to exert an enormous amount of control, wielding an effective 84 percent of the retailer\u2019s voting power. And analysts have questioned whether JD.com will be able to build itself into a colossus like Amazon. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s so much suspension of belief by Americans investing in these companies,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Wallace of Triton said. Still, he added, \u2018\u2018This is just one of a handful of companies that have some scale and staying power in that market.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "Amazon\u2019s Tactics Confirm Its Critics\u2019 Worst Suspicions ",
        "content": " Amazon   is confirming its critics\u2019 worst fears and it is an ugly spectacle to behold. For years, authors and publishers have warned that Amazon,  Jeff Bezos \u2019 book-selling giant, would one day use its power for ill. Sure, so far, Amazon has marketed itself as a book buyer\u2019s best friend. It sells books at terrifically low prices, it delivers them amazingly quickly, and it constantly invents new technologies to improve the way we read. Amazon has also invested heavily in publishing new authors and it has pushed exciting new formats made possible by electronic distribution. Yet the literary community has always greeted Amazon\u2019s moves with suspicion. The fear is mostly about the future. What will happen to books when Amazon controls the entire industry? How will authors and publishing houses reckon with Amazon\u2019s unchecked power? This week, as part of a contract dispute with the publisher Hachette,  we\u2019re seeing Amazon behaving at its worst . The company\u2019s willingness to nakedly flex its anticompetitive muscle gives new cause for concern to anyone who cares about books \u2014 authors, publishers, but mainly customers. Here\u2019s the back story: In an effort to exert pressure on Hachette, Amazon began taking down preorder buttons for many Hachette titles. It has also suddenly raised prices on some Hachette books and has changed its page design to more prominently recommend other titles. These moves follow weeks of increasingly hardball tactics. Among other customer-punishing moves, Amazon has increased shipping times for Hachette titles from a few days to weeks. For years, Amazon\u2019s drive for cheaper prices has been good for consumers, and  arguably for literary culture , too. When books are cheaper and more widely accessible, more people can read them \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing better for literary culture than people owning and reading books. Physical bookstores sell books at a huge markup, which necessarily reduces the number of books that people can afford to buy. Amazon sells printed books, e-books and audiobooks for much, much less. Anyone who has used Amazon\u2019s services has noticed how that fact changes one\u2019s attitude toward books. Through its Prime program, through the Kindle, and through its audiobook subsidiary Audible, Amazon has made it possible to buy books on impulse. Just wait, the company\u2019s critics have always shot back. Wait till Amazon controls the whole market \u2014 then see how well it treats authors, publishers and customers. Now Amazon is walking right into its detractors\u2019 predictions. There are a couple obvious reasons this is a bad strategy. It\u2019s bad public relations \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t already, Amazon may soon control a monopolistic stake of the e-book market and its tactics are sure to invite not only scorn from the book industry but also increased regulatory oversight. But the more basic problem here is that Amazon is violating its own code. To win a corporate battle, Amazon is ruining its customer experience. Mr. Bezos has long pointed to customer satisfaction as his North Star; making sure customers are treated well is the guiding principle for how he runs Amazon. Now Amazon is raising prices, removing ordering buttons, lengthening shipping times and monkeying with recommendation algorithms. Do these sound like the moves of a man who cares about customers above all else?",

        "content": " JD.COM STARTS HOT | The online Chinese retailer JD.com started life as a publicly traded company with a rousing start, closing up 10 percent on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Thursday,  DealBook\u2019s Michael J. de la   Merced writes . At that price, shareholders valued the company at more than $28.6 billion, more than other United States technology names like Twitter and LinkedIn. Shares of the retailer closed at $20.90 for each American depositary receipt. The company\u2019s successful debut was encouraging for the biggest Chinese technology firm, the e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba Group, which acts as eBay, Amazon.com and Google wrapped into one. Alibaba filed to go public in the United States earlier this month, though it has not yet publicly provided details about how much it will raise and where it will list. What\u2019s more, JD.com achieved a rich price  despite poor governance , another good sign for Alibaba, which is also hoping to sell an unusual governance structure to investors in its own I.P.O. Compared with Alibaba, JD.com is smaller by revenue and valuation. Like Amazon, JD.com says that it is most focused on its customers\u2019 experience and has poured its profits into reinvestments in operations, particularly its delivery services. As a result, the Chinese company has reported net losses for the last five years. CREDIT SUISSE\u2019S UNLIKELY FOE | \u201cHundreds of miles from Credit Suisse\u2019s Madison Avenue office tower and an ocean away from its headquarters in Zurich, the bank found an unlikely opponent in Alexandria, Va.,\u201d  DealBook\u2019s Ben Protess writes . There, federal prosecutors helped lead an investigation into the Swiss bank, which this week pleaded guilty to helping thousands of United States clients hide their wealth overseas. Never mind that Credit Suisse has no offices in Virginia, Mr. Protess writes, adding, \u201cProsecutors at the United States attorney\u2019s office in Alexandria, working with the Justice Department\u2019s tax division in Washington, had all the jurisdiction they wanted: A lone Credit Suisse client, on a single day eight years ago, flew out of Dulles International Airport in Virginia on his way to Zurich.\u201d The tactic demonstrated the long arm of prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia, who have prosecuted a number of banks and other financial players scattered across the country and the globe. Under Neil H. MacBride, who led the attorney\u2019s office until recently, Virginia prosecutors filed some of the few criminal cases stemming from the 2008 financial crisis, though against regional companies rather than big Wall Street players. Headline-grabbing financial cases typically belong to Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, but prosecutors in Virginia have a few tactical advantages. For one, the office ranks as the quickest federal court district in the country in terms of the time it takes for a case to go to trial. BARCLAYS FINED | Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority has fined Barclays $43.9 million after it accused a former trader at the British lender of improperly influencing gold prices at the expense of a customer,  DealBook\u2019s   Chad Bray writes . The regulator said it issued the fine because Barclays failed to adequately manage conflicts of interest between the bank and its customers and for a failure in its internal controls. The failures occurred from 2004 to 2013. The F.C.A. also fined Daniel James Plunkett, a former Barclays trader, 95,600 pounds and barred him from participating in any regulated financial activity. The F.C.A. said Mr. Plunkett, who settled with the regulator, profited at the expense of a customer. Mr. Plunkett\u2019s improper conduct occurred a day after the F.C.A. and the United States authorities announced a $450 million fine against Barclays for improperly influencing global benchmark interest rates, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The Barclays fine comes as the F.C.A. has been examining whether the gold fixing process complies with new international standards put in place for benchmarks in light of the Libor scandal. The fine is the latest black eye for Barclays, which has struggled to rebuild its reputation since it became the first bank to admit to wrongdoing in the Libor scandal two years ago.

PATTON BOGGS MERGER HITS SNAG | The anticipated merger between two large legal firms was derailed, at least temporarily, on Thursday after one firm, Patton Boggs, faced a legal complication stemming from its involvement in a case over damage to the Amazon rain forest,  Elizabeth Olson writes in DealBook . A partnership vote had been set for this weekend to finalize the Patton Boggs merger with Squire Sanders, an international firm founded in Ohio. But the vote is said to have been suspended. The suspension came after a motion was filed on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan to block a settlement between Patton Boggs and the Chevron Corporation, Ms. Olson writes. The settlement required Patton Boggs to withdraw from representing clients in Ecuador who were seeking to collect a $9.5 billion verdict against Chevron that their principal lawyer, Steven R. Donziger, had won in an Ecuador court. As a result of the settlement, Patton Boggs forfeited millions in fees and paid Chevron $15 million. In legal papers, Mr. Donziger called Patton Boggs\u2019s actions \u201cunprecedented\u201d and a \u201cflagrant\u201d ethical violation. Patton Boggs agreed to the deal with Chevron to \u201cpave the way for a merger with another law firm,\u201d he wrote, which made the violations \u201call the more troubling.\u201d Patton Boggs has been seeking a merger partner for some months but has been haunted by its work for the Ecuadorean clients. | Contact:  @melbournecoal   |  E-mail Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter , delivered every morning and afternoon.

        "name": "Online Grocery Start-Up Takes Page From Sharing Services ",
        "content": " Correction Appended \u201cI hope you realize that you are about to witness a remarkable display in ineptitude,\u201d the technology investor Michael J. Moritz said as he entered a Whole Foods store in San Francisco one recent afternoon. Mr. Moritz, the chairman of the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and a recipient of a British knighthood last year, was wearing a bright green T-shirt bearing a logo for Instacart, a two-year-old grocery delivery start-up that Sequoia has invested in. He was here to show me what it\u2019s like to work for the start-up \u2014 in particular, how unexpectedly difficult it is to quickly and accurately buy and deliver an assortment of groceries for a stranger. Instacart   might not sound like a novel service. It is one of several companies that is trying to revive a dream first floated, and then shelved, during the last dot-com boom \u2014 the dream of ordering your staples online and having them show up at your door a short while later. At least a half-dozen firms offer grocery delivery across the country, including Amazon.com\u2019s AmazonFresh, FreshDirect, Peapod and services run by big grocery chains. But behind the scenes, Instacart is unusual and intriguing. It operates according to a decentralized business model that borrows from services like Uber, Airbnb and other firms in the  so-called sharing economy . And it is not only potentially lucrative, but also could redefine how we think about the future of labor. When you buy groceries from Instacart, the company summons a green-shirted \u201cpersonal shopper\u201d through the firm\u2019s smartphone app. The shopper receives your list, scurries through a grocery store to pick up your items and then heads across town in his own car to deliver your stuff. Instacart\u2019s shoppers earn from $15 to $30 an hour, depending on how quickly they deliver people\u2019s food. That\u2019s quite a high wage considering the job does not require a college degree, is part time and can be done during flexible hours. It\u2019s substantially more than the typical supermarket worker salary of about  $9 to $11 per hour   \u2014 though of course without any benefits like health insurance. The workers are independent contractors, responsible for paying for expenses like their own Social Security taxes. Still, Instacart\u2019s success suggests that rather than simply automate workers out of their jobs, technology might create new labor opportunities for people who haven\u2019t acquired formal credentials or skills in an economy where low- and medium-skilled workers face a bleak outlook. Like the ride-sharing service Uber, Instacart creates work by connecting affluent customers who have more money than time with part-time workers who have the opposite problem \u2014 lots of time, not enough money. But unlike ride-sharing or apartment rental services, Instacart isn\u2019t intruding upon a regulated industry, and its service poses little risk to its customers\u2019 health or property, so it faces few of  the complications that have dogged   other sharing companies . Because it expands the customer base for physical stores, it has also been welcomed by some grocery chains as a potential bulwark against the wider roll-out of Amazon\u2019s delivery service. \u201cWhen you ask what kind of niches we\u2019ll see for people who used to be in traditional middle-class jobs, this is the kind of labor that could fit into that,\u201d said Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University whose book \u201cAverage Is Over\u201d contemplates how technology is altering labor markets. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to suggest people will become grocery-delivery millionaires,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if you don\u2019t have a college education but you\u2019re smart and responsible, could you make a living doing this and maybe piecing it together with some of these other kinds of jobs? Absolutely.\u201d Instacart was founded in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, now 27, an engineer who spent two years working at Amazon.com. \u201cI had this problem of never having groceries in my fridge and never having the motivation and energy to go to the store,\u201d Mr. Mehta said. But he found most grocery services, including AmazonFresh, too cumbersome. They required him to submit his order many hours in advance of delivery, and they sometimes didn\u2019t offer the merchandise he was used to getting at his local store. What\u2019s more, traditional grocery delivery services are costly to set up, requiring warehouses to store perishable food, a fleet of custom-painted trucks for delivery and a staff of full- or part-time workers to package and deliver the orders. \u201cWe were the clowns who invested in WebVan, and we are only just getting out of therapy from that,\u201d Mr. Moritz said, referring to the first boom\u2019s spectacular grocery flameout. Instacart does not maintain warehouses or trucks. Instead, the service is assembled out of found parts \u2014 existing supermarkets, willing part-time workers and their cars. The model has many advantages. It creates vast selection for customers by allowing them to shop at many different stores, from large chains to specialty shops like San Francisco\u2019s worker-owned, vegan-friendly Rainbow Co-Op. It allows for extremely quick delivery too, including an option that will deliver your groceries in under an hour. Though he declined to provide specifics, Mr. Mehta also said the firm had turned a profit in certain markets. Instacart now operates in 10 cities, including New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Austin, Seattle and Los Angeles, and plans to be in 17 by the end of the year. It has 50 full-time employees and more than 1,000 independent shoppers under contract, many of whom fall into two demographic groups: college students and middle-aged mothers looking for flexible work. Despite its low-cost business model, Instacart isn\u2019t cheap. The service charges a delivery fee of $3.99 for most orders, and it also makes money by marking up store prices. The amounts vary depending on the item, but I noticed Instacart\u2019s prices coming in at about 20 percent more than I could find at my local store. The markup explains in part how Instacart can afford to pay shoppers such high wages. But as I discovered as I shopped with Mr. Moritz, there\u2019s another factor behind high pay: Shopping is a skill, and Instacart pays handsomely to get people who are very good at it. Though he could talk at length about the virtues of Instacart\u2019s business, Mr. Moritz is a billionaire investor, but he turned out to be a poor shopper. As we walked through Whole Foods, he often needed my help to locate a customer\u2019s items. I had to show him where to find grapes, bananas and Perrier; neither of us had any luck finding Babybel cheese. A few days later, I went on another delivery with Sharon Schedler, a 43-year-old mother who has been working for Instacart for about a year. She was a pro. Despite my peppering her with questions, she completed an 11-item order in under 10 minutes, including giving the customer a call to suggest substituting chicken breasts for chicken tenders, which were out of stock. Ms. Schedler was also meticulous about picking produce. \u201cI try to be pickier than I would be for myself,\u201d she said as she studied zucchinis for nicks. Lawrence F. Katz, an economist at Harvard who studies technology and labor, offered a few reasons to stifle excessive optimism about Instacart\u2019s model. First, technology may yet one day render Instacart\u2019s shoppers obsolete. Drones could pick our groceries, after all. Another possibility, he said, is that wages will be bid down as more people compete to become Instacart shoppers. Or, as the company\u2019s software becomes more sophisticated, it could squeeze more efficiency out of workers; they may end up doing more work and not earn any more money for it. A third problem is the lack of job security and benefits, which were once considered standard features of middle-class jobs. But Mr. Mehta says he doesn\u2019t see that shifting. \u201cThe advantage to this model is that you choose your own hours,\u201d he said.

        "name": "Amazon vs. Hachette: When Does Discouragement Become Misrepresentation? ",
        "content": " For months now, Amazon  has been trying to put the screws   on Hachette, the smallest of the Big Five publishers, by discouraging people from buying its printed books. Amazon\u2019s goal: force Hachette to give it better terms on e-books. Retailers have always pushed publishers for better terms. Barnes & Noble in its prime was famous for throwing its considerable weight around. Just last year, in perhaps one final assertion of its dwindling powers, B&N stocked fewer Simon & Schuster books because it felt the publisher  was not doing enough   to \u201csupport\u201d the chain. Two things make Amazon\u2019s confrontational stance toward Hachette unusual. First, there is the overwhelming power Amazon has in the marketplace. I usually write that it controls a third of the American book business \u2014 new, used and e-books \u2014 although other estimates put it as high as half. Barnes & Noble at its peak had to be mindful of Borders, whose stores were just a short drive away. But Amazon has blown away its online competition. The other unusual thing is Amazon\u2019s multifaceted approach. Most of the time, it has all sorts of ways to encourage you to buy a book: faster shipping, cheaper shipping, a discount, a cheap copy from a third party who was cleaning out his closet. Now, like a river reversing its flow, it is using all sorts of ways to get people not to buy Hachette titles: more expensive, slower shipping, pitching something else instead. Affected are not only popular authors like Michael Connelly and celebrities like the Yankees\u2019 Mariano Rivera  but   also specialist lines   Hachette either owns (Yen Press, a manga line) or distributes (Marvel Comics). \u201cYou can really ruin authors and companies financially by doing this,\u201d wrote a commentator  on a gaming site   . \u201cHeck the manga will take quite a beating. Manga is rather niche, and Amazon is one of the main places you can find it.\u201d The worry for Hachette is that its authors will rise up in anger at the publisher, forcing it to surrender to Amazon\u2019s terms. The worry for Amazon is that it will be perceived of as a thug. If the 4,000 tweets on my two stories on the topic late last week are anything to go by, Amazon might need to worry more. He\u2019s looking at you, Amazon.  http://t.co/dwmyaz8j2u  http://t.co/h2AFy3h1QI Jamie Ford (@JamieFord) 10 May  14 Hachette authors seem outraged at Amazon, not Hachette: God, how I hate Amazon, now more than ever, as they screw my book. RT @JDGsaid: Inside Amazon\u2019s battle with Hachette  http://t.co/dtUhVakSY8 Dave Cullen (@DaveCullen)  14 May 14  And so do other authors: I\u2019ll always be grateful for the early support Amazon gave The Sparrow, but this is evil:  http://t.co/9Jx84yRidv Mary Doria Russell (@MDoriaRussell) 10 May  14 James Patterson, one of Hachette\u2019s biggest authors, upped the stakes,  writing on Facebook   that \u201cthere is a war going on between Amazon and book publishers.\u201d In this moment of upheaval, he added, \u201cI think it\u2019s essential that someone steps up and takes responsibility for the future of American literature and the part it plays in our culture.\u201d Amazon does have its defenders. Hugh C. Howey, who self-published his novel \u201cWool\u201d through Amazon and then sold the rights to Simon & Schuster for a physical edition, said Amazon was being held to a different standard than independent bookstores. \u201cWhen bookstores refuse to carry Amazon-published books, they are celebrated as champions,\u201d he said  in an   article on his website   titled \u201cAmazon and Hachette Go to War.\u201d He\u2019s also upset that Barnes & Noble, in its spat with Simon & Schuster last year, made it all but impossible to find \u201cWool\u201d at its stores. There is, however, a big difference between those earlier incidents and what is happening now. Independent bookstores broke with tradition in 2012 and decided not to sell books published by Amazon. That was their choice. And if customers chose as a result not to shop there, that was their choice. It\u2019s a free country. But Amazon is not saying it is dropping all Hachette books. Instead, it\u2019s as if Barnes & Noble had run ads for Mr. Howey\u2019s \u201cWool\u201d last spring and then, when an eager customer came in to buy it, said there were no copies available but how about a copy of Philip K. Dick\u2019s \u201cThe Penultimate Truth\u201d \u2014 another dystopia about a community living underground \u2014 instead? That sounds like bait and switch, something the Federal Trade Commission frowns on as deceptive. Say, for example, you have lunch with a friend and he tells you he\u2019s reading this great book by Sherman Alexie, \u201cThe Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.\u201d So after lunch you go back to your desk and type on Google, \u201cHow can I buy Alexie Diary\u201d (without quotes). The first result that pops up is Amazon. But Amazon says  it might be a month   before the book, published by Hachette\u2019s Little, Brown Books for Young Readers line, shows up on your doorstep. Amazon wants to have it both ways, telling customers it has the book while discouraging them from buying it. This is why some Internet commentators are saying  the real issue here is deception  as defined by the FTC   \u2013 \u201ca representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumer\u2019s detriment.\u201d Amazon seems confident the uproar will soon die down and it will get what it wants. It declined to comment.

        "content": " Amazon\u2019s secret campaign to discourage customers from buying books by the French publisher Hachette burst into the open on Friday. The uneasy relationship between the retailer and the writing community, which needs Amazon but fears its power, immediately soured, as authors took to Twitter to denounce what they saw as bullying. Among Amazon\u2019s tactics against Hachette, some of which it has been employing for months, are charging more for its books and suggesting that readers might enjoy instead a book from another author. If customers for some reason persist and buy a Hachette book anyway, Amazon is saying it will take weeks to deliver it. The scorched-earth tactics arose out of failed contract negotiations. Amazon was seeking better terms, Hachette was balking, so Amazon began cutting it off. Writers such as Malcolm Gladwell and J.D. Salinger are affected, although some Hachette authors are unscathed. On both sides, the stakes are high. Amazon controls about a third of the book business, which means big publishers cannot live without it. But Amazon risks alienating readers as well as authors, and undermining its carefully wrought image as the consumer\u2019s friend. \u2018\u2018What we are seeing is a classic case of muscle-flexing,\u2019\u2019 said Andrew Rhomberg, founder of Jellybooks, an e-book discovery site. \u2018\u2018Kind of like Vladimir Putin mobilizing his troops along the Ukrainian border.\u2019\u2019 As accusations flew, the two antagonists kept a low profile. Hachette emphasized that it was shipping orders promptly and yet Amazon was still showing the books as being unavailable. Amazon, as usual, declined to say anything at all. The retailer appeared to be using three main tactics in its efforts against Hachette, which owns Grand Central Publishing; Orbit; and Little, Brown, as well as many other American imprints. One is simply warning that books will take a long time to show up. Amazon has been relentlessly expanding its delivery ambitions and just this week announced Sunday deliveries in the United States in 15 more cities, including Austin, Tex., and New Orleans. Its two-day free shipping program has more than 20 million members. But if a reader wants a Malcolm Gladwell book from Amazon, \u2018\u2018Outliers,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Tipping Point,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Blink\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018What the Dog Saw\u2019\u2019 were all listed as taking two to three weeks. A Spanish edition from another publisher was available immediately. Then there is the question of price. \u2018\u2018Outliers\u2019\u2019 was selling Friday for $15.29, a mere 10 percent discount. On Barnes & Noble, the book was $12.74. With some Hachette authors, Amazon seemed to be discouraging buyers in other ways. On the top of the page for Jeffery Deaver\u2019s forthcoming novel \u2018\u2018The Skin Collector,\u2019\u2019 Amazon suggested that the prospective customer buy other novels entirely. \u2018\u2018Similar items at a lower price,\u2019\u2019 it said, were novels by Lee Child and John Sandford. Hachette authors were fuming. \u2018\u2018Like all repressive regimes, Amazon wants to completely control your access to books,\u2019\u2019 Sherman Alexie said in a Twitter post. \u2018\u2018Given AMZN\u2019s near-monopoly position I think it\u2019s an antitrust violation, but the U.S. antitrust regulators are broken,\u2019\u2019 Charlie Stross said, also on Twitter. With the demise of the Borders chain, the struggles of Barnes & Noble, and the ever-precarious position of the few remaining independent stores, authors of all types have grown to depend on Amazon. The Hachette author Marla Heller, who wrote \u2018\u2018The Dash Diet Weight Loss Solution,\u2019\u2019 said Amazon\u2019s actions \u2018\u2018dramatically impacted\u2019\u2019 her sales. On March 19, she said, Amazon raised the price of her book by $8. Then it ran a banner recommending other less expensive diet books. \u2018\u2018Then they let my book go out of stock,\u2019\u2019 she wrote in an email. \u2018\u2018When this problem started, my book was ranked in the top 300 on Amazon. It has since dropped to as low as the top 3,000. While this may be a dispute between an Internet giant and a major publisher, it is the authors who will pay the price.\u2019\u2019 She included a chart of her sales, which were flat. An Amazon spokesman did not respond to a message about Ms. Heller\u2019s complaints. Her book is listed as available with a two- to three-week delay. The discount is 10 percent. The banner promoting other books, however, had disappeared, at least for the moment. The Authors Guild said it had received about 15 complaints Friday from Hachette authors involving more than 150 titles. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019re a monopolist, you get to be a bully,\u2019\u2019 said Richard Russo, the Pulitzer-winning novelist and Authors Guild vice president. \u2018\u2018Maybe you feel immune.\u2019\u2019 Still, he added that he was surprised that Amazon \u2018\u2018would want one more bad story about its practices.\u2019\u2019 Michael J. Sullivan is not sure whom to blame. When the science fiction writer saw in March that his books were suddenly unavailable, he called Amazon, which said Hachette was not shipping the books. Hachette told Mr. Sullivan it was. He does not know whom to believe but knows this: \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the little guys who pay the price.\u2019\u2019 Amazon stopped discounting his novels entirely two months ago. \u2018\u2018To me, this is even worse than the slow shipping aspect,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Sullivan said. When Amazon was founded in the mid-1990s, publishers celebrated it as a counterweight to the chain stores. \u2018\u2018One of the main reasons for doing deals with Amazon in the beginning was because its terms were favorable,\u2019\u2019 said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester. \u2018\u2018They didn\u2019t demand all the concessions that their traditional retail partners asked for. But almost all of those companies, as their relationship with Amazon matured, started to get requests for better terms.\u2019\u2019 For at least a decade, Amazon has been very aggressive toward publishers. One publisher, who declined to be identified because of fear of Amazon, said negotiations with the company resembled a chef deboning a chicken by the end, everything of value had been sliced off. One reason for Amazon to pursue Hachette and other suppliers is that the mood on Wall Street is changing. For years, Amazon\u2019s investing all its profits in new businesses was applauded. Revenue soared, and so did the stock. But shares are down sharply this year and analysts are cutting earnings forecasts. The pending stock exchange debut of Alibaba, the highly profitable Chinese e-commerce company, has underlined the notion that Internet retail does not have to be a break-even game. If Amazon needs to improve its bottom line, it is a dangerous game to make things harder for its customers. Ms. Mulpuru said Amazon was usually cleverer than that. \u2018\u2018This could seem like they\u2019re being spiteful and petty,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s typically not Amazon\u2019s playbook.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " No. 1 on the list of chores the Internet has done away with: dragging yourself to the store to stock up on unwieldy items and carting them home. Many e-commerce companies \u2013 led by Amazon.com and the sites it owns, like Diapers.com and Soap.com \u2013 have made it easy to order even items like toilet paper and diapers without paying a cent for shipping. So when FedEx announced last week   that it would change its shipping prices to charge for the space a package occupies in a truck, not just its weight, many  analysts suggested   that Amazon would be the biggest victim. Shipping costs already eat into  its slim profits , and as any Internet shopper knows, Amazon has a habit of mailing items from a single order in multiple oversize boxes, often with free two-day shipping. But FedEx needs Amazon more than Amazon needs FedEx. Instead, FedEx\u2019s price increase \u2013 which happens in January and which analysts say U.P.S. is likely to match \u2014 could further cement Amazon\u2019s power over retailing by striking a bigger blow to small Internet retailers, the same ones that are already  losing the battle with Amazon . The Internet might have made it possible for the smallest of businesses to sell their wares, but the price of delivering cardboard boxes highlights just how powerful an advantage size can be in the Internet economy. The main reason is that standard shipping rates simply do not apply to Amazon. The company negotiates its own rates with FedEx and other shipping companies, and gets an enviable deal because of the huge volume of business it supplies. Put another way: FedEx would rather give Amazon a sizeable discount than lose Amazon as a customer altogether. \u201cThe big guys always do better whenever there\u2019s a change because they can bring clout to the negotiations,\u201d said Fiona Dias, chief strategy officer at  ShopRunner , an e-commerce service that offers free shipping at a variety of retailers. \u201cLittle retailers don\u2019t have that clout.\u201d The web operation of your local book or shoe store also gets retailer discounts from shipping companies, but they are not as deep. Jon Singer, founder and chief executive of  Singer22 , a retail store and e-commerce site based in Long Island, said he might try to fit more items into smaller boxes if U.P.S., his shipping service, also changed pricing, but he would not start charging shoppers more for shipping. Ultimately, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to eat it.\u201d Smaller boxes would probably be a relief to people who care about the environment or just want more space in their recycling bins. But for small online retailers, it is actually another added expense because they have to buy more sizes of box. Now they generally buy only a few. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to weigh shipping air across the country and paying extra for that, or buying more custom-fitted boxes and paying extra because you have all these size of boxes sitting around,\u201d Ms. Dias said. And FedEx has added incentive to maintain its side of the deal with Amazon, because Amazon has already signaled to FedEx and the other delivery companies that it doesn\u2019t necessarily need them as much as it once did. It is beginning to deliver its own packages, often the same day, and offers  lockers   in various cities where shoppers can pick up the items they ordered. It has even floated the idea of  delivery drones . On Thursday, Amazon announced   an expansion of its partnership with the United States Postal Service (sorry, FedEx) to deliver to more cities for free on Sundays. In part to increase their control over shipping times and prices, other Internet companies including eBay, Uber and Google are also trying  same-day delivery   (perhaps performed someday by a Google driverless car). Walmart.com avoids paying shipping costs by letting customers pick up items  in lockers and stores . Eventually, consumers will pay for the price increases \u2014 even if they don\u2019t know it. Shoppers will switch to another e-commerce site without a second thought to find free shipping, so retailers will probably raise the price of the items they sell instead of charging more to ship them.

        "content": " Amazon has begun discouraging customers from buying books by Malcolm Gladwell, Stephen Colbert, J. D. Salinger and other popular writers, a flexing of its muscle as a battle with a publisher spills into the open. The Internet retailer, which controls more than a third of the book trade in the United States, is marking many books published by Hachette Book Group as not available for at least two or three weeks. A Hachette spokeswoman said on Thursday that the publisher was striving to keep Amazon supplied but that the Internet giant was delaying shipments ''for reasons of their own.'' Hachette is one of the largest New York houses, publishing under the Little, Brown and Grand Central imprints, among many others. The affected books are a mixture of new and old. A just-published memoir, ''Everybody's Got Something,'' by the ''Good Morning America'' anchor Robin Roberts, is taking as long as three weeks to ship, customers were told. So is Stephen Colbert's ''America Again: Re-becoming the Greatness We Never Weren't.'' James Patterson's ''Alex Cross, Run'' published at the end of February, is taking as much as five weeks. ''NYPD Red,'' by Mr. Patterson and Marshall Karp, will take as much as three weeks. Other Hachette books by the prolific Mr. Patterson are readily available, however. Generally, most popular books are available from Amazon within two days. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment. Publishers say the bookseller, whose shares have tumbled 25 percent this year as investors itch for profits, is determined to squeeze as much margin out of its suppliers as possible. ''We have been asked legitimate questions about why many of our books are at present marked out of stock with relatively long estimated shipping times on the Amazon website, in contrast to immediate availability on other websites and in stores,'' said Sophie Cottrell, a Hachette spokeswoman. ''We are satisfying all Amazon's orders promptly.'' But, she added, ''Amazon is holding minimal stock'' and restocking some of Hachette's books ''slowly, causing 'available 2-4 weeks' messages.'' For at least a decade, Amazon has not been shy about throwing its weight around with publishers, demanding bigger discounts and more time to pay its bills. When a publisher balked, it would withdraw the house's titles from its recommendation algorithms. ''Typically, it was about 30 days before they'd come back and say, 'Ouch, how do we make this work?' '' an Amazon buyer told the journalist Brad Stone in his book about the company, ''The Everything Store.'' Sometimes, though, more action was needed. The bookseller pulled all the ''buy'' buttons for Macmillan books in 2010 in a dispute over e-book pricing. Two years later, Amazon was negotiating for a higher discount with the distributor Independent Publishers Group. ''They decided they wanted me to change my terms,'' the IPG president, Mark Suchomel, said at the time. ''It wasn't reasonable. There's only so far we can go.'' Amazon promptly removed more than 4,000 IPG e-books from its site. After lengthy and quiet negotiations, the parties came to terms and the books were restored.",

        "name": "Alibaba filing reflects entry on global stage; Company may raise $20 billion in top I.P.O. in U.S. since Facebook ",
        "content": " The Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group has filed paperwork in the United States to sell stock to the public for the first time, in an embrace of the global capital markets that represents a coming-of-age for China\u2019s booming Internet industry. \u2018\u2018Alibaba is the fastest-growing Internet company in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,\u2019\u2019 said Sameet Sinha, an analyst with B. Riley & Company, a boutique investment bank in Los Angeles. \u2018\u2018They are like an Amazon, an eBay and a PayPal.\u2019\u2019 In the filing on Tuesday, Alibaba said it intended to raise $1 billion in an initial public offering, a figure used to calculate its registration fee. But the company is expected ultimately to raise $15 billion to $20 billion, which could make it the biggest American I.P.O. since Facebook\u2019s $16 billion offering in May 2012. When it makes its debut on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq market, Alibaba is also expected to have a share price that could value the company at roughly $200 billion, more than the market value of Facebook, Amazon.com or eBay, though still trailing that of Google or Apple. The immense size of the offering means that Alibaba shares will probably find a home in many mutual funds and pension funds, and thus indirectly in the portfolios of small investors around the world. Wall Street has been eagerly awaiting the Alibaba I.P.O., seeing it as perhaps the best chance yet to buy into China\u2019s growth. Online shopping there is expected to grow at an annual rate of 27 percent, according to the iResearch Consulting Group, and Alibaba is the leader in that area. Yet the offering will also divulge a company that is relatively unknown in the West and whose complex web of businesses and dealings may put off potential shareholders. Alibaba warned prospective investors that Chinese laws and regulations are difficult to understand and predict. In addition, the prospectus says that Alibaba\u2019s management and major shareholders will control the board, giving ordinary shareholders no power over the direction of the company. In China, Alibaba\u2019s brands are household names. It operates an online shopping center, Tmall, where global companies like Walt Disney, Apple, L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Nike and Procter & Gamble have set up virtual storefronts to sell products directly to Chinese shoppers. Another of its sites, Taobao, is aimed largely at small Chinese firms that want to sell items to Chinese consumers. The company\u2019s digital payment affiliate, Alipay, not only handles transactions on its sites, but is also widely used as a mobile payment system on cellphones in China, much as credit cards are used in other countries. It handled $519 billion worth of payments last year. Last year, the value of all merchandise sold on Alibaba exceeded $248 billion, more than the volume on eBay and Amazon combined. In the last three months of last year, nearly 20 percent of the purchases on Alibaba were made through mobile phones. American companies like Google and eBay can only dream of making the kind of profit margin that Alibaba enjoys. In the 2013 calendar year, Alibaba had net income of $3.56 billion on revenue of $7.95 billion, which translates into a profit margin of roughly 45 percent. In comparison, eBay mustered a 17.8 percent margin. Alibaba has much higher profit margins than American Internet companies, analysts say, because its costs are low. It does not own the merchandise sold on its sites, making money instead from the merchants that pay a commission for access or that buy ads to promote themselves. Alibaba also enjoys a low tax rate of about 10 percent. Alibaba is one of China\u2019s top three Internet players, along with the search engine company Baidu and the media and gaming conglomerate Tencent, but it is bigger and more profitable. Some investors have resorted to indirect routes to get a piece of Alibaba, like buying stock in Yahoo and SoftBank of Japan. SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications giant, is Alibaba\u2019s biggest investor, with a 34.4 percent stake. Yahoo is next, with 22.6 percent. Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s founder, is the biggest individual shareholder, owning 8.9 percent of the stock; he is followed by his longtime lieutenant, Joseph C. Tsai, who owns 3.6 percent. When Yahoo first bought a 40 percent stake in 2005, it valued Alibaba at just $2.5 billion. Six years later, when a consortium of investors took another stake, the company was valued at about $32 billion. Now, analysts estimate that Alibaba may be worth from $130 billion to $235 billion. Many details of the offering, such as the share price and the number of shares to be sold, have not yet been set. Shares are not expected to begin publicly trading for several months, as the Securities and Exchange Commission reviews Alibaba\u2019s offering materials. That time frame increases the risk that investors may be less willing to take a chance on an expensive Internet stock. Technology stocks have fallen sharply in the last few weeks after an impressive run, with some analysts saying that they are overvalued. The market\u2019s appetite for I.P.O.s has also cooled. Alibaba amassed its multibillion-dollar fortune a little at a time, shrewdly capitalizing on two trends \u2014 the rise of the Internet and China\u2019s growing prosperity. The company does some business overseas in markets like Russia and Brazil, and has invested in several American companies. It is also building an American online marketplace called 11 Main. But in its prospectus, Alibaba emphasized that it planned to concentrate on the Chinese market, one whose potential it believes has not been fully tapped. It cited statistics showing that only about 45.8 percent of the country\u2019s population uses the Internet, significantly lower than in the United States and Japan. And only about 49 percent of customers in the country shopped online. Yahoo, which currently owns about 22.6 percent of Alibaba on a fully diluted basis, is set to sell 208 million shares in the offering, leaving it with a roughly 13.6 percent stake. Other big shareholders, like SoftBank, the American private equity firm Silver Lake Partners and the Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner, are considered unlikely to sell much stock. SoftBank, in an earnings report Wednesday, said it would not sell any of its Alibaba shares in the near future, Reuters reported from Tokyo. \u2018\u2018Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean we promise to hold it forever, but for now we consider Alibaba a core strategic partner,\u2019\u2019 especially in Asia, Masayoshi Son, SoftBank\u2019s chief executive, told reporters. SoftBank said its holding in Alibaba had added 66.78 billion yen, or $656 million, to its pretax profit in the fiscal year ended last March, according to Reuters. Mr. Son added that the value of the holding could decline after the I.P.O. because of dilution. Alibaba keeps entering new businesses, including mobile phone service, banking, cloud computing and logistics. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s becoming a conglomerate,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Sinha, the analyst at B. Riley. \u2018\u2018It is going into all aspects of the Internet.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "Big Profits at Alibaba, but Filing Has Gaps ",
        "content": " The  Alibaba   Group  opened its books on Tuesday , revealing a company raking in extraordinary profits from its vast online marketplaces in China. But despite a parade of impressive headline numbers, investors may find themselves struggling to see how real its earnings are. The  company\u2019s financial statements   were released as part of its United States initial public offering, which is expected to take place in the coming months. The big numbers Alibaba has put up will probably excite many on Wall Street. The company says, for instance, that goods worth $248 billion were sold on its marketplaces in 2013, an amount more than that of  Amazon   and  eBay   combined. And Alibaba\u2019s revenue grew 57 percent in the first nine months of its 2013 fiscal year. That pace is faster than at  Facebook , currently one of America\u2019s most successful technology companies. Perhaps more important, Alibaba\u2019s profit margins \u2014 which measure how much money the company gets to keep after paying its costs \u2014 will generate envy across Silicon Valley. The strong figures are encouraging some stock analysts to value the company north of $200 billion, which would be higher than  IBM \u2019s current stock market capitalization. To put their own price on Alibaba, investors will most likely try to compare it against other technology companies. That may be difficult. While Alibaba shares characteristics of some well-known tech names, it is, over all, quite unlike any of them. Like Amazon, Alibaba dominates its home e-commerce market. But, unlike Amazon, it does not amass large amounts of inventory. Instead, like eBay, it merely matches buyers and sellers. In some ways, though, Alibaba resembles  Google . Alibaba gets a very large share of its revenue from sellers who pay for more prominent placement on the marketplaces. That income stream is akin to Google\u2019s ad revenue. But the company did not say exactly how much revenue came from that source. Alibaba is growing faster than eBay, Facebook and Google. Its revenue surged 57 percent in the first nine months of its 2013 fiscal year. Compared with those American companies, Alibaba has far less revenue. But what excites investors is how much profit it earns. Alibaba\u2019s operating profits in those first nine months totaled $3.1 billion, which was equivalent to 48 percent of revenue \u2014 a margin that is far higher than at Google, eBay and Amazon. Its operating margins are also better than those at other public Chinese Internet firms, including  Baidu , a search engine, and Tencent, which is pre-eminent in messaging and gaming. \u201cIn the last year or so, they seem to have pulled ahead of Tencent and Baidu,\u201d said Brendan Ahern of KraneShares, which manages an  exchange-traded fund   that focuses on Chinese Internet stocks. Still, investors seeking to fully understand Alibaba may feel shortchanged by Tuesday\u2019s filing. For one, the company did not provide crucial numbers that would allow outsiders to better gauge the performance of the two online marketplaces that generate nearly all of its revenue. Some investors crave such numbers because they want to see whether Alibaba\u2019s stellar profits growth can continue. Recent history shows that even the most successful Internet companies can be tripped up by abrupt shifts in consumer tastes and changes in technology. \u201cPeople want to know what the breakdown is across the various units,\u201d Mr. Ahern said. \u201cHopefully, as we get closer to the I.P.O., we might see some unbundling.\u201d Alibaba makes most of its money from two major websites that dominate e-commerce in China. Taobao is a hectic-looking online bazaar where consumers can buy almost anything, from fresh groceries to building supplies to pets to concert tickets. The other is Tmall, a more streamlined marketplace where well-known brands are sold. But the filing did not break out revenue or earnings for each marketplace. If growth at one of the two sites starts to slow down, for instance, outsiders might not be able to spot that trend for some time. Instead, Alibaba has combined revenue for both websites under a line called \u201cChina commerce retail business.\u201d That revenue stream was $5.4 billion in the first nine months its 2013 fiscal year, which was more than 60 percent higher than in the same period of 2012. The Chinese retail revenue accounted for 83 percent of the firm\u2019s total revenue of $6.5 billion in the period. Alibaba did not break out costs or earnings for the segment. The Chinese company has gone to some lengths to explain its mobile business. Investors want to see evidence that the company can still post strong profit growth as consumers increase their use of mobile devices for shopping. Alibaba said that in the last three months of 2013, 19.7 percent of \u201cgross merchandise value,\u201d or the value of goods sold on its sites, came from mobile users. That is a sizable increase from 7.4 percent at the end of 2012. Alibaba, however, did not break out details for revenue from mobile. Other large e-commerce firms also do not break out such figures, but Facebook does disclose how much of its advertising revenue comes from mobile. The big question hanging over Alibaba\u2019s I.P.O. is whether it can protect its profits. Sometimes, such high levels of profitability can signal that a company has advantages that may fade and expose it to competition. Alibaba\u2019s supporters, however, say that the firm is fiercely competitive \u2014 and has gone to great efforts to keep rivals at bay. The company has also taken brash steps to defend its revenue that, for now at least, seem to be paying off. The company, for instance, does not allow Baidu, the search engine, to search its marketplaces. As a result, consumers go straight to Alibaba\u2019s sites to perform their shopping searches. This deprives Baidu of a form of ad revenue that Google has long earned when consumers click through to sellers from its search engine. Instead, Alibaba gets the search revenue. As savvy as the Baidu ban looks now, it may become a source of concern. As the number of listings on Alibaba grows, it will need to ensure it attracts a steady flow of traffic to its sites. To do that, it may need the help of outside sites, like Baidu. If that were to happen, it might become less profitable as it is forced to share revenue with other firms. But Alibaba\u2019s public offering document only makes one mention of Baidu. Analysts who are bullish on Alibaba say it makes sense to value it in line with Baidu or Tencent. Those firms have stock market values around 30 times the earnings analysts expect for next year. Applying that multiple to Alibaba\u2019s 2013 calendar-year earnings of $3.6 billion would value the company at $108 billion, well below the $200 billion some analysts think is possible. To get to the higher number, they use estimates of future earnings, which they expect to be much higher as Alibaba increases its presence in China, where e-commerce activity is below that of Western countries. \u201cInvestors are longing for growth \u2014 and here\u2019s a company that really has it,\u201d Mr. Ahern said.

        "name": "When Amazon Collects Sales Tax, Some Shoppers Head Elsewhere ",
        "content": " For years, Amazon watchers \u2014 especially Amazon\u2019s competitors and opponents \u2014 have wondered just how much the company has benefited from not having to collect sales tax on most of its transactions. Now, three economists appear to have answered the question with a new study: In states that recently forced the online behemoth to begin collecting those taxes, Amazon\u2019s sales have fallen sharply. The researchers also found that after Amazon began collecting tax in those states, consumers spent more money with the company\u2019s competitors \u2014 with most of those purchases taking place online, too. The results come as Congress considers legislation that would permit states to force big online retailers to collect sales tax from their residents. The Senate passed the  Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013   in, well, 2013. Some proponents are  optimistic   the House will pass its own bill this year. For their  study   , the researchers \u2014 doctoral candidates and a professor at Ohio State University \u2014 examined data from an online personal finance company that aggregates consumer financial statements. The researchers had access to the credit and debit card transactions of nearly three million consumers across the country, including all of the information you might see on your own credit card statement: the date and time of the transaction, the amount, and the name and location of the seller receiving payment. (The individual consumers were not identified personally; each was represented by a number.) The researchers zeroed in on about 250,000 consumers across the country who spent more than $100 with Amazon in the first half of 2012. For five of the states that imposed a tax-collection obligation on Amazon in 2012 and 2013 \u2014 California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia \u2014 the researchers compared spending at Amazon in each state in the three months before and after the date the policy took effect. Then they measured the difference against spending in the states where the tax rules did not change. \u201cWhat\u2019s novel about our approach is we didn\u2019t approach Amazon and say, \u2018Give us your sales data.\u2019 They\u2019d never in a million years give us this data,\u201d said one of the economists, Brian Baugh. \u201cI think this is their dirty little secret, something they\u2019ve never been forthright about it \u2014 the extent to which this sales tax advantage has benefited them. They\u2019ve never put a number to it.\u201d Mr. Baugh and his colleagues have. They found that across the five states, spending at Amazon dropped almost 10 percent in the three months after sales tax collection began. With larger purchases, the drop-off was even steeper: Transactions over $300, for example, fell by 24 percent. So where, then, are these consumers spending their money? The Ohio State researchers looked into that, too, although the results are murkier. They tallied up online and brick-and-mortar purchases at a dozen of the largest retailers, including Walmart, Target, Home Depot and Best Buy. In most states, they saw a bump in sales, mostly online, after Amazon started collecting tax. Internet sales at these retailers grew 20 percent. Sales at their physical stores increased only 2 percent. Interestingly, customers who switched to these retailers were doing it for other reasons than recovering the sales tax savings \u2014 all of these companies typically have long had to collect sales taxes on online purchases because their brick-and-mortar outlets amount to a physical presence in most states. Many of them are the primary backers of the chief lobbying group for an Internet sales tax, the  Alliance for Main Street Fairness   , a name that, particularly in light of these results, may seem  incongruous   . Transactions also increased at Amazon\u2019s Marketplace \u2014 where independent retailers can sell merchandise through the Amazon website but do not have to collect the tax \u2014 registering a 15 percent bump. (Texas consumers, though, increased their spending at the Marketplace by 41 percent, many times more than in the other four states.) As we  reported   last year, third-party sales through Amazon\u2019s Marketplace are growing so rapidly that they were poised to exceed Amazon\u2019s own retail sales in 2013. The economists did not attempt the difficult task of tracking how much spending changed at other independent retailers, either online or on Main Street. \u201cRetail is so concentrated at these stores now,\u201d explained Mr. Baugh, referring to the major chains. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fault with our approach at all.\u201d In other words, even without knowing how much or even whether small businesses benefited from Amazon\u2019s collection of sales tax, Mr. Baugh says the trend is clear: Money that had been spent at Amazon is mostly being redistributed to other online giants \u2014 and that will very likely intensify if Congress allows broad taxation of Internet sales. \u201cThis legislation is being pushed as a kind of savior to brick-and-mortar stores and a boon to local economies,\u201d he said of the Marketplace Fairness Act, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t appear to be the case to me.\u201d Introducing Erica Bell and Katie Finnegan, New Business Group  Members Study Suggests Online Sales Tax Bill Could Leave Billions  Untaxed A Web Site Tries to Convince Mattress Shoppers to Buy  Online E-Commerce Company Learns to Sell Directly on  Facebook For Local Businesses, the Internet Threat Isn\u2019t Just the Sales Tax",

        "name": "Netflix vs. Amazon, and the New Economics of Television ",
        "content": " It\u2019s been a busy week for the companies in the business of trying to revolutionize how we watch television. Netflix struck a deal to make its video streaming service available through set-top boxes offered by three cable companies, said it would raise its prices for new customers, and publicly objected to a planned merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable. HBO struck a deal to offer its shows on a formidable Netflix competitor, Amazon Prime. Oh, and while we\u2019re at it, AT&T and the Chernin Group said they would introduce a new, $500 million venture to compete in the same crowded market. To make sense of the changing tides of media (and especially television) economics, remember this simple idea: To be successful in the evolving world of media, a company needs to control either the content, or the pipes. If it has neither, it\u2019s a mere middleman, consigned to low or no profitability. Somebody has to create compelling things that people want to watch, whether it\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or an NFL game. The rewards for creating that content are great; if you succeed, you have leverage with whomever will do the distributing, whether a cable network like HBO or AMC or a digital service like Netflix or Hulu. Similarly, whoever controls the ultimate means by which people get information and programming into their living room has a great deal of power. That could in theory be your local phone company or a satellite provider, but in practice for most people in the United States it is the cable company. This, too, is no easy thing to establish. Whereas content creators must navigate the ever-shifting winds of Hollywood, the company controlling the pipes has to spend billions to lay wires under the ground of major cities. If you possess one or the other of those things, desirable content or a means of distribution, you have a strong starting position in the inevitable negotiations over licensing deals. Otherwise, you are a at major disadvantage. Twenty years ago, HBO was closer to a middleman, taking movies made by studios and charging high cable fees to bring them to your cable dial. The problem with that strategy was that it left HBO vulnerable to changing technology. As on-demand movies got better, and as people began consuming more video online, HBO was at risk of being squeezed by the movie studios who provided content and the cable distributors who controlled the pipes. So HBO began more aggressively developing its own content, eventually scoring major hits like \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d that ensured that cable operators (owners of the pipes) would need HBO as much as HBO needed them. HBO\u2019s new deal with Amazon appears to be a way to make some extra money from the back-catalog of older shows, while not cannibalizing people who may want to subscribe to get the hottest, newest shows, including \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d Their deal,  said to be worth   more than $300 million for a bunch of shows, many of which aired more than a decade ago, shows how having original content has given HBO leverage. This time a couple of years ago, Netflix and the video offerings of Amazon Prime were facing the same challenge that HBO did in the 1990s, operating solely as middlemen between producers of content and the people who want to consume it. Each has now taken a page from the HBO of the 1990s, and started trying to come up with the type of original content that will give them leverage with cable companies. That\u2019s why Netflix has produced \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d and a new season of \u201cArrested  Development.\u201d (Not all of its programs have been that successful. Did you watch  \u201cThe Ropes\u201d   or  \u201cBad   Samaritans\u201d   ?). Amazon\u2019s original programming, still early in its development, has generated less buzz (\u201cAlpha House\u201d is the closest thing to a success so far), but is following very much the same strategy. Surely Netflix\u2019s success of some of those shows contributed to the company\u2019s confidence that it can raise prices without losing too many customers. And surely the sense that it is creating products consumers want helped embolden the company to take an assertive stance against consolidation in the cable industry. We might all think we would make brilliant studio titans, but creating great TV series is harder than it sounds; read my colleage David Carr\u2019s  recent column   on Yahoo\u2019s efforts to do so captures the challenge. But if you want to make money distributing video on the Internet, it may be the only way to go. The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

        "content": " When it comes to suspending disbelief about a lack of profits -- the only thing that ultimately matters when it comes to stock valuation -- Amazon.com has been in a class of its own. Its price-to-earnings ratio, a common measure of stock valuation, has at various times topped 3,000 (the market average is about 18) -- and that's when it actually has had a profit. Investors never seemed to care. ''Over the long history of the last eight years, this stock went from $60 to $400, which made all the doubters look stupid while all the believers got rich,'' said Bruce Greenwald, a professor and head of the value investing program at Columbia Business School. ''The fact that Amazon did this in the face of deteriorating operating performance -- slower growth in sales and the evaporation in profit margins -- has made fools of the people who looked at the reality of its operations.'' That may be changing. On Thursday, Amazon reported that revenue grew a healthy 23 percent during the first quarter, topping analysts' forecasts and warming hearts of Amazon loyalists. Revenue gains have always been enough to drive Amazon's stock price higher, and it rose in after-hours trading. But then, on Friday, investors seemed to focus on the one thing they've always ignored: profits. Although Amazon reported revenue of nearly $20 billion, it said its operating income fell 19 percent, to $146 million. Net income was a modest $108 million. Perhaps more unnerving was the company's forecast for next quarter: flat revenue and a loss that might be as big as $455 million. Shares plunged, dropping nearly 10 percent, or more than $30, to just over $300 at Friday's close. They hit a record high of $408 earlier this year. This is the second quarter in a row that Amazon's results have set off selling. Amazon shares plunged 11 percent on Jan. 31, after fourth-quarter revenue and profits were lower than analysts' forecasts. But this time, revenue beat forecasts, suggesting that it's the minimal profit that's worrying investors Other technology stocks have also soared to what some investors have deemed absurd valuations. This week, the noted hedge fund manager David Einhorn warned, ''We are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15 years.'' The market has been roiled in recent weeks, as it was on Friday, by sell-offs in some high-flying technology companies, including Netflix, Tesla and Twitter. But they are still relatively young companies that are trading on expectations that have yet to be tempered by reality, and none of them was as hard hit as Amazon. Even after this week's plunge, Amazon's shares remain expensive by most measures. Its price-to-earnings ratio was still over 500. Amazon's lofty valuation has long baffled many investors and analysts. But one thing they can agree on: Betting against Amazon has invariably turned out to be a mistake over the long term. (The stock has tripled over the past five years.) A dozen Wall Street analysts lowered their ratings on Amazon on Friday, but until this week's earnings report, they were overwhelmingly positive about the company, with 35 of 44 analysts rating the stock a strong buy or buy. Until this week, downgrading Amazon -- no matter what its valuation -- hasn't been a path to popularity, as Eric J. Sheridan, an Internet analyst at UBS Securities, found out in February, when he reduced Amazon to neutral from buy. ''Amazon is the third rail of investing,'' he told me this week. ''I had hundreds of angry people calling me for days. How dare I say anything negative about Amazon?'' By contrast, investors punished Google last week after it reported strong revenue gains and billions of dollars of operating profit. ''Investors won't cut Google any slack,'' Mr. Sheridan said. ''I like Google. The valuation is very reasonable. The quote unquote shock, in their earnings, was that margins were a little weaker than expected. Google is spending on new initiatives. It's just a reminder that they're ambitious and innovative.'' That's exactly what investors have always said they loved about Amazon. ''Google shouldn't be viewed as a mature company,'' Mr. Sheridan said, but it is. Amazon, founded in 1994, is actually four years older than Google. Stock prices are a reflection of investors' predictions of future profits, which is why there's always an element of gazing into a crystal ball. The future earnings of mature companies with long track records can be forecast with considerable accuracy, but for newcomers, especially in untested technologies, it's mostly sophisticated guesswork. Amazon isn't a newcomer, but it has long had a powerful story driving expectations: the notion that it will become the global Walmart of Internet retailing. Walmart has been one of the most successful companies of all time and something of a holy grail for investors. Anyone lucky enough to have invested $1,000 in shares at the time of its 1970 initial public offering and have held them is now worth many millions. Walmart's headiest growth is probably behind it, and Amazon is still expanding revenue by the 23 percent it reported this week. Still, the comparison to Walmart goes only so far. Walmart's operating profit margin is 5.6 percent. Amazon's is a minuscule 0.7 percent. Walmart has been consistently profitable since its earliest days, but for Amazon, bumper profits have always been just beyond the horizon. So analysts and investors have tended to measure Amazon based on revenue rather than profits. On that basis, Amazon's price looks fairly reasonable: Its price to sales ratio is just over 2. (Google's is 5.7.) But that seems to be changing. ''With Amazon you've had a cult investor group that believed that all that matters is revenue growth,'' Mr. Sheridan said. ''The problem is, in the last year and a half, the growth rate has started to slow quickly. It was 40 percent two years ago and now it's close to 20 percent.'' He said there were plenty of other Internet companies growing in the midteens to 20 percent, including Google, Priceline and eBay, and they're much cheaper. ''Reality is starting to settle in,'' he said. And Professor Greenwald noted that product sales -- the core of Amazon's business -- grew by only 18 percent in the quarter, and the projections for the next quarter also suggested slower revenue growth. ''And profits were a disaster,'' he added. Still, should the Walmart analogy cool, Amazon always seems to have another story. This week, it unveiled a deal to stream some HBO programs over the Internet, and it has been commissioning original programming. No matter that Amazon won't gain access to some of HBO's hottest properties, like ''Game of Thrones.'' For some investors, Amazon is now the new Netflix. Or there's the cloud story, in which Amazon's cloud computing services makes it the new Salesforce.com. (On a price-to-sales basis, Amazon is cheaper than either Netflix or Salesforce.) But perhaps Amazon is now spinning too many stories for investors to digest. This week, it also talked about getting into package delivery, a low-margin, high-cost business dominated by United Parcel Service and FedEx. And it even mentioned developing smartphones, an intensely competitive field that has already proved daunting for Google and Microsoft. Still, if history is any guide, this week's drop in Amazon based on one quarter's results may just be another buying opportunity, and not a reversal of a 20-year trend. Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst at RBC Capital markets, reiterated his outperform rating after the earnings were released, though he dropped his price target to $400. He still sees it as a compelling growth story. He noted that Amazon accounted for only 2 percent of global retail sales, ''if that,'' adding, ''So there's a belief that Amazon's long-term growth is likely to be more robust than Google's, because it has lower market penetration.'' Mr. Mahaney said investors trusted Amazon's chief executive, Jeffrey Bezos, even though he's notoriously stingy about releasing information beyond that required by law, and have been impressed by his agility. Amazon ''is a company that created devices when it was just a retailer and successfully went into cloud computing. People keep believing they can catch the latest trend. They've gotten a pass for that.'' He described Amazon as a company that focuses on the long term. ''To their credit, they've made big long-term bets that paid off and were willing to sacrifice short-term earnings,'' he said. ''Getting the right valuation is tough, but I feel very strongly that five years from now,'' Amazon ''will be a bigger part of global G.D.P. than it is now.'' Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, whose comparison to Walmart has helped drive expectations.

        "content": " Operating income rose nearly 10 percent, to $4.12 billion. Net income was $3.45 billion. Those are numbers that would be the envy of just about any company. But not, apparently, when it comes to Google. When the giant Internet search and advertising company released those numbers recently, the stock got pummeled, promptly dropping $20 a share, or 4 percent. Compare that with Google\u2019s e-tailing counterpart, Amazon. On Thursday, Amazon said operating income fell 19 percent, to $146 million. Net income was $108 million \u2014 a rounding error for Google. And the company projected a loss for next quarter. Yet Amazon shares rose in after-hours trading, before easing about 1.7 percent by late-morning trading on Friday in New York. When it comes to suspending disbelief about the lack of profit \u2014 the only thing that ultimately matters when it comes to stock valuation \u2014 Amazon may be in a class of its own. Its price-to-earnings ratio, a common measure of stock valuation, has at various times topped 3,000 (the average for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is about 19) \u2014 and that\u2019s when Amazon has actually had a profit. Other technology stocks have also soared to what some investors deem absurd valuations. In the past week, the noted hedge fund manager David Einhorn warned, \u2018\u2018We are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15 years.\u2019\u2019 The market has been roiled in recent weeks by sell-offs in some technology companies, including Amazon. Sometimes mentioned in the same breath are Netflix, Tesla and Twitter, but they are all still relatively young companies trading on expectations that have yet to be tempered by reality. Amazon has been around for 20 years. Google is hardly the only highly successful company that investors hold to a high standard. But it has much in common with Amazon. Both are big \u2014 Google\u2019s market capitalization is $354 billion, and Amazon\u2019s is $155 billion. They\u2019re both investing heavily in new ventures and technologies. Their chief executives disdain quarterly results and say they invest for the long term. They purport to be unconcerned about day-to-day moves in their stocks (and, as billionaires, they can afford to be). Both companies have the kind of stories, like wearable technology (Google Glass) and Internet streaming (Amazon Prime) that investors usually love. Yet Google\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio is 28. Amazon\u2019s is 571. How could that be? In a supposedly rational market, that question leaves many analysts and investors scratching their heads. But one thing they can agree on: Betting against Amazon has invariably turned out to be a mistake in the long term. (The stock has tripled over the last five years.) Despite Amazon\u2019s lofty valuation, analysts are overwhelmingly positive about the company, with 35 of 44 analysts rating the stock a strong buy or buy. Downgrading Amazon \u2014 no matter its valuation \u2014 isn\u2019t a path to popularity, as Eric J. Sheridan, an Internet analyst at UBS Securities, found out in February, when he reduced Amazon from \u2018\u2018buy\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018neutral.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Amazon is the third rail of investing,\u2019\u2019 he told me in the past week. \u2018\u2018I had hundreds of angry people calling me for days. How dare I say anything negative about Amazon?\u2019\u2019 By contrast, Mr. Sheridan said, \u2018\u2018Investors won\u2019t cut Google any slack.\u2019\u2019 He added: \u2018\u2018I like Google. The valuation is very reasonable. The quote-unquote shock, in their earnings, was that margins were a little weaker than expected. Google is spending on new initiatives. It\u2019s just a reminder that they\u2019re ambitious and innovative.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s exactly what investors say they love about Amazon. A problem for Google\u2019s valuation may be that the company has been so profitable for so long. Stock prices reflect investors\u2019 predictions of future profits, which is why there\u2019s always an element of gazing into a crystal ball. The future earnings of mature companies with long track records can be forecast with considerable accuracy, but for newcomers, especially in untested technologies, it\u2019s mostly sophisticated guesswork. Google was profitable almost from Day 1 and has often exceeded forecasts. As a result, its profits and margins are closely scrutinized, and even a minor disappointment can set off selling. For Amazon, bumper profits have always been just beyond the horizon. So analysts and investors tend to measure Amazon based on revenue rather than profits. On that basis, Amazon looks fairly reasonable: Its price-to-sales ratio is just 2. Google\u2019s is 5.7. And Amazon has a powerful story behind it: the notion that it will become the global Walmart of Internet retailing. Walmart has been one of the most successful companies of all time and something of a holy grail for investors. Anyone lucky enough to have invested $1,000 in shares at the time of its initial public offering in 1970 and holds them is now worth many millions. \u2018\u2018With Amazon, you\u2019ve got a cult investor group that believes that all that matters is revenue growth,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Sheridan said. \u2018\u2018The problem is, in the last year and a half, the growth rate has started to slow quickly. It was 40 percent two years ago, and now it\u2019s close to 20 percent.\u2019\u2019 Even after the recent rally, Amazon shares have dropped 16 percent over the last three months, so Mr. Sheridan\u2019s February call was timely. Still, should the Walmart analogy cool, Amazon always seems to have another story. In the past week, it unveiled a deal to stream some HBO programs over the Internet, and it has been commissioning original programming. No matter that Amazon won\u2019t gain access to some of HBO\u2019s hottest properties like \u2018\u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019\u2019 For some investors, Amazon is now the new Netflix. Or there\u2019s the cloud story, in which Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services make it the new Salesforce.com. (On a price-to-sales basis, Amazon is cheaper than either Netflix or Salesforce.) This kind of thinking drives traditional value investors crazy. (Value investors typically look for relatively low-priced stocks.) Bruce Greenwald, a professor and head of the value investing program at the Columbia Business School, called Amazon\u2019s profits this quarter \u2018\u2018a disaster.\u2019\u2019 Still, \u2018\u2018over the long history of the last eight years, this stock went from $60 to $400, which made all the doubters look stupid while all the believers got rich. The fact that Amazon did this in the face of deteriorating operating performance \u2014 slower growth in sales and the evaporation in profit margins \u2014 has made fools of the people who looked at the reality of its operations.\u2019\u2019 Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets, is one of the 35 analysts with a buy recommendation on Amazon. He sees it as a compelling growth story, noting that while Google now accounts for roughly 15 percent of the total worldwide advertising market, Amazon accounts for about 2 percent of global retail sales, \u2018\u2018if that.\u2019\u2019 So, he said, \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a belief that Amazon\u2019s long-term growth is likely to be more robust than Google\u2019s, because it has lower market penetration.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Mahaney said investors trusted Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos \u2014 even though he\u2019s notoriously stingy about releasing information beyond that required by law \u2014 and were impressed by his agility. Amazon \u2018\u2018is a company that created devices when it was just a retailer and successfully went into cloud computing. People keep believing they can catch the latest trend. They get a pass for that.\u2019\u2019 But he also likes Google and has a buy rating on Google shares. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s O.K. to like both stocks,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Google will do better in a defensive market, and Amazon is more of a momentum play.\u2019\u2019 The simple answer may be that the stock market isn\u2019t always rational. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really just a handful of people that determine the price of the stock,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Mahaney said. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re hedge fund managers and big fund managers. They\u2019re all people with more money than time, and they\u2019re Amazon Prime customers. They use it, and they love it. There\u2019s just not the same emotional attachment to Google.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " The stock market fell sharply on Friday, dragged down by disappointing quarterly results from Amazon and Ford Motor. Tensions between the United States and Russia over Ukraine also weighed on the market. Worried investors sold their riskier assets and moved into the traditional havens: bonds, gold and stocks like utilities that pay high dividends. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 15.21 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,863.40. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 140.19 points, or 0.9 percent, to 16,361.46 and the Nasdaq composite fell 72.78 points, or 1.8 percent, to 4,075.56. Friday's sell-off was enough to push the Dow, S.&P. 500 and Nasdaq into the red for the week. Technology stocks, which have been volatile for the last two months, were again a hotbed of selling. Shares of Amazon, the world's largest online store, fell $33.32, or nearly 10 percent, to $303.83. Amazon reported late on Thursday that, despite a 23 percent increase in revenue, its operating profit fell 19 percent from the period last year, and that investments would probably lead to a second-quarter operating loss. Amazon dragged the rest of the technology sector lower, making it one of the worst-performing sectors in the S.&P. 500. Netflix fell more than 6 percent, Priceline dipped almost 5 percent, Facebook fell 5 percent and Twitter dropped more than 7 percent. Investors have had little patience for companies missing their forecasts, said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. ''The market is in a precarious position at the moment, and overreacts to bad news far more than it did last year,'' he said, noting the 10 percent drop in Amazon's stock, even though the company met analysts' forecasts for the most recent quarter. The rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine also weighed on investor sentiment. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday accused Russia of failing to live up to its commitments to ease the Ukraine crisis. Mr. Kerry said bluntly that unless Moscow took steps to de-escalate the situation, Washington would impose more sanctions. In a separate event, Ukraine's deputy foreign minister said he feared a Russian invasion was imminent. Investments thought to be less risky were among the few assets to rise on Friday. Bond prices rose, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down to 2.67 percent from 2.68 percent Thursday, while its price rose 5/32, to 100 24/32. Gold rose $10.20, or 0.8 percent, to $1,300.70 an ounce. Shares of Visa fell $10.47, or 5 percent, to $198.93 after it warned that American sanctions were prompting Russian banks to use other companies to process payments. President Vladimir V. Putin said Russia would create its own payment-processing system. MasterCard was also hurt by the news. Its stock fell $3.69, or 5 percent, to $70.66. Visa's decline made up roughly half of the Dow's fall on Friday. The stock market declined in the face of an encouraging report on consumer sentiment. The University of Michigan said that consumer confidence surged in April, to 84.1 in April from 80 in March. The latest rating was just a point below the 85.1 reached last July, which was the highest in nearly seven years. Americans have cut back on debt and benefited from steady hiring and rising stock and home prices, the report said. Just 28 percent said this month that their finances were worsening, down from 37 percent in March and the lowest level since April 2007.

        "name": "Amazon's Revenue Grew 23 Percent in First Quarter, Nearing $20 Billion ",
        "content": " Amazon defines corporate prosperity in terms of sales growth rather than profit. By its definition, which has been embraced on Wall Street, the big Internet merchant had a strong first quarter. Amazon's revenue grew 23 percent to $19.74 billion, up from $16.07 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Its growth surpassed analysts' average estimate of $19.4 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. ''The top-line growth is still there,'' said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''This is largely how they have to deliver.'' The company's net income rose in the quarter to $108 million, compared with $82 million in the first quarter of 2013. Amazon's earnings of 23 cents per share hit analysts' diminished forecasts. Three months ago, analysts were expecting 54 cents a share, but a rougher-than-expected fourth quarter trimmed their expectations. Excluding one-time transactions, the company's operating profit fell 19 percent to $146 million, down from $181 million in the first quarter of 2013. In after-hours trading, Amazon shares rose slightly, after increasing nearly 4 percent in the regular trading session, closing at $337.15 a share. Relative soft spots did surface in the quarter. International sales, for example, rose a more modest 18 percent, to $7.88 billion, a bit below the overall corporate performance. Amazon's overseas media sales -- digital movies, television programs and books -- were particularly weak, increasing less than 4 percent, to $2.64 billion. But in a conference call, Tom Szkutak, Amazon's chief financial officer, emphasized the corporate growth trend. ''We are pleased with the overall fundamentals,'' he said. ''A lot of areas contributed to growth.'' Amazon recently raised the price of its Prime unlimited merchandise shipping and video service by 25 percent, to $99 a year. That price increase, Mr. Szkutak suggested, was not facing resistance from customers. He declined to give specific numbers, but did say the company is ''very encouraged,'' with Prime memberships increasing week over week. Amazon's cloud computing business, Mr. Szkutak said, is growing rapidly, despite cutting prices to remain a leader at a time when many technology companies like Google, IBM and Microsoft are investing heavily in the market for remotely supplied computing. Amazon does not break out the numbers for its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services. Its results are included in an opaque category the company calls ''other.'' Revenue growth in the other category rose 58 percent from a year ago, to $1.26 billion. Amazon Web Services, Mr. Szkutak said, is ''a big part of that.'' In the second quarter of this year, Amazon said that it expected sales from $18.1 billion to $19.8 billion, or growth between 15 percent to 26 percent, compared with the year-earlier quarter. And the company said it anticipated reporting an operating loss of between $55 million to $455 million, compared with an operating profit of $79 million in the second quarter of 2013. That guidance, the company said, includes $455 million for stock-based compensation for its employees and other costs. Never exactly a laggard on the product development front, Amazon has been outdoing itself recently. Its long-rumored phone is reported to be on the verge of appearing. A set-top box called Amazon Fire is now out, to mixed reviews. And Amazon is spending $300 million or so on programming from HBO, led by ''The Sopranos.'' A few weeks ago, Amazon quietly introduced Dash, a wand that can be used to reorder household items, from toilet paper to guitar strings. If the needed product does not have a bar code to scan, Dash has a microphone to take orders. The video commercial for Dash shows children restocking their house. And on Wednesday, Amazon introduced Prime Pantry, a grocery delivery service for its Prime customers. This ceaseless innovation comes as some of Amazon's long-term advantages are eroding. Sales tax reform is stalled in the House of Representatives, but Amazon has made enough deals with individual states that a sizable chunk of its customers now pay the tax. That makes items purchased from Amazon from 5 to 10 percent more expensive. In a paper released this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research, transactions in five states -- California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia -- were examined. All the states began collecting tax from Amazon purchases in the last two years. The study concluded that households had reduced Amazon expenditures by an average of 9.5 percent. Asked about the impact of states requiring Amazon to collect sales tax, Mr. Szkutak pointed to Amazon's sales numbers in North America, up 26 percent in the first quarter, suggesting there was scant effect so far.

        "content": " Amazon will stream a selection of HBO series, mini-series and original movies as part of its Prime subscription service, the latest alliance between technology and entertainment companies trying to capture viewers who are moving online. The deal, announced on Wednesday, deepens the commitment of Amazon and its chief, Jeffrey P. Bezos, to the tough but potentially lucrative television market, while escalating its competition with Netflix and other competitors offering programming over the Internet. Beginning May 21, Amazon Prime members will have access to older HBO shows like \u2018\u2018The Sopranos\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018The Wire,\u2019\u2019 and mini-series like \u2018\u2018Band of Brothers\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Angels in America.\u2019\u2019 Some seasons of current series, like \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 will also be available. It is the first time HBO is making its licensed content available to online consumers outside of the traditional pay TV business. Certain shows, like \u2018\u2018Sex and the City\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Curb Your Enthusiasm,\u2019\u2019 which are subject to other licensing deals, are excluded from the deal, as are standout hits like \u2018\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018True Detective.\u2019\u2019 It also excludes the roster of studio movies that HBO offers subscribers. The deal represents a small step outside of HBO\u2019s highly profitable cable subscription model and toward the web-only streaming that many see as the future of television. But it is notable that some of the channel\u2019s most popular programming was excluded and thus remains firmly entrenched within the traditional cable business. Terms of the agreement, described as \u2018\u2018multiyear,\u2019\u2019 were not disclosed, but a person briefed on the deal said it was worth at least $300 million. That kind of price tag underscores the enormous value attached to the kinds of popular, high-quality movies and TV shows that can reliably draw audiences. \u2018\u2018The Sopranos\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018The Wire,\u2019\u2019 in particular, are considered pioneers of novelistic, highbrow TV as a genre and are rewatched like classic movies. Amazon, the giant e-commerce company, has been vying with competitors like Netflix to acquire such content and also produce original programming in the hope of persuading viewers to subscribe to its $99-a-year Prime service, which began by offering free shipping on merchandise but has grown to include other offerings. Amazon has also discussed the possibility of HBO\u2019s producing shows for it, according to a person knowledgeable about the relationship between the companies. \u2018\u2018Today\u2019s news is a clear sign that Amazon is intent on closing the content gap with Netflix,\u2019\u2019 Stephen Shin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients. He said the move validated Netflix\u2019s decision, announced on Monday, to raise prices for new customers, so that it can \u2018\u2018fund more content acquisition.\u2019\u2019",

Although bricks-and-mortar retailers and state governments pushed for Amazon to collect sales tax, they did not necessarily benefit. Sales increased only 2 percent at local stores, but rose nearly 20 percent at competing online retailers that do not charge sales tax. For expensive purchases, the rivals saw a 24 percent increase. At this point, there is little that will bring online shoppers back to bricks-and-mortar stores. Nor is there much that will keep them shopping at Amazon if they can find a price even a few dollars lower on another site. Other surveys have shown that people will gladly leave a site for another that offers free shipping. Last month, Amazon  increased the price   of its Prime service 25 percent to $99 a year, which provides free shipping.

Once people have paid their $99, they feel a psychological pull to buy from Amazon to make their investment worth it \u2014 even if a lower price is only a click away.

        "name": "Companies Back Initiative to Support OpenSSL and Other Open-Source Projects ",
        "content": " SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The nonprofit Linux Foundation and more than a dozen prominent technology companies are to announce an initiative on Thursday to fund crucial open-source projects. Chief among those projects  will be OpenSSL,   the Internet security method used by millions of web servers and Internet-connected devices. Researchers recently discovered a major flaw in OpenSSL that they called Heartbleed. Amazon, Cisco, Dell, Facebook, Fujitsu, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NetApp, Rackspace, Qualcomm and VMWare have each pledged $100,000 a year over the next three years to the Core Infrastructure Initiative, the effort organized by the Linux Foundation, which supports the popular Linux computer operating system. Each backer will select representatives to sit on a steering committee along with open-source developers and academics. The committee will direct money to open-source projects. In turn, the money will be used to fund fellowships for developers to work on open-source projects full time. It will also pay for security audits, computing and testing infrastructure, travel, and coordination among companies that may be working on similar projects. The Core Infrastructure Initiative will start with OpenSSL.  Despite its widespread use,   OpenSSL is managed by only one full-time developer and a small, volunteer staff. Open-source projects are usually software development efforts organized and run by volunteers, connected on the Internet, who work together to build, maintain and improve free software. Ideally, they check one another\u2019s work in a peer review system. It has led to the creation of widely used software like Linux and the web browser Firefox. But security experts and even the open-source movement\u2019s biggest advocates acknowledge that Heartbleed revealed  that some crucial   open-source systems are underfunded and suffering from a lack of resources. In an interview on Wednesday, Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, said the most significant issue was a lack of awareness regarding which open-source projects needed what, something he said the Core Infrastructure Initiative will help address. \u201cThis is not just about the money, but the forum,\u201d Mr. Zemlin said. \u201cInstead of responding to a crisis retroactively, this is an opportunity to identify crucial open-source projects in advance. Right now, nobody is having that conversation, and it\u2019s an important conversation to have.\u201d The Core Infrastructure Initiative is one of many such projects to be discussed since the Heartbleed bug was made public two weeks ago. The early open-source advocate Eric S. Raymond and other leaders in the open-source community like Paul Vixie, founder of the Internet Systems Consortium, a nonprofit Internet \u201caction tank,\u201d have been discussing a similar initiative called the Internet Civil Engineering Institute. The idea was to fund security audits of crucial open-source software like OpenSSL and the Internet Time Service protocol, which synchronizes computer times over the Internet. It is used by major financial exchanges and maintained by one developer in Maryland. \u201cThe problem is the usage volume of the Internet is going way up and the Internet\u2019s complexity is going up \u2014 straining this volunteer cadre of developers,\u201d Mr. Raymond said in an interview last week. \u201cThis is a recipe for serious trouble down the road.\u201d Heartbleed has also prompted a number of volunteers from OpenBSD, another open-source project, to comb through OpenSSL code  in order to find mistakes and fix them . Elsewhere, some  were making T-shirts that say \u201cI Heartbleed OpenSSL,\u201d   featuring the Heartbleed logo, selling them online and donating some of the proceeds to the OpenSSL project. Steve Marquess, who runs the OpenSSL Software Foundation, which finds contract work for OpenSSL developers, said last week that the OpenSSL Project had received more than $17,000 in donations since Heartbleed was exposed, most of that from individuals. He noted that the biggest donation, as of last Friday, was $300 and the smallest was 2 cents (which unfortunately had been donated through PayPal, which took both cents). But this week, the project hoped to bypass PayPal fees by accepting donations using another open-source method: Bitcoin.

        "content": " A global forest mapping system developed by a team of scientists from the University of Maryland, Google and the United States government is now able to pinpoint exactly where and at what rate deforestation is occurring around the world. The results are alarming. The world is losing the equivalent of 50 soccer fields of forest every minute. In Brazil -- home to 60 percent of the Amazon rain forest and a major component of the planet's climate system -- the rate of deforestation jumped 28 percent during 2012-13. Environmentalists say a 2012 change in Brazil's regulations governing forest conservation is partly responsible. Brazil had been making good progress. From a high of 10,588 square miles in 2004, deforestation dropped to 1,797 square miles in 2011; the number of metric tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere dropped as well, from 1.1 billion metric tons in 2004 to 298 million metric tons in 2011. These successes resulted from aggressive enforcement of the country's 1965 Forest Code, and a 2006 soy moratorium, a voluntary pledge brokered by the Brazilian government, agribusiness and environmental groups to prevent trade in soybeans cultivated on deforested land. Soybeans aren't the only cause of deforestation in Brazil, but they are a major factor. Brazil is now the world's second-largest producer of soybeans after the United States. Soybeans have been a boon to Brazil's economy, and global demand is growing. Under intense pressure from agricultural interests, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies approved legislation in July 2012 that rolled back many provisions of the 1965 Forest Code, reduced the amount of reserve areas in the Amazon and gave amnesty to past violators. To her credit, Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, thwarted some of the most damaging provisions of the new legislation, but the rate of deforestation still rose. The soy moratorium has been extended until the end of 2014, by which time Brazil plans to have in place new mechanisms to monitor soybean cultivation on deforested land. These mechanisms must be backed by credible enforcement. And developed countries need to do more to help Brazil, Indonesia and other nations whose forests are at risk protect a resource in which everyone has a stake.",

        "content": " In his spare time two years ago, Jarrett Streebin operated a gift-card reselling business that required his customers to send their gift cards to him. He wanted to give them preprinted, prepaid shipping labels to make the process easy, but it proved more complicated and took longer than he expected. That\u2019s because trying to integrate with carriers like the United States Postal Service or U.P.S. required an A.P.I. key \u2014 a code used to gain access to an application program interface. Getting that code, he said, required time and paperwork because helping small businesses integrate wasn\u2019t a core focus for most shipping companies. Tired of waiting, Mr. Streebin built his own A.P.I. and started a business around it,  EasyPost , which allows businesses to integrate with carriers like the Postal Service, UP.S., Federal Express and DHL. To develop the service, Mr. Streebin talked to lots of small-business owners with e-commerce stores to identify their postage and shipping pain points. \u201cThey said it was really hard to integrate the major carriers into their online stores,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were copying and pasting addresses to create labels because you have to manually enter addresses.\u201d Their options were limited: They could hire a developer to integrate the services of carriers, which can be costly because it\u2019s complicated. Or they could use an expensive software program. Mr. Streebin\u2019s A.P.I. enabled the businesses to offer their customers address verification, rate information, customs forms, tracking and the ability to make a purchase. He started the company in September 2012 with a note about EasyPost that he wrote and posted on Y Combinator\u2019s  Hacker News , a news-sharing website read by programmers and entrepreneurs. Hundreds signed up for the service, and David Lee, founder and managing partner of  SV Angel , became one of the first investors, putting $200,000 behind the company ( Ron Conway , a well-known investor, is a \u201cspecial adviser\u201d to SV Angel). EasyPost has raised $3 million to date. The company launched a test version of its product in December 2013, and today the API is used to make \u201cmillions of shipments a month,\u201d Mr. Streebin said. EasyPost, which has eight employees, operates on a subscription basis, with fees as low as $5 for 100 packages a month and running as high as thousands of dollars a month for high-volume shippers. Customers can print labels with EasyPost that include the address, postage and a tracking number. Although the aim originally was to create a tool for small e-commerce businesses, EasyPost now serves companies of all sizes those with a few thousands dollars of revenue a year as well as those with hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Other than Amazon, Mr. Streebin said, \u201cthere are no companies completely optimized for this kind of shipping.\u201d One client,  RocksBox , is a subscription-based website that allows customers to \u201cborrow\u201d three pieces of costume jewelry at a time to wear and return (with an option to buy). The company has 12 employees and sends hundreds of shipments a day to all 50 states, said Meaghan Rose, founder and chief executive. About a year ago, Ms. Rose switched to EasyPost from a system she considered highly labor intensive. \u201cWe had to type in a destination address for each shipment we sent, which isn\u2019t scalable, and we didn\u2019t have tracking information,\u201d she said. RocksBox no longer has to weigh every shipment before sending it out and printing labels is now much faster, Ms. Rose said. Some of EasyPost\u2019s more tech-savvy business customers develop their e-commerce sites around EasyPost\u2019s A.P.I. Others use plug-ins to enable integration, or they hire a developer. That costs little, Mr. Streebin said, because the integration is relatively simple. He said his biggest challenge now is hiring enough developers to keep up with his company\u2019s growth. \u201cWe\u2019re in San Francisco, where everyone wants to build more software,\u201d he said, \u201cso continuing to find good people that are excited about this industry is a challenge. If I had an extra four engineers, I could build a lot more stuff.\u201d The company is looking to add carriers, offer same-day service and improve tracking updates through email, text messages and push notifications. \u201cWe do rigorous customer surveys and a lot of customer support ourselves, so we can see all the issues and keep a running tab,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ask customers all the time, \u2018Would you use the service more if it was like this?\u2019 We listen to them and then we go build it.\u201d You can follow Eilene Zimmerman on  Twitter .

        "content": " A love of books and bookstores runs deep in the sinews of this city, where gray skies and drizzle can drive a person to drink, or read, or both. A long-running annual survey ranks Seattle as America\u2019s second-most literate big city, behind Washington, D.C., as measured by things like the number of bookstores, library resources, newspaper circulation and education. Amazon.com Inc. also calls Seattle home. And in recent years, as many small independent bookstores here and around the nation struggled or closed their doors, owners often placed blame for their plight on the giant online retailer\u2019s success in delivering best sellers at discount prices, e-readers and other commodities of the digital marketplace. \u2018\u2018They seem to be after everyone and everything,\u2019\u2019 one Seattle-area bookstore owner, Roger Page, fulminated on his store\u2019s blog last year. He added, \u2018\u2018I believe there is a real chance that they will ruin the publishing world.\u2019\u2019 But now there are signs of a thaw in those tensions, at least here in the city that most embodied them. As Amazon has exploded with growth, hiring thousands of tech workers at its downtown headquarters and helping bolster the Seattle economy, local bookstore owners have seen a surprising new side of the company they loved to hate: Many Amazon employees, it turns out, are readers who are not shopping at the company store. \u2018\u2018A lot of our customers work at Amazon,\u2019\u2019 said Tracy Taylor, the general manager at the Elliott Bay Book Company, one of the city\u2019s largest independent booksellers. The store, about a mile from Amazon headquarters, last year earned what Ms. Taylor called the \u2018\u2018first substantial profit\u2019\u2019 in almost 20 years, enough to even pay employee bonuses. Whether it is Amazon or something else, the broader pattern is unmistakable, said Oren J. Teicher, the chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, a national bookstore trade group. \u2018\u2018Seattle has become one of the most successful independent bookstore cities in the country,\u2019\u2019 he said. Tom Nissley, 46, a writer and former Amazon employee with 10 years at the company who lives with his family in northern Seattle, embodies this odd new d\u00e9tente. In his old life, he was a senior editor, helping Amazon promote and choose featured book titles for its website. Then, in 2010, he won enough money on the television quiz show \u2018\u2018Jeopardy!\u2019\u2019 \u2014 about $235,000 as an eight-game champion \u2014 to quit his day job and write full time, publishing last fall a compendium of literary history and trivia, called \u2018\u2018A Reader\u2019s Book of Days.\u2019\u2019 Last month, Mr. Nissley\u2019s bookish-in-Seattle tale came full circle when he signed a contract to buy and run his own small independent bookstore. The shop, Santoro\u2019s, which he plans to rename Phinney Books, is in a neighborhood, Phinney Ridge, with plenty of Amazon employees, many of whom Mr. Nissley knows as former colleagues or neighbors, and who he hopes will shop at his store (or at least come in to offer commiseration and advice). The purchase price, essentially the value of the inventory, was $35,000. \u2018\u2018I think I know what I\u2019m getting into,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I hope so.\u2019\u2019 The soon-to-be-Phinney is by no means a Goliath. At 1,200 square feet, and about 5,000 titles on the shelves, it is a retail space that might have once fit a five-and-dime. Glass windows open onto the street where other local businesses like Bluebird Ice Cream, Caffe Vita and Cornuto Pizza line the block. Part of Mr. Nissley\u2019s optimism is that he believes local shops have increasingly found their feet in how to avoid competition with Amazon, or other giant retailers, by offering services or products that only a local can provide. He plans to offer, in addition to books, a line of paper goods, toys and vinyl handbags made by the business that his wife, Laura Silverstein, started. He is also convinced, he said, that the e-book revolution, which seemed ready a few years ago to sweep away the old world of pages and print, has reached a plateau. Publishers, wanting to keep independent bookstores alive, have also helped \u2014 easing traditional repayment rules for books, or helping with promotions or advertising. As a backup plan, he was hoping for some additional earnings from appearing on \u2018\u2018Jeopardy!\u2019\u2019 again as part of a runoff of past champions, called \u2018\u2018Battle of the Decades.\u2019\u2019 (However, he lost on the first day of the return tournament.) He is also finishing a novel, which he hopes will one day sit alongside his other book on a shelf at Phinney Books. The strength of the local economy and the shop-local movement underpins everything, as even Mr. Page, the bookstore owner, concedes, despite his Amazon-size fears. He co-owns Island Books with his wife, Nancy. \u2018\u2018Amazon makes great contributions to the vitality of Seattle,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Page said in an interview. \u2018\u2018They are putting their footprint right down in the middle of Seattle and they\u2019re pouring a lot of money and energy into it, and it is one of several drivers that are making this a vibrant, interesting and expensive place to live.\u2019\u2019 And Amazon as a big local employer also means Amazon as a big producer of Amazon expatriates like Mr. Nissley with bookselling experience. Two of Island Books\u2019 10 employees, Mr. Page said, also once worked at Amazon. Mr. Nissley said that some of his favorite memories of Amazon were the early years when employees at headquarters would occasionally be asked to pitch in at the warehouse, helping pack books before they went out into the world. In his new shop, he said, he will be going back in a way to that simpler time.",

        "content": " Seventeen years ago I wrote a book, which you can find on Amazon and Google and elsewhere online. This is unusual only because my book was never published. It\u2019s called \u201cGoths,\u201d fitting for a title that has left its traces on the Internet but does not exist. The traces themselves are ghostly. Other than the title, Amazon lists only the publisher (Random House Trade), language (English) and ISBNs (one with 10 digits, the other with 13). Google goes further by giving the publication date (March 1, 1998) and promising a cover image \u2014 but it turns out to be a placeholder. And unlike Amazon, Google neglects to mention that the book is a hardcover. Google admits, \u201cWe haven\u2019t found any reviews in the usual places,\u201d which in this case would be the planet Earth. \u201cBe the first to review this item,\u201d Amazon encourages, but has as yet found no takers. If the Internet existed before 1997, I was not aware of it. I was an MS-DOS user and a visiting lecturer in creative writing; I had never heard of any email extensions other than .edu. I lived in Seattle with my boyfriend, an English professor, and I had a cappuccino every evening so that I could write into the night. I was working on a book commissioned by my old friend Ruth. We had collaborated on a project that began a decade earlier. Ruth, a children\u2019s book editor at Random House, was a regular reader of my stories and perhaps the only reader of a manuscript I wrote in my Alphabet City apartment, among my first in New York. It was a sixth-floor walk-up with a cheese-stick operation on the ground floor. A byproduct of cheese-stick manufacturing is a vomit-like smell. A byproduct of living in Alphabet City in the late \u201980s was the experience of being chased by some thug up all five flights of stairs and, on another occasion, having the fire escape gate pried open by a crook after my bag of pennies. That life was interesting, if not an outright thrill. One day a flier appeared in the front hall warning that bullets were being fired from the tenement behind ours. How alarmist! It\u2019s true my room faced onto the garbage dump between the two buildings. But it was a bedroom, where one spends most of one\u2019s time horizontal \u2014 any bullets would fly right over me. I was horizontal in that room except when I was writing. Between desk and bed, the only pieces of furniture, was a passage just wide enough to squeeze my legs into. I sat on my bed and typed on my Selectric III. I was writing a novel inspired by Cormac McCarthy\u2019s early work, his unheroic, unpsychological Southern gothic tales. My novel was about a deranged trucker who travels up and down I-95 looking for boys to pick up and throw into the freezer compartment of his big rig, where they stiffen in the forms of chairs and other household items. Ruth, cannily perverse, thought this would make a great children\u2019s book. And so was born \u201cPhantom Trucker,\u201d the campy tale of a deranged undead trucker who travels up and down I-95 looking for \u2026 But he only threatens to throw our young hero into the freezer compartment, and he\u2019s sore and intent on revenge only because he once swerved to avoid hitting a boy and ended up colliding with a light post. A hero! The book had a beautiful cover, and I showed up at bookstores as the Phantom Trucker, complete with glistening face gash, much to the derision of the older children. I enjoyed every second of this experience. The book Ruth commissioned was supposed to kick off a new young adult imprint. She came out to do a photo shoot with a model for the cover. I put on black clothes and purple lipstick for my author photo. At the time, living in Seattle and all, I was into most everything goth, especially its literary touchstones \u2014 Keats, Mary Shelley, Nick Cave. I was given money \u2014 was I given money? \u2014 to write. Each evening I sat in my apartment, with its view of the lit-up Space Needle and the Olympic Mountains rising blackly beyond, and I wrote. I took a break to walk the neighborhood, burnished even at night by the world of my story, then came home to write some more. The plot, as I recall, concerned an impossible girl gradually abandoned by everyone in her life. She cracks up, and out of this freak show she emerges as a goth. Her severe new mask, erected as a barricade, allows her to access and express a newfound sensitivity, which wins her friends and a boyfriend and entr\u00e9e into the goth scene. A soap-opera plot inverted: only once she goes from haughty blonde to ghoulish brunette can she be reintegrated into the community. At some point on her journey she starts thinking in Cure lyrics. Even Ruth couldn\u2019t make anything out of this one. She had helped me with the first 50 pages, but I went on to write the next 500 on my own. Faced with this pile of high drama, Ruth retreated into silence. She didn\u2019t seem to like the manuscript but couldn\u2019t say why. This is the most frustrating, even painful, position for a writer to be in vis-\u00e0-vis an editor; she herself seemed agonized. We never spoke again. The entire imprint shut down before it could even be started. I moved to Silicon Valley with my professor boyfriend, and we promptly broke up. When I surfaced I found myself swimming in a vat of money; my share was minuscule, but at the age of 34 I had joined the middle class. Silicon Valley 1997: right place at the right time for anyone in need of a life, or at least a job. I still didn\u2019t know how to use Windows. But Oracle ended up paying me, along with a dozen other literary types, to sit around adjudicating what were to us the big issues of the day: Should homepage be one word or two? Is it a Web site? A web site? A Website? Did we dare even imagine a website? Good times, those. The Internet had come into existence for me \u2014 but I had no presence on it. Why should I have? What had I done to merit any notice? I had continued to write but published nothing other than a few book reviews in The San Francisco Chronicle. It wasn\u2019t until years later, when companies had stopped hiring English majors as English majors and I had reinvented myself twice over, that it occurred to me to look for evidence of myself online. Other than a notice of a real estate transaction I had been involved in, \u201cPhantom Trucker\u201d was pretty much it, remaindering across the Anglophone world for a penny. There were so many sites offering this book for a penny that it took me awhile to notice the skeletal listing out there also under my name. \u201cGoths.\u201d It had been published after all! And then I looked more closely. Before abandoning it, Random House had done just enough to launch the book into the world. I\u2019m tempted to be the first to review this item. Flesh out the listing, give it a description, rate it on Goodreads (where it already is present), send out so many tentacles so far into cyberspace that they could never be yanked back to earthly obscurity. Or if the manuscript is extant or the floppy disk unbent, publish the book myself. I sent another book into the world that is even more spectral than \u201cGoths.\u201d Just before I moved to Seattle, the manuscript of a novel I had written was chosen as the runner-up in the Associated Writing Programs Award Series in the Novel. That summer I received a handwritten note from the judge telling me that my book, \u201cThe Creek Is Gone,\u201d would have won if the ending were better. More closed \u2014 she wanted to know what happened to the characters. (My professor boyfriend helpfully reminded me he had told me I needed to work on my endings.) All that I needed to do, the judge told me, was to keep on. These words sustained me over the years, though not as much as a book contract would have \u2014 this was the prize for first place \u2014 or an academic position, which the person who won held the last time I checked. \u201cThe Creek Is Gone\u201d never even got as far as having an ISBN assigned; no publisher was interested. The traces of this book linger only in my head. Ghostly book, ghostly life I might have had. Mais je ne regrette rien. \u201cThe Creek Is Gone,\u201d and it ain\u2019t coming back. \u201cGoths,\u201d too. As for my visible work, as Jorge Luis Borges would have called it, I had risked my life writing the book that became \u201cPhantom Trucker,\u201d sitting in my Alphabet City window. Wouldn\u2019t it have been better if it had ended up as something approaching the quality of its model \u2014 \u201cChild of God,\u201d say \u2014 rather than as a kids\u2019 thriller? No, the absence of \u201cGoths\u201d in bookstores is no great hole in the world. By not being published, this book stands a chance of being better than the manuscript, better than what work I have published. The \u201cGoths\u201d out there on the Internet isn\u2019t the book I wrote; it\u2019s the ideal form of one I haven\u2019t yet written. Jason K.

        "content": " A flaw has been discovered in one of the Internet\u2019s key security methods, potentially forcing a wide swath of websites to make changes to protect the security of consumers. The problem was first discovered by a team of Finnish security experts and researchers at Google last week and disclosed on Monday. By Tuesday afternoon, a number of large websites, including Yahoo, Facebook, Google and Amazon Web Services, said they were fixing the problem or had already fixed it. Researchers were still looking at the impact on consumers but warned it could be significant. Users\u2019 most sensitive information \u2014 passwords, stored files, bank details, even Social Security numbers \u2014 could be vulnerable because of the flaw. The most immediate advice from security experts to consumers was to wait or at least be cautious before changing passwords. Changing a password on a site that hasn\u2019t been fixed could simply hand the new password over to hackers. Experts recommended that, before making any changes, users check a site for an announcement that it has dealt with the issue. \u2018\u2018This is a good reminder that there are many risks online and it\u2019s important to keep a watchful eye around what you\u2019re doing, just as you would in the physical world,\u2019\u2019 said Zulfikar Ramzan, the chief technology officer of Elastica, a security company. The extent of the vulnerability was unclear. Up to two-thirds of websites rely on the affected technology, called OpenSSL. But some organizations appeared to have had advance notice of the issue and had already fixed the problem by Tuesday afternoon. Many others were still working on restoring security. Because attackers can use the bug to steal information unnoticed, it is unclear how widely the bug has been exploited \u2014 although it has existed for about two years. On Github, a website where developers gather to share code, some were posting ways to use the bug to dump information from servers. The Finnish security researchers, working for Codenomicon, a security company in Saratoga, Calif., and security researchers at Google found the bug in a portion of the OpenSSL protocol \u2014 which encrypts sessions between consumer devices and websites \u2014 called the \u2018\u2018heartbeat\u2019\u2019 because it pings messages back and forth. The researchers called the bug \u2018\u2018Heartbleed.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a serious bug in that it doesn\u2019t leave any trace,\u2019\u2019 said David Chartier, chief executive at Codenomicon. \u2018\u2018Bad guys can access the memory on a machine and take encryption keys, usernames, passwords, valuable intellectual property, and there\u2019s no trace they\u2019ve been there.\u2019\u2019 Organizations were advised to download immediately the newest version of the OpenSSL protocol, which includes a fix, and quickly swap out their encryption keys. It also meant organizations needed to change their corporate passwords, log out users and advise them to change their own passwords. Then companies began taking inventory of what they might have lost. But because the flaw would allow attackers to surreptitiously steal the keys that protect communication, user passwords and anything stored in the memory of a vulnerable web server, it was virtually impossible to assess whether damage had been done. Security researchers say they have found evidence that suggests attackers were aware of the bug. Researchers monitoring various \u2018\u2018honey pots\u2019\u2019 \u2014 stashes of fake data on the web aimed at luring hackers so researchers can learn about their tools and techniques \u2014 found evidence that attackers had used the Heartbleed bug to gain access to the fake data. Actual victims may be out of luck. \u2018\u2018Unless an attacker blackmails you, or publishes your information online, or steals a trade secret and uses it, you won\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been compromised,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chartier said. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s what makes it so vicious.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chartier advised users to consider their passwords compromised and urged companies to deal with the issue quickly. Security researchers say it is most important for people to change passwords to sensitive accounts like their online banking, email, file storage and e-commerce accounts, after first making sure that the website involved has addressed the security gap. By Tuesday afternoon, many organizations were heeding the warning. Companies across the web, including Yahoo, Amazon and PayPal, began notifying users of the bug and what was being done to mitigate it. Tumblr, the social network owned by Yahoo, said it had issued fixes and warned users to immediately swap out their passwords. \u2018\u2018This still means that the little lock icon (HTTPS) we all trusted to keep our passwords, personal emails and credit cards safe was actually making all that private information accessible to anyone who knew about the exploit,\u2019\u2019 the security team at Tumblr, which is part of Yahoo, wrote on its site. \u2018\u2018This might be a good day to call in sick and take some time to change your passwords everywhere \u2014 especially your high-security services like email, file storage and banking, which may have been compromised by this bug.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "Expressway to Amazon in a Box ",
        "content": " CORRECTION APPENDEDOSTENSIBLY, the new Amazon Fire TV is a streaming media set-top box -- an Internet-connected device that lets you watch video from Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Crackle or a few other outlets and play games with or without a controller, which is sold separately. In reality, the Fire TV is a small, flat, matte black Trojan horse intended to sell you even more Amazon goods than you already buy. I prefer streaming that is content-neutral, or that at least allows me to find the best deal. This is not that box. That's not to say the Fire TV isn't likable. The packaging and the hardware are tidy, premium and elegant. With its design and $99 price, the device pretty clearly targets the Apple TV as its primary competition. The two streaming devices have similar designs -- and designs on your regular purchasing. The setup for the Fire TV is remarkably simple, although the package does not include an HDMI cable, which I find annoying, although not uncommon. The Bluetooth remote pairs relatively easily; mine was a little slow to respond until I walked around the backside of the box. It's still a smoother Bluetooth setup than most. There is no clunky entering of a code or anything like that; just hold down the ''home'' button on the remote or controller for a few seconds, and you're off. Amazon is promoting its voice integration, which allows searches for content by speaking aloud. I like that the remote uses a microphone button to start voice commands, rather than just passively listening all the time. But that button has to be held down while you're speaking, which is unintuitive and easy to forget. That's the least of what is wrong with the voice search, or any search for that matter. Yes, you can use your voice to search for content on the Fire TV. But the box will return movie, TV and game results only from the Amazon catalog, even if you have downloaded and signed into other apps, like Netflix's. You could argue that it makes (some) sense that Amazon would index only its own catalog. But the company noted that the voice search also includes Vevo, a site that features music videos and some musician-related documentary content. So the capability exists. For movie, TV and game content, however, the Fire TV does not search across platforms at all -- or display other viewing options in its search results or show summaries. If a show is available to stream free via Netflix, you would never know it. For example, when I searched for ''House of Cards,'' all I saw were options to rent episodes for $2.99. Even though I had downloaded and signed into Netflix on the Fire TV, there was no mention of Netflix availability on the show summary, even under the tantalizingly named ''More ways to watch'' menu. The same happened with the documentary movie ''The Summit.'' It is a $4.99 rental on Amazon, but when I searched for it on Netflix, I found that I could stream it free with my subscription. Oddly, at least one Amazon search result noted that the title was also available on Hulu Plus; it's possible a more universal search is in the works but just not yet in place. In the short term, though, if you already pay for Netflix or Hulu Plus and are tricked into paying again to rent a movie or show from Amazon, you will end up feeling like, well, a sucker. By contrast, the Roku streaming media box (priced from $49 to $99) can search across multiple platforms, what it calls its ''top channels.'' So can TiVo, which is one of my favorite streaming media boxes because its integrated search includes live TV; on-demand sources like Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon; and even, depending on cable or satellite provider, on-demand results. Other Fire TV features feel less than baked as well. Parental settings are available that require a pass code to buy or download movies, shows or games; but no content rating restrictions are attached. When I searched for Pokemon, the box recognized the name and sent me through to search results, where the first one listed was the Walking Dead game series. That is not a child-friendly outcome. As for content, the Fire TV has less than Roku or Apple TV; there are no HBO Go or Spotify, which are big misses. The Fire TV has 180 apps in total; Roku has some 1,200. In addition to the need to hold down a button for voice search, other aspects of the interface are not entirely intuitive either, and they can be jarring. Title images are huge, and it is hard to see many listings on a page. Getting information like summaries or availability takes multiple clicks, and the visual highlights that signal navigation are overly subtle. I also wish voice controls were better integrated throughout the interface, for data entry, searching other apps or even navigation. The Fire TV tries to stand apart from the crush of streaming set-top boxes by offering games. Possibly Amazon is positioning it as an alternative to the much more expensive PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, which are able media-streaming devices that also, obviously, do gaming. So far, though, the game selection is less than impressive: Deus Ex, Minecraft and Despicable Me are the titles I recognized. One exclusive game, Sev Zero, is included and Amazon promises more. The $40 controller is fine, although compared with those of the new Xbox One and especially the PlayStation 4, it is less comfortable and polished. My son tried to play Minecraft using it, and found it highly frustrating; when I tried it, I agreed. The Fire TV, over all, is a decent effort that suffers from entering a crowded field. Even if the market for streaming media boxes is currently small -- just 8 percent of consumers in the United States own one, according to Forrester Research -- the competition is more mature, and not limited to boxes. Internet-connected or ''smart'' TVs offer similar access to streaming media without taking up an HDMI port or room on a component shelf. Google's $35 Chromecast, the darkest and cheapest horse in the race, lets you stream supported content from a phone, computer or laptop with almost magical ease. I find that combining my smart TV (a Panasonic Viera) with a Chromecast for easy streaming of Netflix or YouTube is right for me; I have Netflix, Amazon video, Pandora or Spotify, and that is just about all I need. I have not seen anything in the Fire TV that would persuade me to buy it. Nevertheless, Amazon has a huge reach and is aggressively promoting the Fire TV; if the company continues to improve the content, games and interface, the Fire TV could be an accessible entry-level device. But if I had to buy just one gadget to introduce someone to streaming Internet video, I would get a Chromecast or a Roku until the Fire TV grows up a bit. Correction: April 8, 2014, Tuesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Machine Learning column on Monday, about the Amazon Fire TV set-top box, misstated the voice search range of the device. The Fire TV box searches the music video site Vevo as well as the Amazon catalog. It is not limited to the catalog alone. The error was repeated in an accompanying picture caption. Voice search is a feature Amazon is promoting on the Fire TV, though it will retrieve results only from the Amazon catalog.",

        "content": " Amazon is a retailer that makes and sells entertainment. This week it took a big step toward a future in which shopping and video are tightly linked, perhaps even inseparable. If Amazon has its way \u2014 and it did not become one of the United States\u2019 most valuable companies by drifting with the current \u2014 even watching home movies of your sister\u2019s adorable children or a friend\u2019s crazy cat will become marketing opportunities. The company began selling a device Wednesday that lets consumers watch Amazon\u2019s extensive video library, as well as play a wide array of games on their television sets. \u2018\u2018Amazon has a vested interest in making sure it is present at every moment of possible consumption, which is all the time,\u2019\u2019 said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. \u2018\u2018It wants to get into that television screen and start to build a relationship.\u2019\u2019 Amazon Fire TV is part of a multibillion-dollar effort by Amazon to move from selling goods produced by others, which is traditionally a low-margin business, to presiding over the entire process of creation and consumption. Physical formats such as books, CDs and DVDs are being replaced by downloads and streaming. In books, Amazon has largely made this transition. It makes e-readers and tablets and then sells the content for them. Some writers produce their books exclusively for Amazon. Video is much more competitive. Netflix, which began by renting the same DVDs that Amazon was selling, is the leader both in streaming video and creating original shows to feature on it. \u2018\u2018Streaming is the long-term future of video,\u2019\u2019 said William V. Power, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Company. \u2018\u2018Amazon needs to capitalize on that. The prize is controlling much of the living room and a big piece of the economy.\u2019\u2019 Fire TV, which arrives after years of speculation, costs $99. In addition to content from Amazon\u2019s studios, it offers programming the retailer licenses for an estimated 20 million Amazon Prime subscribers. Those customers pay as much as $99 a year for a membership that includes videos and shipping. Other Fire content will come from established players like Hulu and Netflix. Another source will be homemade films. With a separate $40 controller, Fire TV can also be used to play games, including a version of the popular Minecraft. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re missionaries about inventing and simplifying on behalf of customers,\u2019\u2019 Peter Larsen, an Amazon vice president, said at a Manhattan news conference held to announce the device. Mr. Larsen, speaking on a stage outfitted to look like a living room, said devices from competitors, which include Roku, Google and Apple, have three problems: It is too hard to search for content, performance is slow and unreliable, and the content is a closed system. He noted that Apple TV users could not get the full Amazon Prime experience. Among the enhancements promoted for Fire TV: a voice search function that allows users to say a name like George Clooney and see results instantly pop up, and a prediction feature that knows what you want and queues it up. Amazon is leveraging its position as a retailer to expand into new fields, something it has become very good at. \u2018\u2018Because we\u2019re selling millions\u2019\u2019 of set-top boxes already, \u2018\u2018we hear what\u2019s working and we hear what\u2019s not working,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Larsen said. Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, was not present at the news conference. Dave Limp, another Amazon executive, dismissed all the new and old companies that will be duking it out with Amazon in the consumer\u2019s living room. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t go at it from the perspective of who you\u2019re going to compete against,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t think of this as a sporting event where there has to be one winner.\u2019\u2019 But in a chart on Amazon\u2019s site, where the company has already started selling the Fire TV, it made explicit comparisons with those competitors, whom it judged wanting. Amazon\u2019s chart was immediately attacked for leaving out things that its competitors did better. For instance, Roku offers more options for live-streaming sports events. Consultants are already laying bets. \u2018\u2018The likely winners are Apple and Amazon, both of which offer entire ecosystems, are excellent at merchandising content and are capable of subsidizing prices and making up the revenue elsewhere,\u2019\u2019 said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps Media Technology Strategies. \u2018\u2018The likely losers are Google, which has a poor track record in entertainment devices and is not very good at merchandising content, and Roku, which has no ecosystem or synergies with other devices or services.\u2019\u2019 For all the lure of new devices like Google Glass, Americans still spend four hours a day watching television. The dream of securing that audience has fired up many a technology magnate. Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Intel all have tried, with mixed results. No one has done for TVs what Steven P. Jobs did for computers, portable music players and cellphones. TV was on Mr. Jobs\u2019s to-do list. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use,\u2019\u2019 he told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. \u2018\u2018I finally cracked it.\u2019\u2019 But then he died, and Apple fans have waited. Apple TV, a set-top box, is the leader in the field, but until recently Apple referred to it as a \u2018\u2018hobby.\u2019\u2019 In Amazon\u2019s vision, the television becomes a supercharged home-shopping ecosystem. \u2018\u2018Imagine,\u2019\u2019 Mr. McQuivey said, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m watching a Jason Bourne movie. He\u2019s on the run through Europe. The movie pauses and lets you move into an interactive game with Bourne. Or maybe he goes through Vienna, and you always wanted to go there, so here\u2019s how you could plan a trip or at least buy a book about it. Amazon will know who to offer these deals to because those people are already in front of it at that moment.\u2019\u2019 This was not something Amazon talked about much at the news conference, but Amazon is also not a company that gives away its secrets. One small clue to the company\u2019s ultimate plans: Amazon is promoting an app for its box from a start-up called Magisto. It offers free automatic video-editing software that can reduce the three-hour movie you shot about your cat to something far snappier. The company says it has tens of millions of users, a small percentage of whom choose to make their films public. Magisto has the potential to be a sort of YouTube for Amazon customers. Reid Genauer, chief marketing officer of Magisto, said he had no idea how Amazon would generate revenue from Magisto\u2019s app but speculated that the metadata in each video could be automatically analyzed in the same way Google automatically scans Gmail messages and then advertises against them. \u2018\u2018In the same way that I write, \u2018I\u2019m coming to see you in England,\u2019 and then I see airfare ads,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Genauer said, \u2018\u2018you could see how someone could use metadata in video to sell products. If I watch a lot of kitty videos, you would sell me kitty products.\u2019\u2019 CORRECTION: As published in the International New York Times An article on Friday about Amazon\u2019s new set-top box to stream video, games and other entertainment to customers\u2019 television sets misstated part of the company\u2019s content offerings.

        "name": "Liberty Media Will Sell Most of Its Investment in Barnes & Noble ",
        "content": " Nearly three years ago, Liberty Media had grand ambitions to acquire Barnes & Noble, before settling for a big stake. Now it appears that the media conglomerate has had enough. Liberty announced on Thursday that it would sell almost its entire position in Barnes & Noble, the nation's last major bookstore chain, removing one of the company's major backers as it struggles to compete with Amazon and navigate the shifting landscape for books and media. In 2011, Liberty had paid $204 million for a 17 percent stake in the bookseller. After the latest move, Liberty will have just under a 2 percent stake. The move disappointed Barnes & Noble's other shareholders. After Liberty's announcement, Barnes & Noble's stock dropped sharply, and by the end of the day was down 13.52 percent, trading at $19.12 a share. The loss of a major shareholder is the latest setback for Barnes & Noble, which has closed dozens of stores and has trouble fulfilling its digital ambitions. Five years ago, the company had a promising product with its first Nook e-reader, a device that quickly became a major competitor to the iPad from Apple and the Kindle from Amazon and grabbed more than 25 percent of the e-book market. But the Nook's early promise faded as the tablet space grew more crowded and Amazon undercut Barnes & Noble on price. Last summer, Barnes & Noble's chief executive and the architect of its digital strategy, William Lynch, abruptly resigned. Nook sales dropped more than 50 percent in the most recent fiscal quarter from a year ago. Michael P. Huseby, the company's new chief executive, said in February that it was looking for an outside partner to produce its devices in the future. Investors have been waiting for signs that Mr. Huseby had a plan to stop the bleeding. The company has eliminated close to 200 positions in its Nook division -- about a quarter of its work force -- through layoffs and attrition. Its offices in Palo Alto, Calif., where Barnes & Noble engineers and designers had been dreaming up new Nook devices, have been severely depleted. Its traditional bookstores have remained more stable, though core comparable store sales are drifting lower. Barnes & Noble executives have said that the bookseller will close about 20 of its more than 600 stores each year for the next decade. Liberty's stake in the company had been considered a vote of confidence by one of the media industry's savviest investors, the billionaire John C. Malone. But back in 2011, just before he agreed to invest in Barnes & Noble, Mr. Malone acknowledged that it was risky making a bet on the bookseller. ''It would be a bit of a flier for us, on whether or not Barnes & Noble can play competitively with the likes of Apple and Amazon in the digital transformation,'' Mr. Malone said in 2011 at the Allen & Company media conference. Both Liberty and Barnes & Noble described the move on Thursday as one that would give the embattled retailer more room to plot its future. When the stock sale closes on Tuesday, Liberty will lose the right to keep two representatives on the Barnes & Noble board. Gregory B. Maffei, the conglomerate's chief executive, will step down, though Mark Carleton, a senior vice president, will stay on as a director. ''By reducing our preferred position and eliminating some of our related rights, Barnes & Noble will gain greater flexibility to accomplish their strategic objectives,'' Mr. Maffei said in a statement. The investment in Barnes & Noble was always something of an outlier for Mr. Malone and Liberty. Though Liberty continues to own a range of media assets, including the Atlanta Braves baseball team and a major stake in the ticket seller Live Nation Entertainment, the company's notable focus has been the cable television business. Liberty's investment in Barnes & Noble came as the bookseller's Nook e-reader business showed potential. But after the Nook failed to take off, efforts to split off the digital business from the company's retail stores faltered and Liberty concluded it had little interest in owning a stake in a declining brick and mortar operation. The retrenchment comes as Mr. Malone, 73, is trying to return to his roots. Last year, Liberty Media acquired a stake in Charter Communications, a regional cable operator. Charter subsequently pursued a hostile takeover of Time Warner Cable, the country's second-largest cable operator. Had Charter succeeded, Mr. Malone, once known as the King of Cable, might have been on his way toward reclaiming the throne. But after months of pursuit, Charter was outflanked by Comcast, the country's largest cable operator, which swooped in with a $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable. Though Charter lost out in its pursuit of Time Warner Cable, it may still look to acquire other cable assets, including the three million subscribers Comcast has pledged to divest itself of. And in Europe, Mr. Malone is also on the prowl for cable assets. Liberty Global, which he controls, has emerged as the most influential pay television company on the Continent. Earlier this year, Liberty Global agreed to buy Dutch cable operator Ziggo, adding to its stable of European cable operators, which also includes Telenet in Belgium and Virgin Media in Britain. On Thursday, Leonard Riggio, Barnes & Noble's chairman, said that while Liberty had been a strong supporter of the retailer, the company would now have a greater ability to pursue unstated ''various strategic options.'' Liberty's exit could open the door for Barnes & Noble to be sold entirely or split it up, options that executives have been considering for some time. A Barnes & Noble bookstore in Pasadena, Calif. John C. Malone is chairman of Liberty Media, which is selling all but 2 percent of its holdings in Barnes & Noble. It bought the stake in 2011.

        "content": " After I wrote  my article   on Wednesday about Amazon\u2019s new Fire TV set-top box, I received an email from a reader that summed up the retailer\u2019s challenge \u2014 and opportunity. \u201cI am just writing with a follow-up question about these boxes being offered by Amazon, Roku, Apple and others,\u201d Mary Woodhead wrote. \u201cI can\u2019t quite get an understanding of their advantage \u2026 I can stream Netflix on my television as things stand. I would love to break free of my Comcast bill but am not quite willing to give up watching tennis and cycling.\u201d How, in other words, do I get more of what I want for less? On this question hinges the future of television and the companies that are trying to reinvent it. Amazon, for instance, will need to persuade Ms. Woodhead of one of two things: She will derive enough benefits from Amazon Prime, which gives access to a video library, and Fire TV, which plays the movies on a TV, to make it worth paying an additional $225 on top of what she is paying Comcast, which is about $220 a month for Internet, phone and cable. Or that Amazon is offering such a great package that she does not need Comcast anymore. She can then cancel its cable service and perhaps \u2014 this is Jeff Bezos\u2019s dream \u2014 use the hundreds of dollars she saves to buy things on Amazon. In theory, at least, a set-top box should be pretty compelling when compared with cable. \u201cInstead of spending $80 a month for 500 channels of nothing on,\u201d said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps Media Technology Strategies, a consultant firm, \u201cyou get to pick what you want to watch when you want to watch it.\u201d But if it were really that simple, he added, on-demand entertainment would have already triumphed. There are two big hold-ups, though. \u201cFirst, on-demand TV is something that consumers don\u2019t understand, because they have no experience of it. It\u2019s like on-demand music services (Spotify, Rhapsody, Beats Music): great idea, but it\u2019s a new consumer behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cOn-demand music with full major label licensing has been around since 2002 but even now there are, I\u2019m guessing, barely 10 million users of it in the U.S. Introducing new consumer media behaviors is very hard and takes a very long time.\u201d He continued, \u201cBy comparison, cable is the same as broadcast \u2013 just more channels and you don\u2019t have to adjust an antenna. And similarly, iTunes is just like a record store \u2013 except bigger selection and you don\u2019t have to leave your house. (Ditto Amazon and bookstores.) Eventually one of the Internet video services is going to figure out continuous programming (think Pandora for TV) and that will make a big difference, but rights are a big obstacle to that happening.\u201d The second problem is the one that Ms. Woodhead alluded to: Comcast is her Internet provider. \u201cCable companies are very slow in offering \u2018bare\u2019 Internet service because they know that once they do, their subscription pay-TV businesses will go into free fall.\u201d Mr. Rosenblatt said. \u201cPaying $80 a month for cable versus $8 a month for Netflix \u2013 it\u2019s not quite an apples-to-apples comparison in terms of programming, but it\u2019s pretty scary to pay-TV providers nonetheless.\u201d What might help clarify this situation for Ms. Woodhead is the increased competition Amazon is bringing to the market. That will force all the players to sweeten their deals or at least be explicit about what they are offering. Who can give her the cycling and tennis she wants at a price she craves? Amazon, I have no doubt, will relentlessly try to win over Ms. Woodhead\u2019s heart. How much programming will it take? In my article, I wrote, incorrectly, that the service would make its debut with no sports channels. Fire TV actually has several, even if you don\u2019t buy Amazon\u2019s argument that channels like Showtime are sports channels because they sometimes show sports. Roku, by comparison, lists 66 sports channels, but then it cannot ship me headphones or popcorn the way Amazon does. Amazon says it will rapidly add more sports programming, and presumably other kinds too. This will cost a bundle. Perhaps that is why Amazon stock fell $8, or more than 2 percent, on Thursday.

        "content": " CORRECTION APPENDEDAmazon is a retailer that makes and sells entertainment. On Wednesday, it took a big step toward a future in which shopping and video are tightly linked, perhaps even inseparable. If Amazon has its way -- and it did not become one of the country's most valuable companies by drifting with the current -- even watching home movies of your sister's adorable children or a friend's crazy cat will become marketing opportunities. The company began selling a device Wednesday that lets consumers watch Amazon's extensive video library as well as play a wide array of games on their television sets. ''Amazon has a vested interest in making sure it is present at every moment of possible consumption, which is all the time,'' said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''It wants to get into that television screen and start to build a relationship.'' Amazon Fire TV is part of a multibillion-dollar effort by Amazon to move from selling goods produced by others, which is traditionally a low-margin business, to presiding over the entire process of creation and consumption. Physical formats such as books, CDs and DVDs are disappearing, replaced by downloads and streaming. In books, Amazon has largely made this transition. It makes e-readers and tablets and then sells the content for them. Some writers produce their books exclusively for Amazon, happily living in the digital equivalent of a company town. Video is much more competitive. Netflix, which began by renting the same DVDs that Amazon was selling, is the leader both in streaming video and creating original shows to feature on it. ''Streaming is the long-term future of video,'' said William V. Power, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Company. ''Amazon needs to capitalize on that. The prize is controlling much of the living room and a big piece of the economy.'' Fire TV, which arrives after years of explicit rumors and intense speculation, costs $99. In addition to content from Amazon's own studios, it offers programming the retailer licenses for an estimated 20 million Amazon Prime subscribers. Those customers pay as much as $99 a year for a membership that includes videos and shipping. Other Fire content will come from established players like Hulu and Netflix. Yet another source will be homemade films. With a separate $40 controller, Fire TV can also be used to play games, including a version of the extremely popular Minecraft. ''We're missionaries about inventing and simplifying on behalf of customers,'' Peter Larsen, an Amazon vice president, said at a Manhattan news conference held to announce the device. Mr. Larsen, speaking on a stage outfitted to look like a living room, said devices from competitors, which include Roku, Google and Apple, have three problems: It is too hard to search for content, performance is slow and unreliable, and the content is a closed system. He noted that Apple TV users could not get the full Amazon Prime experience. Among the improvements and enhancements promoted for Fire TV: a voice search function that allows users to say a name like George Clooney or a genre like horror and see results instantly pop up, and a prediction feature that knows what you want and queues it up. Amazon is leveraging its position as a retailer to expand into new fields, something it has become very good at. ''Because we're selling millions'' of set-top boxes already, ''we hear what's working and we hear what's not working,'' Mr. Larsen said. Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, was not present at the news conference. Dave Limp, another Amazon executive, dismissed all the new and old companies that will be duking it out with Amazon in the consumer's living room. ''We don't go at it from the perspective of who you're going to compete against,'' he said. ''We don't think of this as a sporting event where there has to be one winner.'' But in a chart on Amazon's site, where the company has already started selling the Fire TV, it made explicit comparisons with those competitors, whom it judged wanting. Amazon's chart was immediately attacked for leaving out things that its competitors did better. For instance, Roku offers 66 sports channels. At the moment Amazon is offering only a few, although it says more are on the way. Since set-top boxes give consumers an incentive to cut the cable cord, Fire TV also puts Amazon in the sights of Comcast, the country's dominant cable system. Consultants are already laying their bets. ''The likely winners are Apple and Amazon, both of which offer entire ecosystems, are excellent at merchandising content and are capable of subsidizing prices and making up the revenue elsewhere,'' said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps Media Technology Strategies. ''The likely losers are Google, which has a poor track record in entertainment devices and is not very good at merchandising content, and Roku, which has no ecosystem or synergies with other devices or services.'' For all the lure of new devices like Google Glass, Americans still spend four hours a day watching television. The dream of securing that audience has fired up many a tech magnate. Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Intel all have tried, with mixed results. No one has done for TVs what Steven P. Jobs did for computers, portable music players and cellphones. TV was on Mr. Jobs's to-do list. ''I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use,'' he told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. ''I finally cracked it.'' But then he died, and Apple fans have waited. Apple TV, a set-top box, is the leader in the field, but until recently Apple referred to it as a ''hobby.'' In Amazon's vision, the television becomes a supercharged home-shopping ecosystem, no matter what happens to be on. ''Imagine,'' Mr. McQuivey said, ''I'm watching a Jason Bourne movie. He's on the run through Europe. The movie pauses and lets you move into an interactive game with Bourne. Or maybe he goes through Vienna, and you always wanted to go there, so here's how you could plan a trip or at least buy a book about it. Amazon will know who to offer these deals to because those people are already in front of it at that moment.'' This was not something Amazon talked about much at the news conference, but Amazon is also not a company that gives away its secrets. One small clue to the company's ultimate plans: Amazon is promoting an app for its box from a start-up called Magisto. It offers free automatic video-editing software that can reduce the three-hour movie you shot about your cat to something far snappier. The company says it has tens of millions of users, a small percentage of whom choose to make their films public. Magisto has the potential to be a sort of YouTube for Amazon customers. ''We see a real opportunity to use television as a tool for personal storytelling and personal communications, as opposed to just broadcast communications,'' said Reid Genauer, chief marketing officer of Magisto. He said he had no idea how Amazon would generate revenue from Magisto's app but speculated that the metadata in each video could be automatically analyzed in the same way Google automatically scans Gmail messages and then advertises against them. ''In the same way that I write, 'I'm coming to see you in England,' and then I see airfare ads,'' Mr. Genauer said, ''you could see how someone could use metadata in video to sell products. If I watch a lot of kitty videos, you would sell me kitty products.'' Correction: April 4, 2014, Friday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about Amazon's new set-top box to stream video, games and other entertainment to customers' television sets misstated part of the company's content offerings. It offers several sports channels, not none. Amazon began selling its $99 Fire TV device immediately.

        "content": " Over the last 20 years, big technology companies like Google, Amazon and Apple have revolutionized the way people discover information, find new products and buy goods and services, like athletic socks and airline tickets. Yet they have barely made a dent in changing the way people actually pay for things. Instead, the cash and credit card ecosystem has remained the status quo, even as Silicon Valley behemoths have upended so many other everyday experiences. Most online transactions are still paid for using credit cards. ''Fundamentally, there's not been a lot of change in the way people have shopped and paid in the last 20 years,'' said John J. Donahoe, chief executive of eBay. And it is with good reason. ''Cash works great,'' said Jordan H. McKee, an analyst with the Yankee Group. ''Credit cards work great.'' New payment methods could start to gain traction soon, however. Some of the biggest technology companies are now making how they are paid a priority. Having a hand in how people exchange money, they are realizing, has huge potential to deliver profits -- and valuable data. At stake is not only billions of dollars in revenue, but also the ability to shape how people buy, sell and pay in the future. If there has been one success story of a big technology company changing the way we pay, it has been Mr. Donahoe's own company, PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002. Outside of credit cards, it is the most-used payment system on the web, with 110 million active accounts on pace to conduct more than $200 billion in transactions next year. The business generates more than $6 billion annually and is growing fast. And PayPal is racing to develop a mobile strategy allowing its technology to be used for in-store purchases. But Google, Amazon and others are trying to muscle onto PayPal's turf. Google and Amazon companies have developed PayPal competitors that already perform many of the same roles. Apple and Microsoft, for their part, have hundreds of millions of users who have given them credit card information for one service or another. Google has for the last three years been pushing Google Wallet as an alternative to PayPal. As with PayPal, users can link their credit cards and bank accounts with Wallet. When it comes time to pay for something on the web or on a mobile browser that accepts the service, users need only enter their Wallet user name and password, instead of a full credit card number, expiration date and security code. And as with PayPal, the goal of Wallet is to take out some of the friction from online commerce. Google may have a hard time getting many retailers to sign on. While companies like Toys ''R'' Us, Airbnb and Quiznos are accepting payments through Wallet, others -- especially big retailers that sell a range of goods -- are wary of signing on. ''There's a lot of retailers that are very hesitant to work with Google,'' said Mr. McKee, the Yankee Group analyst. ''Is Google going to turn whatever they can into competitive information? It's a red flag for a lot of merchants.'' For example, a company that uses Google Wallet might worry that in doing so, it could be turning over valuable data on customers' demographics and buying habits. ''Walmart holds on to their transaction data very closely,'' Mr. McKee said. ''But that's exactly what Google wants.'' Google declined to comment about Wallet. The company viewed by retailers with even more suspicion than Google is Amazon. Its product, Login and Pay with Amazon, is aimed not so much at the Walmart.coms of the world as it is at the parking garages, restaurants and florists for which Amazon is less of a competitor. ''We see the payments opportunity as enormous,'' said Tom Taylor, a vice president at Amazon who oversees its payment initiatives. ''We're not talking about strict online retail, we're talking about trillions of dollars.'' Yet while Login and Pay with Amazon has already signed up some marquee partners, like Gogo Inflight, Mr. Taylor acknowledges that Amazon's founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, has no reason to celebrate yet. ''He's probably a little disappointed that we haven't done a bit better,'' he said. Amazon, and others, will most likely have their chance. PayPal will face increased competition soon, and just as there are many credit card providers and many banks, so too are there likely to be several companies providing online digital wallets. ''There's room for many winners,'' Mr. Taylor said. The battle for the market is only just getting started. Only 10 percent of total commerce is done online. The rest still happens in the nonvirtual world. ''Mobile is blurring the lines between e-commerce and bricks and mortar,'' Mr. Donahoe of eBay said. ''That's going to completely change how people shop and pay.'' As smartphones enable users to take their digital wallets into brick-and-mortar locations, retailers and payment providers are reassessing how online money and in-store products might interact. Beyond just enabling e-commerce on the go, many smartphones offer in-store purchases with digital wallets like PayPal and Google Wallet, using near field communication, or N.F.C., technology. With the swipe of an Android phone, you can pay for diapers at CVS through Google Wallet. PayPal has N.F.C. capability, too, and it, Google and Amazon are at the start of an arms race, each rushing out new features, like loyalty programs, rewards and discounted fees, that they hope will differentiate their service. Waiting in the wings are companies like Apple, which has the most credit card accounts on file of any company, with more than 575 million. Microsoft has information on troves of such accounts through its Skype and Xbox Live products. And Facebook, with its social graph of more than a billion users, could potentially transform its Credits product, which lets users buy virtual goods and a small range of services on the site, into a formidable competitor, too. ''The market is still in such a nascent stage,'' Mr. McKee the analyst said. ''The foundation is still being laid.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",

        "name": "Where the Amazon Fire TV Fits Into the Living Room ",
        "content": " Amazon on Wednesday announced its very own streaming media box, the  Amazon Fire TV . It costs $99 and will stream Netflix, Amazon Instant (of course), Hulu Plus, Showtime Anytime, Crackle and Vimeo, and more to be named. This announcement, as you may imagine, has led some people to wonder: \u201cWho needs this device?\u201d More specifically, who needs this device if you already have an Internet-connected television, otherwise known as a smart TV? The answer is a little complicated, so let\u2019s start with the market potential. Numbers differ, but Forrester Research found that just 12 percent of the population of the United States has an Internet-connected television, and of those who have them, only about 70 percent have actually connected those televisions to the Internet. Just 8 percent have what they call an \u201cInternet-dedicated\u201d TV set-top box. \u201cWe definitely feel that all of those separate devices are kind of an interim step until these kinds of Internet-connected features become standard in either the television or your DVR or your Blu-Ray player or game console,\u201d said Jim Nail, an analyst at Forrester. Consumers are more likely to buy a streaming TV-set-top box like the Fire TV than they are to buy a new television to get Internet video features, he said. Over the last five years, many consumers have thrown out their old televisions and bought flat screens, but many of those purchases were made before \u201csmart\u201d capabilities were built into televisions, said Mr. Nail. \u201cSo you\u2019re asking them to throw out a thousand- or two-thousand-dollar investment and turn around and buy a new one,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of consumers are in the mood to do that in this economy, so a hundred-dollar box is a much better proposition.\u201d Also, most smart TV interfaces haven\u2019t  been very good . Samsung has been redesigning the interface on its smart TVs and has run a  series of ads   showing off its capabilities. But awareness of smart TV is still low, and televisions with Internet capabilities make up only about a third of the televisions manufacturers are now shipping \u2014 and they tend to sell at a premium. It could be several years before Internet-connected televisions mature into easier-to-use devices, and a few more years after that before they become standard in most homes. In the meantime, Amazon is making a clever short-term play: a stand-alone streaming media device at a time when consumer awareness of getting Internet material on a television is slowly starting to increase. In addition, they get people used to seeing Amazon when they turn on the television \u2014 which is often. That helps Amazon lead you into its vast e-commerce offerings. If you\u2019re used to using the company first for books, then holiday gifts, then toilet paper and fresh groceries, then streaming media and movies, you eventually get used to the idea of using Amazon for everything. \u201cPeople spend so much time with TV that now you\u2019ve got this big chunk of consumer attention, and there\u2019s a lot of different directions to take that,\u201d said Mr. Nail. Still, Amazon hardly has this market to itself: Apple TV is probably the primary competition, with name recognition to boot, although Google\u2019s Chromecast is, to me, the dark horse at just $35 and with a dead simple operation. Roku remains a competitor, and don\u2019t forget about game consoles: In 2013, the PlayStation 3 was the  No. 1   connected television platform for Netflix streaming , with the Xbox 360 not far behind. Amazon is promoting some gaming capabilities in the Fire TV, perhaps as a way to counter the consoles, which cost several hundred dollars more. But the Fire TV is an interesting move for Amazon. Tablets with Amazon media on them were a start, but taking over the living room is a bigger job. The Fire TV will either help propel streaming media into the mainstream or get crushed in the stampede of streaming media gadgets. I\u2019ll have a full review of the Fire TV in the next few days, so for now I\u2019ll just say: Stay tuned.

        "name": "Cloud Computing\u2019s Watershed Week ",
        "content": " It may be no accident that in the last week of the year\u2019s first quarter there were so many significant moves by big companies, particularly in giant systems of connected computers. Cloud computing and the Internet of Things, these moves suggest, are moving from their rough pioneering days to something bigger and more stable. To consider just a few of the biggest moves over the week: Google harmonized   its cloud computing business to a single entity, with a pricing model intended to hold customers by enticing them to build ever cheaper and more complex software. Cisco  announced   it would spend $1 billion on a kind of \u201ccloud of clouds\u201d project. Later in the week it was part of a  consortium   of big multinationals that will set engineering standards for wiring people, machines and computers together in large industrial settings. Microsoft\u2019s new chief executive made his first big public appearance,  offering   Office for the Apple iPad, partly as a way to sell more of its cloud-based Office 365 product. Intel  announced   a big investment of money and technology in Cloudera, a move that establishes a clear leader in the business of doing big data analysis in the cloud. At a user conference in San Francisco, Amazon Web Services announced the general release of its cloud-based  desktop computing business   , as well as a deal with  Infor   to offer cloud-based enterprise software tools to industries like healthcare and manufacturing. None of these were impulsive, breaking announcements. Rather, they were more like deals that were first hatched in late 2013 as strategic plays for the coming year. And, at the end of the start of 2014, the bets have been placed. Some of these, like the moves by Cisco, Microsoft and Intel, seem like efforts by incumbents to catch up with the times. (if that sounds like criticism, consider the alternative.) Others, like the announcements by Google and A.W.S., further develop cloud computing. The consortium deal tames its next step by establishing practices. What all of them do is admit that cloud computing soon will not be another business. It will be a part of almost every business, probably one that continues to grow. \u201cWhat is surprising to us is how long it took,\u201d said Adam Selipsky, vice president of marketing at A.W.S., the biggest company in cloud computing. \u201cThis is a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. We assumed from the beginning it was unlikely we\u2019d be the only participant.\u201d A.W.S. began in 2006, and already takes credit for enabling the creation of businesses like Airbnb, which is taking on the hotels business; Spotify, doing the same to music; Dropbox, a challenge to traditional data storage; and Pinterest, which disrupts things like tearing pages out of catalogs and sharing them. With most everyone on cloud computing, there should be more of that, from AWS and other cloud outfits. Established companies like Netflix, Kempinski Hotels, and the Australian bank Suncorp have or are in the process of primarily running their business on A.W.S. Charles E. Phillips, the head of Infor, said his company is \u201cessentially going all in\u201d on a cloud-based enterprise software strategy, changing its compensation to sales people and offering to take all of a customer\u2019s data over to A.W.S. from their existing computers for $55,000. \u201cFriends don\u2019t let friends build data centers anymore,\u201d he said. That\u2019s likely to become a common view, though companies like Cisco still back the idea that private computer centers will remain important for a long time. Mr. Selipsky saw the market changing from start-up curiosity to established practice in other ways. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge interest from educational institutions in teaching a cloud curriculum,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s demand in computer science and engineering departments in skills like building applications on inexpensive commodity hardware,\u201d with abilities to grow globally fast. That twinge some feel at times like this is akin to seeing the fences go up on the frontier, the record companies signing your favorite underground band, or the parents coming down to the basement party just when it was getting good. We may be past the wild part, but there\u2019s far more potential with this inevitable outcome. If you do feel that way, don\u2019t worry. This is also the week that Facebook made big investments in  virtual reality   and solar-powered  drones   that send high-speed data. A representative from Google gave a talk at the University of California, Berkeley, about Google\u2019s experiments in  quantum computing   that was cautiously optimistic, but not conclusive. Some  disagreed   . There\u2019s still plenty of frontier out there for everybody.

        "name": "The Tech Bubble\u2019s Silver Lining: Cheap Services for Everyone ",
        "content": " Box is losing money. A lot of money. In  documents it filed   for its initial public offering, the cloud-storage firm disclosed this week that it took in $124 million in 2013, but spent $257 million. Its losses have grown substantially over the last two years because the vast majority of its 25 million users don\u2019t pay anything for the company\u2019s services. Box has hired an army of sales and marketing people in an effort to convert some of its free users into paying customers. Still, the company says it does not expect to turn a profit \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d There are two ways to think about Box\u2019s finances. You could argue, as  many have , that the losses are proof we\u2019re in an incipient tech bubble. Box\u2019s I.P.O. is one of the most anticipated tech offerings of the year; it is widely seen as a precursor to a raft of offerings by other start-ups selling cloud services, including Dropbox. But if investors go gaga over a company that\u2019s losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year, doesn\u2019t it prove we\u2019re back to where we were in the late 1990s, with soaring valuations for companies that don\u2019t have a solid business future? Perhaps. But there\u2019s another, happier way to think about Box\u2019s numbers: Whether or not Box\u2019s business pans out, isn\u2019t it amazing that investors are financing a company that is giving away 25 million cloud-storage accounts for free? Box isn\u2019t alone in its apparent generosity. Thanks to the high hopes and deep pockets of tech investors, a host of high-profile tech firms are now offering incredible business and consumer services at impossibly low prices. The trend is playing out across a range of industries, including business I.T. services, communications, media, payments, local delivery and e-commerce. And because these start-ups are exerting pricing pressure on established market players, even customers who don\u2019t use their services might benefit from their rise. This is the silver lining of a tech bubble. If investors and acquirers keep throwing money into tech \u2014 at companies from Box to Dropbox to Square to Uber to WhatsApp to Postmates and more \u2014 we\u2019ll get more great products at low prices. We might even get services completely for free, even if it imperils the companies offering them. So as long as you don\u2019t make the mistake of investing in dubious tech dreams, you may be able to ride out the bubble to some pretty great swag. Why are these companies setting their prices so low? They aren\u2019t stupid, nor are they altruistic; they all want to make money someday. But many start-ups are in new kinds of businesses in which  growth is considered more   important than profit , at least in the short run. Box offers a telling example. The company  believes   it can be an important player in a cloud-services industry that will eventually be worth tens of billions of dollars. If that\u2019s the case, then grabbing as much of the market as possible now, before other players do, makes sense \u2014 even if doing so comes at a steep cost for the next few years. Box may or may not be right about this plan. But it doesn\u2019t have much choice about keeping its prices low, because every other player in the cloud-storage business is acting on the same profits-be-damned calculus. Dropbox, like Box, has also been  raising money at a rapid clip   to finance a wild expansion. Meanwhile, huge rivals like Google and Microsoft are also pushing into the market with eye-popping prices. Google recently slashed the price of its online storage  to $9.99 per month   for 1 terabyte of space, from $49.99 a month. The end result for consumers and businesses: Thanks to all these firms clawing for a foothold in a future megabusiness, we can all get boatloads of online storage for very little money. The price declines in cloud storage might look like a special case, because the underlying infrastructure in that business \u2014 data capacity on servers \u2014 is always getting cheaper. But we see similar price trends in other businesses being attacked by start-ups. Look at communications services.  As I wrote last month , Internet-based texting apps like WhatsApp have saved customers billions of dollars by providing a much cheaper alternative to carriers\u2019 exorbitant texting plans. WhatsApp\u2019s rise forced carriers to slash their S.M.S. fees. Now Facebook\u2019s acquisition of the firm is cementing those price cuts. Facebook has said it doesn\u2019t expect WhatsApp to make money until it has billions of users. That gives the company several years to figure out a business plan \u2014 several years in which users can expect to get nearly free texts, thanks to Facebook\u2019s largesse. Then there\u2019s local delivery. In New York and San Francisco, there are many new firms looking to deliver food and other items at extremely low cost. I\u2019ve become a fan of  Google\u2019s Shopping Express   same-day shopping service, which sends Googlers to local retailers to pick up items for you, at no charge. The service is so convenient I often order single items when I don\u2019t have time to go out. There\u2019s no way Google made a profit on my $3 baby shampoo order, or my $2.50 order of Hershey\u2019s chocolate syrup. But as long as Google has money to burn, and as long as it sees local delivery as an important business that it has to defend against the likes of Uber, Postmates, Instacart and Amazon \u2014 well, as long as all that, Google is going to be o.k. losing a bit on my chocolate syrup order. And that gets us to the granddaddy of profitless consumer friendliness, Amazon. For years, the e-commerce giant has made tiny profits, yet investors, expecting a future bonanza, constantly drive up the company\u2019s stock price. This is a fantastic state of affairs for consumers. Freed from the pressures of profits, Amazon is able to spend billions of dollars every year building huge warehouses that can ship us all our stuff in a couple days\u2019 time. It is sending armies of trucks into urban areas to deliver groceries. It\u2019s working on drones to ship you batteries.  As   Matthew Yglesias once wrote at Slate , \u201cAmazon, as best I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers.\u201d Sure, there are hidden costs to all this spending in search of future growth. The bubble is fueling dislocation and yawning inequality across the San Francisco Bay Area. My no-cost Google orders are probably environmentally taxing, though no more so than if I\u2019d run to the store for my chocolate syrup. And because lots of these start-ups are going to fail, you may be sorry if you choose the wrong one. You could lose your data, or your privacy, if your wrong choice tries to sell your data. These are all legitimate worries about the bubble. But it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that not all effects of the bubble are terrible. To the extent that tech companies are forgoing profits, it means they\u2019re doing other valuable things with their money \u2014 including offering cheaper services, investing in future innovations or hiring lots of people. Or all three. Google\u2019s Bigger, Cheaper  Cloud Did Big Internet Companies Handicap Start-Ups in FISA Rule  Changes?

        "content": " The chief executives of LinkedIn, Ford Motor Company , Northwestern Mutual , Goldman Sachs and Intuit were among the top scorers this year in  Glassdoor\u2019s ranking   of the leaders at 51 big companies. Yahoo and General Electric anchored the bottom of the list. Glassdoor is a jobs listing website that lets employees anonymously rate their bosses. Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn, a social network website, received a 100 percent favorability rating with the employees, and former employees, who responded. His leadership scored the top marks in ratings for senior management, work and life balance, culture and values, compensation and benefits and career benefits. Each company on the Glassdoor list had 1,000 or more employees. The comments were mostly measured, though there were a few zingers. Mr. Weiner, for example, won high marks, with one project manager noting that the company \u201cfosters productivity from a positive, fun exchange of ideas.\u201d But another, a former associate product manager, curtly noted that the company \u201cneeds innovation.\u201d In total, three of the top 10 executives on Glassdoor\u2019s ranking were from Silicon Valley. Brad Smith at the financial software maker Intuit was ranked No. 7, with a 94 percent approval rating, and Mark Zuckerberg , at Facebook , came in at No. 10, with a 93 percent rating. The number of technology leaders increases to four when counting Larry Page at Google , who came in No. 11. Jeff Bezos , at Amazon, in Seattle, was in the middle of the pack, at No. 33, with an 86 percent rating from his employees. Traditional industries claimed some of the top spots. Alan R. Mulally , at Ford Motor came in No. 2, and Richard W. Edelman, chief executive of the public relations giant Edelman, at No. 3. Each received a 97 percent approval rating from employees. John E. Schlifske at Northwestern Mutual and Craig Jelinek at Costco both received a 95 percent rating, along with Paul E. Jacobs , who led San Diego-based chip maker Qualcomm before Steven M. Mollenkopf took over this month. Even Wall Street bosses got some love. Lloyd C. Blankfein , who heads Goldman Sachs , came in at No. 8, with a 93 percent approval rating from his underlings. There were only two women on the list. Sharen Turney , at Victoria\u2019s Secret, was listed at No. 35, with an 85 percent rating. Marissa Mayer , at Yahoo , came in at No. 50 with a 79 percent rating, just above Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric , with 78 percent. One employee praised Yahoo for \u201cgenerous compensation for many and nice benefits, including free food,\u201d and the \u201cmany competent and driven people who want to get things done,\u201d but added there was \u201clots of red tape, difficulty dealing with proposals across properties.

        "name": "Cisco to Create a Bridge for Cloud-Computing Systems ",
        "content": " Even for the world of globe-spanning computer systems, Cisco is going big. On Monday Cisco Systems announced it would spend $1 billion on creation of an ''Intercloud,'' which promises to bridge multiple cloud-computing systems open to the public -- like those offered by Amazon Web Services and Google Compute Engine -- the private clouds of big companies and specialty cloud services for business. Cisco, the networking giant, is building out its own data centers for the system and says it will offer Intercloud clients a high level of security and reliability. It also hopes to enlist a dozen or so large telecommunications companies and services consulting companies as partners. Other money will go toward new technology and a specialized sales organization. The idea is to let companies run their software applications both internally and on public clouds, with close management, security and geographic control. What remains to be seen is whether there is really much demand for such a service. The goal is a ''Star Alliance'' of technology companies, said Nick Earle, senior vice president for cloud sales at Cisco. Star Alliance is a global network of 28 major airlines. So far, Cisco has announced only one partner, Australia's Telstra, but it will announce other partners in coming weeks, Mr. Earle said. They will include ''market makers, big ecosystems,'' like IBM in business applications, Accenture in services or Verizon in telecommunications. None of these companies were part of Monday's announcement. One reason for the move, Mr. Earle said, was the revelations of how much the National Security Agency was spying on just about everyone. Companies have said the N.S.A. news is changing policies around the movement of data over external networks. ''Thanks to the N.S.A., there are lots of countries that won't let their data out,'' he said. ''Thirty to 40 percent of the workloads on an A.W.S. are on personal credit cards that bypass the information technology department. With the N.S.A., this has to change.'' Another reason was the realization that companies like Amazon and Google were essentially running their own systems, while there was room for more interoperability and open standards. Cisco is building its Intercloud on OpenStack software, an open-source, cloud-computing standard. There are two ways to look at this. On the one hand, Cisco is trying to meet a real need, in the face of both growing public clouds and an anxiety inside information technology departments that companies are losing control of their own computer networks, either through N.S.A. types or unauthorized employees. On the other, Cisco and the other big incumbents it hopes to bring into its Intercloud may be making a play for relevance in a world that has evolved beyond the systems they built. What a Cisco (or for that matter, an Oracle, SAP, Verizon and others) has to offer in this future is primarily a strong relationship with the past. That is no small matter to companies that have to manage decades of data and applications. Whether this move is a rear-guard action or a forward-looking play, however, it's clear that cloud computing has become a very big money game.",

        "name": "In Two Settlements, Money for Apple and Amazon Customers ",
        "content": " Apple and Amazon customers were notified on Tuesday of opportunities to get money back as a result of two legal settlements with the government. Both cases revolved around Apple. Apple emailed customers eligible for a refund related to a federal complaint that children could make purchases in iPhone or iPad apps without adequate parental consent. In January, Apple reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to  pay at least $32.5 million in refunds . In another email, Amazon notified customers about store credit they received for e-book purchases, a result of a settlement reached with five major book publishers. In an  antitrust lawsuit   filed in 2012, the Justice Department had accused the publishers of conspiring with Apple to raise the average price of e-book titles. The publishers agreed to pay a total of $166 million. Customers who bought an e-book published by Simon & Schuster, Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan or Penguin from April 1, 2010, to May 21, 2012, are getting a credit of $3.17 for each book that was on the New York Times best-seller list; for books not on the list, customers get a credit of $0.73 per title. \u201cIllegal actions by these publishers forced consumers in New York and across the nation to pay artificially inflated prices for e-books,\u201d Eric T. Schneiderman, New York\u2019s attorney general, said in a statement. \u201cCompanies engaging in such anticompetitive conduct will be punished \u2014 and starting today, those injured by their actions will start to receive full and fair compensation.\u201d Apple chose to  fight the Justice Department last summer   in a Manhattan courtroom, and lost. But it continues to contest the decision by filing  appeals   and  pushing back against the lawyer   assigned to monitor its activities. For parents affected by unauthorized in-app purchases, Apple customers can  fill out a form online   to apply for a refund. For the e-books settlement, Amazon customers will automatically receive store credit.

        "name": "Google\u2019s Bigger, Cheaper Cloud ",
        "content": " Google\u2019s cloud computing business has figured out how it\u2019s going to come at Amazon Web Services: lower and simpler prices, predictable services and software innovation. Some of the price cuts are as much as 85 percent. Amazon is expected to soon respond with moves of its own. Over the long term, according to the executive in charge of Google\u2019s public cloud, Google wants software developers, both independent and within companies, to count on prices steadily dropping at a rate that roughly tracks Moore\u2019s Law. That means a doubling of power per dollar every 18 to 24 months. Google also wants its cloud business to move from a series of different services to a single, comprehensive product that handles familiar business applications, new apps, and big back-end data analysis and storage jobs. \u201cWe think if we win the hearts and minds of developers, good things happen,\u201d said Greg DeMichillie, director of management for Google\u2019s cloud business. \u201cSimplicity will be a big deal \u2013 what developers like to do is to write code, not managing infrastructure or worrying about resource planning.\u201d The  lower pricing   and the predictability are smart moves, strategically. While Amazon Web Services has marquee names like Netflix and Shell renting its  sophisticated computers   over the Internet to run businesses, there is a sense among many smaller companies that the Amazon service is a good place to get started, but it becomes expensive as a company gets bigger. For example, the business intelligence company GoodData was once an advocate of Amazon Web Services, but has moved most operations into its own cloud system. \u201cNo one should ever say it\u2019s cheaper to run this themselves,\u201d Mr. DeMichillie said. A reliable drop in prices could also make it easier for companies to plan the creation of new products and services. Amazon Web Services has often cut prices aggressively, but in something of a scattered way. At a Google event on Tuesday, Urs H\u00f6lzle, a Google senior vice president, said prices for Google Compute Engine, its cloud service for big workloads, would be cut 32 percent across the board. Prices for App Engine, its software application service, were simplified and fell about 30 percent. Data storage prices were cut 68 percent, in general, to 2.6 cents per gigabyte over various storage systems. BigQuery, a data analysis product, saw prices cut 85 percent. Prices would continue to fall roughly in line with Moore\u2019s Law, Mr. H\u00f6lzle said. That is actually an impressive vow; Moore\u2019s Law is an observation about semiconductor power, but Google, Amazon Web Services and others offer increasingly sophisticated software, as well as hardware. Google has internal methods of creating and deploying systems, Mr. DeMichillie said, that make it confident it can make good on the pricing vow. \u201cOur velocity can be made faster than the industry,\u201d he said. As to whether anyone in Google had qualms about exposing its crown jewels, he said, \u201cthere is a recognition throughout Google that cloud is the next big thing. There is no sense of \u2018No, not that.\u2019\u201d The announcement was made at a Google cloud event in San Francisco. On Wednesday, Amazon Web Services will have its own event in San Francisco and may respond to Google\u2019s moves with announcements of its own. Sustained users of Google\u2019s cloud, as opposed to intermittent purchasers, would receive discounts of up to 30 percent. In addition to the lower prices, Google added a couple of features, such as the ability for a software developer to rapidly look as source code, automatic updating of software that is in the process of completion, and minor code changes while viewing it with a browser, that can speed production of new software. Future product announcements this year, Mr. DeMichillie said, will involve \u201cbatch computing, opportunistic computing \u2013 where you get 100,000 computing cores for a brief period.\u201d  IBM and Amazon Web Services   have been involved in similar initiatives. Google is also allowing operating systems such as Suse, Red Hat Linux and Microsoft Windows Server to be used within its cloud. This is considered a minimum necessity for many established businesses. BigQuery is being modified to take in 100,000 data records per second, allowing for the fast analysis of large streams of data. The many developer-friendly improvements in Google\u2019s Cloud make somewhat conspicuous through absence what has long been a weak spot where Google\u2019s commercial side is concerned: While its geek-heavy culture speaks to developers, the company has had less success understanding and speaking to more conventional businesspeople. While now a $1 billion a year business, Google Apps for Business struggled for many years to make significant progress against Microsoft Office, despite being significantly cheaper. Mr. DeMichillie said that is changing too. \u201cWe are good and getting better,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we talk to executives. It\u2019s not like the start-ups were beating down our door to have Windows Server.\u201d The Cloud Era Begins for Enterprise  Tech Did Big Internet Companies Handicap Start-Ups in FISA Rule  Changes?

        "name": "Amazon sharply raises cost of premium service ",
        "content": " Amazon is gambling they care more about the first than the second. The retailer told the 25 million members of its Amazon Prime program on Thursday that it was increasing the annual fee for the two-day shipping service by 25 percent, to $99. The new price takes effect on the renewal dates for existing customers, starting April 17. Amazon is famous for squeezing its suppliers for a better deal. Working in one of its warehouses, according to numerous investigative reports, echoes \u2018\u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables.\u2019\u2019 But the company is extremely solicitous of its customers, and takes care not to undermine their view that the retailer is at their service. That is why Amazon held the line on Prime for the first nine years of its existence. What consumers want to know, however, is what a retailer is doing for them right now. After the fee increase was announced, the notion of a benevolent Amazon took a beating on the retailer\u2019s discussion forums. \u2018\u2018I have been a Prime member for many years and will not be bullied into paying more!!!\u2019\u2019 wrote one overwrought fellow. \u2018\u2018This is RIDICULOUS!!!!!\u2019\u2019 Others more coolly pointed out that they were now paying tax on their Amazon purchases as well as on the Prime fee itself. They said they did not watch the 40,000 movies and TV shows that came bundled with Prime membership. And they said the two-day shipping sometimes ended up taking more time, and in that case why not use the standard shipping option \u2014 completely free for those who hit a $35 minimum? \u2018\u2018It was fun while it lasted,\u2019\u2019 another soon-to-be-former user concluded. Investors, however, applauded the news. On a day when markets fell sharply, shares in Amazon held steady. Wall Street clearly believes Amazon can improve its shipping margins, helping the fragile bottom line without letting the revenue miss a step. Maybe not, said Hayley Silver of Bizrate Insights, an e-commerce consultant. \u2018\u2018Raising prices in retail is a really hard thing to do,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018This fee increase makes Amazon a little more vulnerable. But whether any competitor can step up to the plate is another story.\u2019\u2019 At least one competitor quickly moved to secure some Amazon customers. ShopRunner, a network of retailers from Neiman Marcus to PetSmart that offers two-day shipping, said it would waive its fees for Amazon Prime members for a year. ShopRunner usually costs $79. \u2018\u2018People are a little upset with Amazon,\u2019\u2019 said Fiona Dias, ShopRunner\u2019s chief strategy officer. \u2018\u2018We hope a lot upset.\u2019\u2019 Amazon blamed rising costs of fuel and transportation for the increase in the Prime fee, but Ms. Dias said the real problem was the cost to Amazon of all the content that it includes with Prime membership. Amazon has now moved into original programming, part of its continuing competition with Netflix. \u2018\u2018Amazon is passing on the cost of video to a bunch of people addicted to buying online,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Dias said. \u2018\u2018Maybe it sticks in their craw that they\u2019re now being asked to pay more for stuff they don\u2019t want.\u2019\u2019 Prime members also get to borrow one free e-book a month, but only if they have a Kindle. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment. Amazon is a mega-retailer, soon to hit $100 billion in revenue with 237 million active customers. It has completely reworked people\u2019s experience with books, and is trying to do the same with other forms of entertainment.

        "content": " SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 People like getting their toys fast. They also like getting them cheap. Amazon is gambling they care more about the first than the second. The retailer told the 25 million members of its Amazon Prime program on Thursday that it was increasing the annual fee for the two-day shipping service by 25 percent, to $99. The new price takes effect on the renewal dates for existing customers, starting April 17. Amazon is famous for squeezing its suppliers for a better deal. Working in one of its warehouses, according to numerous  investigative reports , echoes \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables.\u201d But the company is extremely solicitous of its customers, and takes care not to undermine their view that the retailer is at their service. That is why Amazon held the line on Prime for the first nine years of its existence. What consumers want to know, however, is what a retailer is doing for them right now. After the fee increase was announced, the notion of a benevolent Amazon took a beating on the retailer\u2019s discussion forums. \u201cI have been a Prime member for many years and will not be bullied into paying more!!!\u201d  wrote one overwrought   fellow . \u201cThis is RIDICULOUS!!!!!\u201d Others more coolly pointed out that they were now paying tax on their Amazon purchases as well as on the Prime fee itself. They said they did not watch the 40,000 movies and TV shows that came bundled with Prime membership. And they said the two-day shipping sometimes ended up taking more time, and in that case why not use the standard shipping option \u2014 completely free for those who hit a $35 minimum? \u201cIt was fun while it lasted,\u201d another soon-to-be-former user concluded. Investors, however, applauded the news. On a day when markets fell sharply, shares in Amazon held steady. Wall Street clearly believes Amazon can improve its shipping margins, helping the fragile bottom line without letting the revenue miss a step. Maybe not, said Hayley Silver of Bizrate Insights, an e-commerce consultant. \u201cRaising prices in retail is a really hard thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThis fee increase makes Amazon a little more vulnerable. But whether any competitor can step up to the plate is another story.\u201d At least one competitor quickly moved to secure some Amazon customers. ShopRunner, a network of retailers from Neiman Marcus to PetSmart that offers two-day shipping,  said it would waive its fees   for Amazon Prime members for a year. ShopRunner usually costs $79. \u201cPeople are a little upset with Amazon,\u201d said Fiona Dias, ShopRunner\u2019s chief strategy officer. \u201cWe hope a lot upset.\u201d Amazon blamed rising costs of fuel and transportation for the increase in the Prime fee, but Ms. Dias said the real problem was the cost to Amazon of all the content that it includes with Prime membership. Amazon has now moved into original programming, part of its continuing competition with Netflix. \u201cAmazon is passing on the cost of video to a bunch of people addicted to buying online,\u201d Ms. Dias said. \u201cMaybe it sticks in their craw that they\u2019re now being asked to pay more for stuff they don\u2019t want.\u201d Prime members also get to borrow one free e-book a month from a lending library, but only if they have a Kindle. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment. Amazon is a mega-retailer, soon to hit $100 billion in revenue with 237 million active customers. It has completely reworked people\u2019s experience with books, and is trying to do the same with other forms of entertainment. Land-based competitors from Sears to Staples are culling stores in a way they would not if Amazon did not exist. The company\u2019s ambition is boundless. Yet it is never clear how solid its achievement is. Amazon might have rewritten many of the rules for retail but at the end of the day it will still have to make a profit while pleasing customers. It certainly does the latter, but tends to skimp on the former. \u201cThis is a rational business move but atypical, because they usually seem to hate raising prices until necessary,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, a Forrester Research analyst. \u201cI suspect the people they lose will be offset by some people paying more, some more wallet share in categories like grocery and a bunch of people forgetting to cancel.\u201d Ms. Mulpuru added, \u201cAmazon is trying to figure out how to better manage shipping costs and it is coming at the expense of service.\u201d She, like some of those on the Amazon forum, complained of slow Prime shipping. Amazon, which said in January it was considering raising the fee for Prime by as much as 50 percent, does not release any data it does not have to, so analyst estimates that there are 25 million Prime members are only a reasonable guess. Some are trial members or students, who pay much less. Analysts at Piper Jaffray surveyed 500 current Prime subscribers in the United States, asking them how likely they would be to renew if the fee went to $109. Two-thirds said no, but the analysts did not believe them. \u201cPsychologically no one wants to pay more for something,\u201d wrote Gene Munster, one of the analysts, in a Thursday report.

        "content": " BERLIN -- For Linio, think Amazon for Mexicans. For Zalora, think Zappos for Malaysians. For Easy Taxi, think Uber for Nigerians. And for all of them, think Rocket Internet, a budding tech empire here in Germany's capital. From its low-key offices near the center of the city, Rocket Internet has turned the usual business model for technology companies on its head, compiling a team of high-flying finance and management specialists and arming them with the money they need to mimic already successful Internet companies -- applying these proven ideas in other countries, often in emerging markets. Since starting in 2007, Rocket has backed about 75 start-ups in more than 50 countries that now generate more than $3 billion in annual revenue and employ about 25,000 people. The business model stands in sharp contrast with the ethos that dominates Silicon Valley, where originality is perceived as the main currency for successful start-ups. It also has raised questions over whether Europe's tech sector, where Rocket is a major player, can ever foster the same level of innovation that has led to a conveyor belt of successful American tech giants like Oracle, Google and Facebook. Still, Rocket Internet balks at criticism that it is purely a copycat machine. It says all successful business ideas are somewhat borrowed from others, and the ability to take proven tech ideas to emerging markets is a skill unto itself. The small tech start-ups that Rocket supports are often given as little as six months to succeed or face being shut down. ''If there's a clear business model that is proven to work, we will look at it,'' said Oliver Samwer, 41, one of three brothers who started Rocket Internet, and who travels almost constantly to visit the company's global portfolio of tech start-ups. ''Every new company is like a speedboat, and we want them to become aircraft carriers.'' Within the global tech community, Rocket Internet and the start-ups it incubates are known for aggressively expanding into new markets and squeezing out local rivals. Zalando, a German copy of the American e-commerce firm Zappos, has spread to 15 European countries since starting in 2008 and reported a 52 percent rise in its sales, to $2.4 billion, last year. Rocket Internet recently sold its remaining stake in Zalando, which is valued at around $5 billion, to the Swedish investment company Kinnevik, one of Rocket's main investors, though the Samwer brothers retain a stake through their own investment firm. Other Rocket-backed e-commerce start-ups, including the Latin American e-commerce site Dafiti and its Russian counterpart Lamoda, also have secured large market shares in some of the world's fastest-growing developing economies. To succeed, they have had to tweak their business models for emerging markets. That involves offering cash-on-delivery services where few consumers have credit cards and running large fleets of delivery trucks where local logistics and infrastructure remain basic. The rapid expansion has fueled speculation that some of the tech firms could either be bought by larger United States rivals that want to expand globally or potentially become public companies through multibillion-dollar initial public offerings. ''Rocket has disrupted the entire venture capital industry,'' said Christophe F. Maire, a leading Berlin-based investor who has backed several of the city's best-known start-ups, though none from Rocket Internet. ''It has groomed a lot of people in the art of going international.'' But the success has also raised questions about the value of a company that essentially depends on the ideas of others. Although the Rocket-supported companies are free to copy existing tech businesses as long as they do not infringe on copyrights and trademarks, there is nothing to stop competitors from rising up and pursuing the same strategy. And some companies have already popped up to parrot Rocket's business model. While the company has created a growing stable of global e-commerce start-ups, it has had less success with other Internet businesses. The company's version of Pinterest, for example, which allows people to share photographs and other media, has so far failed to win over many consumers. And after Airbnb held talks in 2011 about acquiring Rocket's Berlin-based copy, the American short-term housing website eventually decided to beef up its own international operations instead of buying the smaller rival. Others in the tech industry question whether Rocket Internet can maintain its success rate, as start-ups from Silicon Valley to Singapore look to expand globally as quickly as possible. That could cut the time Rocket Internet has to replicate successful tech ideas in emerging economies and other non-American markets. ''Just copying what the Americans have done is no longer a sustainable model,'' said Simon Cook, chief executive of the European venture firm DFJ Espirit. So far, though, no one has found the kind of success that Rocket has. ''We don't worry if someone else has launched a similar business model before,'' said Mr. Samwer, who receives monthly updates on the company's start-ups during a marathon 20-hour conference call where each business leader is allotted just 30 minutes of Mr. Samwer's time. ''The Internet moves at Formula One speed; execution is the most important component of a successful business.'' The track record of the Samwer brothers behind the company -- Oliver, Marc and Alexander -- dates to the first dot-com boom when they sold Alando, a German version of eBay, to its larger American rival for $50 million. The entrepreneurs, who were in their mid-20s, built and sold the start-up in less than 100 days. After the eBay deal, they used some of the proceeds to start Jamba, a mobile phone services company that produced the Crazy Frog ringtone, which they sold to the American tech company Verisign for $270 million in 2004. The three German brothers also have bought and sold stakes over the years in a number of high-profile American start-ups, including Facebook, Groupon and Zynga, which have gone on to become global household names. Now, they focus their attention on building start-ups around the world. And the formula is relatively simple. Typically, Rocket's core team finds the ideas (on a few occasions, outsides have brought them business plans), then brings in entrepreneurs to run the businesses. The Samwer brothers give M.B.A. graduates and former banking traders -- often from companies like Goldman Sachs and McKinsey -- as much as $20 million in early-stage investment. They are then dispatched to distant places like Moscow and Jakarta, Indonesia, where American rivals have yet to establish a strong foothold. Along with borrowing ideas from some of the world's largest and most established e-commerce Internet companies, the company's entrepreneurs also have emulated younger businesses like Square, the mobile-payments company founded by Jack Dorsey, the chairman of Twitter. The pressure is intense on the start-up managers, who are usually paid a salary and do not receive a major stake in the company they operate. Several current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to harm their future career opportunities, remember high-pressured arguments when financial targets were not met and late-night calls from senior managers ordering them back to the office. But Ralf Wenzel and his company are evidence that the method works. As the co-founder of FoodPanda, an online takeout delivery service for restaurants that mirrors the popular American company GrubHub, Mr. Wenzel juggles a 650-person team spread across more than 40 countries. Large flat-screen televisions throughout the open-plan office keep the staff of FoodPanda, which was founded in 2012 and has raised almost $50 million in venture capital, on top of food deliveries ranging from sushi orders in Moscow to takeout burgers in Hanoi, Vietnam. ''We're a global, not European, company,'' said Mr. Wenzel, 35, who spends roughly 80 percent of his time traveling between the company's international offices. ''Getting to these new markets quickly gives us a huge competitive advantage.'' Pinterest, which allows people to share photographs and other media, left, is mimicked by Pinspire, above, from Rocket Internet. Pinspire has so far failed to win over many consumers.",

        "content": " Netflix on Tuesday released a satirical video promising ''Drone to Home'' delivery of DVDs to customers, taking an obvious swipe at Amazon's plan to deliver items to consumers via small octocopters, a.k.a. drones. The Netflix video quickly bounded across the Internet, passed along on Twitter and Facebook. Barely a minute long, the video purports to show a Netflix warehouse with cute little copters flying off carrying the distinctive red Netflix DVD envelopes. ''Unlike other companies trying to rush unproven technology to market, we have literally spent days working out most of the bugs,'' the narrator says, as one woman tries to run away from a drone following her, and another explodes in the background. Even when the DVDs are delivered successfully, the delivery is a little too all-knowing -- through the open sunroof of a car, to a person camping, even to a man standing at a urinal. Netflix has lately had fun taking jabs at rivals, including HBO and now Amazon, whose Prime Instant Video streaming service is competing for viewers who watch TV and movies online. In Air Prime, the name for Amazon's drone delivery plan, Netflix has an easy target -- the idea is widely parodied online, with one popular version from the Taiwanese animators who make a living riffing on the news. Close observers of the tech world took note of an ad in January for Amazon Prime, which includes free two-day shipping and video streaming, that referred indirectly to Netflix, saying, ''Who needs to subscribe to another video service? You get video, great movies right there on-demand as part of Prime.'' The Amazon plan came to light on ''60 Minutes'' in a rare interview with the company's founder, Jeff Bezos, who took the reporter Charlie Rose to a secret room where the drones were being tested. In the interview, which promoted the speed and applicability of drones to do many of the deliveries Amazon makes, Mr. Bezos alluded to the need to get everything right. ''Look, this thing can't land on someone's head while they are walking around -- that's not good.''",

        "name": "Questions Abound, but India Sees Room to Grow in E-Commerce ",
        "content": " BANGALORE -- Snapdeal and Flipkart, India's two largest online marketplaces, are frequently recipients of honorific, hopeful nicknames. They are, respectively, called the eBay and Amazon of India. But lately, Kunal Bahl, the young chief executive of Snapdeal, has been drawing parallels with another e-commerce juggernaut, Alibaba of China. India lags well behind China in e-commerce shoppers; incomes, credit card use and Internet penetration are lower as well. But the Indian e-commerce market has headroom, and its leaders are trying to convince the global finance world that Alibaba's success can be replicated in India. Mr. Bahl, 30, recently toured Silicon Valley, where the New Delhi-based company is said to be seeking $100 million in investment to give it a valuation of $750 million to $1 billion. Eight years ago, Mr. Bahl, a graduate of the Wharton business school, was settling into corporate life in the United States, first with Deloitte, then Microsoft. But in 2007, his visa renewal was rejected, forcing him to return to India. ''It was a blessing in disguise,'' he said in a recent interview in Bangalore. After starting Snapdeal, the baby-faced entrepreneur became a poster boy for the faults of American visa policy, landing at the center of an 2011 USA Today article on the technology brain drain in the United States. At that time, Snapdeal had about 400 employees. Now, its staff of 1,300 coordinates deliveries to about 4,000 towns and cities in India. The company, incorporated as Jasper Infotech, has altered its shape along the way. When Mr. Bahl started his company with Rohit Bansal, a high school friend, the pair focused on online coupons, a model similar to Groupon's. They tried other iterations of deals and discount cards, with little momentum. ''For the first two years or so, we were struggling,'' Mr. Bahl recalled. On Feb. 4, 2010, Snapdeal.com began operations primarily as a website for restaurant discounts. A year later, the company received its first significant investment, from Nexus Venture Partners, and morphed into its current form, a marketplace for Indian sellers and buyers to find one another. Today, it lists goods from about 20,000 merchants in a variety of categories and has about 20 million registered users. Mr. Bahl, whose father ran a small automotive parts business, casts Snapdeal as a champion of tiny enterprises in the country. ''Irrespective of who you may be, you have a level playing field against anyone in the market,'' he said. Estimates of the size of this market vary. The brokerage firm CLSA suggests Indian e-commerce will expand to $22 billion, from $3.1 billion, in five years. Flipkart, a Bangalore company that sells books, clothes and electronics online, predicts a market of $70 billion by 2020. As the projections have grown rosier, technology investors have poured in funds. In a May 2013 report, Allegro Advisors, an investment bank, said 53 e-commerce companies in India had secured $853 million in venture capital funds in the previous three years. But now, financing is slowing and several online retailers are shutting down. Analysts say the industry is consolidating, with the victors emerging. ''The e-commerce landscape in India is becoming clearer,'' said Deepak Srinath, an Allegro partner. ''It's a two-horse race; it's Snapdeal and Flipkart.'' Flipkart has netted about $540 million in funding since it began in 2007, including a $160 million investment in October. (In November 2012, a government agency began investigating whether Flipkart, which had received venture funds from American firms, had violated foreign investment laws.) Flipkart previously sold to consumers from an affiliated seller, WS Retail, before turning into a full merchant marketplace in April. So far, its marketplace has 1,000 sellers and 14 million registered users, well below Snapdeal's totals. For the past fiscal year, which ended in March 2013, Flipkart posted revenues of $190 million. Mr. Srinath says Flipkart is leading in name recognition -- a crucial category in India, where brand and service matter immensely. When Motorola introduced its newest phone in India, on Feb. 6, it chose Flipkart as its exclusive vendor for early sales. ''It's almost like e-commerce is synonymous with Flipkart,'' Mr. Srinath said. Mr. Bahl's company is now compared most often with eBay, which led a $50 million round of strategic funding in Snapdeal in June. Since 2011, the company has raised more than $200 million from investors, including Intel Capital and Nexus Venture Partners. Mr. Bahl said Snapdeal planned to go public but would not specify a date. In an interview with VentureBeat, he said he was planning an initial public offering in the United States. An I.P.O. would come after the company reached $1 billion in sales, he told India Ink. ''We'll be there in a matter of months,'' he said. Likewise, Flipkart has broadcast its desire to file an I.P.O., although it has no ''fixed timelines,'' a company spokeswoman in India said in an email. The company expects to hit $1 billion in sales by 2015. The two firms may be racing to go public for an unspoken reason. One technology industry adviser suggests that India's online shopping potential is being oversold, saying that e-commerce firms may be increasing their sales but are not adding new users as quickly as they claim. To warrant a large valuation, either company would need to mimic Alibaba's spectacular success and quickly reach 100 million Indian shoppers. This is unlikely, said the adviser, who asked for anonymity because his data on the companies was not public. If that truth surfaces with one I.P.O., a second would fetch much less interest, he said. In short, India won't produce an Alibaba, let alone two. Until either company goes public, parsing their financial data is very difficult, said Aditya Rath, an associate director at PricewaterhouseCoopers India. ''I would not be overly enthusiastic about sales,'' he cautioned. For Snapdeal, he added, a bigger question lingers: ''When are they going to meet their investment targets?'' Snapdeal has set ambitious goals before. In a 2010 interview, Mr. Bahl pledged that the company would soon be expanding to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Singapore. Those plans were shelved; the company is focused solely on India now. At the moment, India's surviving online retailers are sheltered from competition abroad, thanks to the government. In September 2012, India's cabinet opened its retail sector to foreign direct investment but excluded e-commerce. Amazon, which entered India in June, spent some of its lobbying funds in the United States on issues related to India's foreign direct investment laws, according to the company's latest disclosure. Industry experts do not expect the law to change soon, particularly not before the May elections. But Amazon isn't holding back. On Feb. 5, the company added luggage, video games and music to its product list in India. The list now encompasses 900,000 items, excluding books, and it has 2,300 sellers in India. It is working with the postal service to ship to remote areas and has started same-day delivery in six Indian cities. In its latest earnings report, Amazon posted $74.5 billion in global sales in 2013, with a market capitalization more than twice that -- dwarfing both Flipkart and Snapdeal. Still, analysts noted that Indian companies would not necessarily be plowed under if foreign e-commerce arrived in full force. India's market is diverse and complex, traits that give local companies a leg up. A total of 65 percent of Snapdeal's customers pay in cash; other companies see even higher rates. And India's poor roads and highways make logistics difficult. Mr. Bahl insisted that Snapdeal, as it grew and shape-shifted, had adapted enough to the peculiarities of India to handle competition. When asked about his better-funded rivals, Mr. Bahl offered a boastful verdict on his industry. ''It's not about the money that you have in the bank; it's how you spend it,'' he said. ''This is a game of execution. India's not an easy market to execute in.'' Mark Bergen is a freelance journalist based in Bangalore. Follow him on Twitter @mhbergen.

        "content": " Christopher North, Amazon\u2019s top executive in Britain, might soon be able to buy toiletries that carry his name. An independent cosmetics company called Lush that has been locked in a three-year legal battle with Amazon has just taken out a trademark for \u2018\u2018Christopher North\u2019\u2019 and created a shower gel with the tagline: \u2018\u2018rich, thick and full of it.\u2019\u2019 Lush is trying to make a point in its legal dispute, in which the company contends that Amazon is infringing on its trademark by using the word \u2018\u2018lush\u2019\u2019 to direct customers to rival cosmetic products on its site. This past week a British court ruled in Lush\u2019s favor. Lush says its does not sell its products on Amazon, because it strongly disagrees with the company\u2019s tax practices. Amazon has been criticized for minimizing its taxes in Britain by routing sales to British customers through Luxembourg. In ruling for Lush on Monday, Judge John Baldwin of the High Court said the right of the public to benefit from retail technologies did \u2018\u2018not go so far as to allow a trader such as Amazon to ride roughshod over intellectual property rights.\u2019\u2019 Amazon plans to appeal the decision, a spokesman, Ben Howes, said Friday.Mr. North, meanwhile, is said to be \u2018\u2018hopping mad\u2019\u2019 about his namesake shower gel, his lawyers were quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper. Mark and Mo Constantine, who founded Lush in 1995, said they had tried to resolve the issue amicably. \u2018\u2018We asked them 17 times before we went to court,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Constantine told The Guardian. Lush brought the case after Amazon bid on keywords containing \u2018\u2018lush\u2019\u2019 within Google\u2019s AdWords service as a way to drive traffic to the Amazon site. The Constantines said that the Christopher North shower gel had not actually gone on sale. But now that Amazon is fighting the court ruling, they say, they are no longer ruling out a range that might include deodorant and leg wax. And in case Amazon was considering a counterattack, Mr. Constantine has reportedly bought the trademark to his own name.",

        "content": " Five years ago, when the nation\u2019s largest chain of bookstores released an e-reader that it promised would best Amazon\u2019s Kindle, could you blame the poor souls who bought in to Barnes & Noble\u2019s vision of the future? In 2011, Consumer Reports proclaimed the Nook the  best e-reader in the land , saying it surpassed the Kindle in just about every way. Well, that sounds pretty definitive, doesn\u2019t it? No wonder your aunt bought you one for Christmas. Things haven\u2019t played out well since. After failing to douse Amazon\u2019s Kindle, Barnes & Noble has spent the last year refashioning its Nook strategy, and with  its recent reductions   in e-reader staff, the Nook\u2019s end looks nigh. If you own a Nook, the fate of your books may now be up in the air. Sorry, you bet on the wrong horse. The Nook\u2019s fate isn\u2019t unusual these days. Technologies have always gone belly up, but tech extinctions may become even more common over the next few years. We\u2019re living through an exhilarating and mystifying time in the tech business, when every established brand and business model \u2014 from the Windows PC to the whole idea of selling software and hardware for a profit \u2014  is suddenly under assault . Today, five behemoths \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 plus a dizzying array of start-ups are competing to win every dollar and minute you spend in tech. While each of these companies offers differing sets of technologies sold under widely varying business models, they all share a common feature \u2014 trying to hook you deeply into an ecosystem of interconnected technologies. The trouble arises when you are sold on a tech ecosystem that doesn\u2019t prosper. It\u2019s likely that at least one, if not several, of today\u2019s tech behemoths won\u2019t be around a decade from now. Thus the pervasive worry of choosing tech in these uncertain days: How do you avoid betting on the wrong horse? There is hope. By following a simple strategy, you can get the most out of the digital world while reducing the chance you\u2019ll be burned by a single wrong move. The point is to minimize the danger of getting locked in to any one company\u2019s ecosystem. The strategy also ensures that you can easily move from device to device without much hassle. The key is promiscuity. When you decide what to use, you\u2019ve got to play every tech giant against the other, to make every tech decision as if you were a cad \u2014 sample every firm\u2019s best features and never overcommit to any one. This sounds difficult. It isn\u2019t. Here\u2019s the game plan: BUY APPLE\u2019S HARDWARE Apple\u2019s phones, tablets and PCs are the best-designed and best-made computers on the market. They are also the easiest to learn to use and the most durable. And if you\u2019re kind to them, they\u2019ll  carry a far higher resale value   than rival devices. I say this after having tried just about every competitor to Apple\u2019s machines. Some non-Apple phones and tablets are nearly as nice as the iPhone and iPad (Google\u2019s Nexus line is quite good), but I haven\u2019t found any that beat it, and none that are as pleasurable to use. But the best thing about Apple\u2019s hardware is that it maximizes your ability to be promiscuous with software. Apple\u2019s App Store is home to more programs than any other app marketplace. What\u2019s more, the most innovative start-up firms often create apps for Apple\u2019s platform  before they bother with Android . Since software is the soul of a machine, the source of all our devices\u2019 advancing powers, you\u2019re best off getting the gadgets that can run the widest range of software. (A note for the sticklers: Yes, Apple restricts the ways you can tinker with the deeper parts of your mobile devices. But if you\u2019re a tinkerer, you don\u2019t need to read a column to decide what to buy.) USE GOOGLE\u2019S SERVICES. My phone and tablet carry Apple\u2019s logo, but almost everything I do with them is routed through the search company\u2019s servers. There\u2019s Google\u2019s Gmail app for email, Google\u2019s Calendar to manage your day, Google Maps to tell you where to go, Chrome to browse the Web and even the otherwise useless Google Plus social network  to back up your photos . Throwing your data at Google is a good idea for two reasons: First, the company is incredibly good at managing it; it lets you have access to stuff on pretty much any device, anywhere in the world, all the time. Its services almost never go down, its data is extremely accurate (see Maps), and, barring  intrusion by the N.S.A. , Google offers solid security (like  two-factor authentication ). I also love the handy tricks Google adds as it learns more and more about me (yes, I\u2019m aware I sound like a P.O.W. praising my jailers \u2014 but count my blinks, it\u2019s true). For instance, its Google Now feature, available as part of the Google Search app on the iPhone, can automatically predict what you are doing next and show you relevant information like traffic directions and boarding passes just when you need it. It even automatically enhances your photos, making your pretty face even prettier. Wait a second, though \u2014 aren\u2019t you committing to Google by giving it all your stuff? Nope, because here\u2019s the best thing: Unlike many of its rivals,  Google allows you to download your personal data   from  most of its services   so you can easily move to some other pusher. BUY MEDIA FROM AMAZON. This one is a no-brainer. If you\u2019re looking to buy a movie on your Windows laptop today, shouldn\u2019t you get one that will also work on an Android tablet you buy tomorrow? If you buy a book to read on your iPad, shouldn\u2019t you also make sure it works on the Kindle you\u2019re planning to get for Christmas? Different media providers offer different levels of such interoperability, but books, music and movies from Amazon are the most widely viewable. You can watch and read Amazon\u2019s media on Apple devices, Google devices, Amazon\u2019s own Kindle line and lots of other places, like cheap streaming devices for your TV. In contrast, a book from Apple\u2019s iBookstore is probably never going to work on an Android phone, because Apple really doesn\u2019t want you to buy an Android phone. So why bother with iBooks? BET ON CONNECTORS. In our multidevice world, Amazon\u2019s media store functions as what I like to call a \u201cconnector\u201d \u2014 it bridges the chasm between otherwise foreign technologies. This gets to the most important principle for dealing with an uncertain future: Invest your time and money in connectors. For instance, store all your important documents on the cloud-storage service  Dropbox , because its business model depends on it working everywhere. And it does: The documents you create on any single machine are replicated on all your other machines, instantly. Similarly, when someone hands you a business card, you can snap a photo of it on the note-taking app  Evernote , which also functions as a connector, letting you get at your scribbles regardless of which machine you move to next. And in a cloudy future, who knows what that could be?

        "name": "Penguin Withdraws Book by American Scholar of Hinduism to Settle Lawsuit ",
        "content": " BANGALORE \u2014 Penguin Books India, a unit of Penguin Random House , has agreed to withdraw and destroy all copies of a 2009 book on Hinduism by an American scholar to settle a lawsuit by a Hindu nationalist group that had objected to the book\u2019s portrayal of the religion. In a copy of the out-of-court settlement dated Feb. 4, which has been  widely circulating online   , Penguin Books India said it would complete the withdrawal of \u201cThe Hindus: An Alternative History,\u201d by Wendy Doniger, a University of Chicago religion professor, within six months. The lawsuit had been filed by Dina Nath Batra, the head of Shiksha Bacho Andolan, a Hindu educational organization in New Delhi, in 2011. Prior to the lawsuit, he filed  a notice   to Ms. Doniger and Penguin Group USA , then the parent of Penguin Books India, in 2010, saying that Ms. Doniger\u2019s book \u201chas hurt the religious feelings of millions of Hindus\u201d and therefore breached section 295A of the Indian Penal Code. The book, which was released in the United States and India in 2009, offended Hindus because of its \u201ctendency to over-eroticize\u201d the religion, said Ashok Malik, a journalist who reviewed \u201cThe Hindus\u201d when it first came out. \u201cI thought it was overdone.\u201d However, he did not support Penguin Books India\u2019s decision to withdraw the book. \u201cWhy did Penguin go for an out-of-court settlement? They could have waited for a judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is part of a larger trend where publishers keep away from controversial topics.\u201d In a  New York Times book review   , the author Pankaj Mishra called the book \u201ca salutary antidote to the fanatics who perceive \u2014 correctly \u2014 the fluid existential identities and commodious metaphysic of practiced Indian religions as a threat to their project of a culturally homogenous and militant nation-state.\u201d Mr. Batra said in an interview Tuesday that Shiksha Bachao Andolan would continue to battle books that hurt religious sentiment, and Madan Mohan Sharma, a member of Bharatiya Shiksha, a sister organization, said the group felt vindicated by Penguin Books India\u2019s decision. In an email to India Ink, Ms. Doniger said that she was \u201cangry and disappointed, and deeply concerned for freedom of speech in India.\u201d Penguin India did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The book is not banned in India, and it is still available as an e-book on Amazon. \u201cIf a smaller publisher wants to get the rights transferred and publish it, they could,\u201d said Nilanjana S. Roy, an author who is also a New York Times op-ed contributor. \u201cBut most publishers would not want this. Going to the courts is not what a publisher wants to do.\u201d Ms. Doniger\u2019s scholarly work has drawn opposition from Hindu groups in India and overseas. During a lecture in London in 2003, Ms. Doniger was almost hit by an egg thrown by a Hindu nationalist who was angry at the \u201csexual thrust\u201d of her interpretation of the \u201csacred\u201d \u201cRamayana,\u201d Mr. Mishra wrote in his book review. In 2010,  an online petition   started by the Sarasvati Research Trust, an educational institution based in New Delhi, demanded that Penguin Group USA withdraw the book from India. Ms. Roy said Penguin Books India\u2019s settlement sets a bad example. \u201cThere will be more people who would put pressure on the publishers, and they would not have the resources or the time to stand up for each of their books,\u201d she said. Last month, Bloomsbury India withdrew \u201cThe Descent of Air India ,\u201d by Jitender Bhargava, a former Air India executive director, who wrote about the national airline\u2019s recent turbulent history. Local media reports said a lawsuit was filed by a former minister who was blamed in the book for causing the airline\u2019s downfall. The publisher also issued a public apology to the minister. Vikram Sampath, an author and the organizer of the Bangalore Literary Festival said, \u201cThe answer to a book you don\u2019t agree with is another one \u2013not a ban or withdrawal.

        "content": " Shipping stuff is a big part of my operation, so it\u2019s with some bemusement that I\u2019ve watched the efforts of Amazon to hide the costs (and challenges) of delivery from customers. First there was Amazon Prime, which all but eliminated shipping charges, and then came all of those stories about  Amazon drones   \u2014 as if moving packages from one place to another is so easy that robots will soon be able to do it. If you think about it, though, the ease with which packages are moved over long distances really is a miracle, and involves some incredibly sophisticated capabilities, like route optimization and real-time tracking. Personally, I think UPS and FedEx could do a better job of highlighting just how good they have become at moving stuff. And maybe that is why Amazon does not want to acknowledge that anything tricky happens after your order leaves the warehouse. It doesn\u2019t own the delivery services, and it doesn\u2019t want to empower other corporations, so it hides the costs involved. That seems to be a reasonable strategy \u2014 especially if it doesn\u2019t  need to make a profit . What does this have to do with Paul Downs Cabinetmakers? A lot, actually. It\u2019s about the expectations that are being created for online shoppers everywhere. We are being taught to think only of the thing we buy and not to consider where it came from or how it gets to us. The upside of this is that we have access to an incredible variety of stuff from all around the world. And the downside? For buyers, there may not be one. But for sellers, it means that a significant cost needs to be considered in a new way. It is increasingly difficult to pass on the costs of shipping by simply tacking them onto the item price. Ten years ago, through no efforts of my own, Google vaulted my work to the top of organic search results for a particular product, conference tables. Suddenly my market expanded from local to national. It took us a while to master the shipping of large, delicate objects over long distances, but we have become very good at it. When we started shipping our work, we added a line item to our price quotes, separating the cost of freight from the price of the table. We are able to get an instant price estimate for shipping our work nearly anywhere, but it is just an estimate because the numbers are based on the exact size and weight of the crate, which we do not know until the table is complete. So we list shipping as a separate line item in the price quote and try to close deals. Some of our clients do not question the line item, and they place the order. Some grumble a bit and place the order anyway. And some look at the total cost and decide not to place the order. The additional cost is an issue, particularly for clients west of the Mississippi, which is why we do not do as much business there as I would like. Last week, I was showing a new employee how our  Google AdWords campaign works . I noticed that a couple of new competitors were showing up on some of our searches \u2014 and that all of their ads included the promise of free shipping. Our ad was the exception. It promises a bunch of good things but not that we will eat the cost of transporting large tables across our enormous country. Seeing the competition throw down that offer made me say, \u201cHmmmm, could we do that?\u201d We send our tables to distant customers via LTL \u2014 less-than-truckload \u2014 trucking services. The parts of the table are packed in foam and cardboard and then into a custom crate. These are big \u2014 usually eight feet long, four feet wide and four feet tall \u2014 and generally weigh about 850 pounds. The labor and materials required to pack up the tables is always included in the price of the table. We charge for the trucking and the installation in a separate line item. I read through my competitors\u2019 sites to review their terms. In every offer I looked at, installation services were excluded. So we were really talking about the trucker\u2019s charges. These are not nothing, but they also are not, for us, a deal-breaker. In 2013 we had revenue of $2.6 million. Of that, we paid out $87,000 for freight, or 3.32 percent, which is not a huge percentage. On the other hand, it was more than we generated in profits last year. Let\u2019s leave that aside for a moment and look at the pros and cons of offering free shipping. The Pros: Our pricing formulas, which predict the amount of time required to make a table, are being overtaken by increased efficiency on the shop floor. Our actual labor costs per table are dropping fast. So we have some extra money available to strengthen our marketing efforts, without raising prices for the tables themselves. Our clients do not seem to object to the price of the tables (at least as far as we can tell). We do know, however, that they object to paying shipping \u2014 we close far fewer sales on West Coast inquiries. While I have no intention of giving away the freight, we could hide it in our prices. We could build a fixed shipping cost into every job, adjust the hours estimate to account for our improved efficiency and keep prices the same. Our most profitable tables are in   the middle of our price  range , generally $10,000 to $20,000. In 2013, the percentage of our revenue produced by that band fell to 33 percent, down from 36 percent the year before. I\u2019d like that segment to grow. Omitting free shipping from our ads probably makes them less effective, particularly if our competition is trumpeting that benefit. The Cons: It ain\u2019t broke, so maybe we shouldn\u2019t fix it. Good clients expect to pay shipping; only bottom feeders want it free. (On the other hand, folding a fixed shipping charge into our table prices would increase the price of the lower-cost tables by the highest proportion, while the higher-cost tables will look cheaper by comparison.) We might devalue our brand. When I click through the ads that offer free shipping, I generally land on sites with cheap product. Will we start to seem like those vendors? Could a flood of cheapskate buyers overwhelm our sales staff? Possibly, but we take good records of incoming calls, so we can identify any change in the overall pattern of callers. We could change course if that happens. So that\u2019s my question, one that might be of interest to any small business that wants to use the Internet to expand its market from local to national or international: Should I offer free shipping? I am leaning strongly toward it, but since I have the opportunity to put this problem in front of my readers, I won\u2019t do anything until I hear from you. What would you do?

        "content": " \u2014\u2014 Once again treating the world as its focus group, Amazon is currently product-testing its latest batch of original online shows. Ten new pilots were  posted   in the retailer\u2019s Instant Video section this week, five for children and five for adults. Your positive reviews could help them become series, joining \u201cAlpha House\u201d and \u201cBetas\u201d from the first round last year. And there may be evidence that the Amazon system works, to a point, because the three comedies on offer are in some ways an advance over the comedies from last time \u2014 more polished and artful, if also more calculated and conventional. More like television, in fact. (Which could just mean that they had larger budgets.) Maybe the same evolution will take place with dramas, because the two that went up this week, the company\u2019s first, leave a lot of room for improvement. This is especially disappointing because both projects involved intriguing talent. It\u2019s no surprise that \u201cThe After,\u201d written and directed by Chris Carter, doesn\u2019t live up to his first and greatest TV creation, \u201cThe X-Files\u201d \u2014 his subsequent series didn\u2019t (though \u201cMillennium\u201d had its moments) and neither have any of the many \u201cX-Files\u201d imitations from other producers. But \u201cThe After\u201d pilot is surprisingly, almost distressingly bad. It has the feel of an elaborate put-on whose meta-joke is never revealed. A particularly clich\u00e9-ridden group \u2014 an Irish drunk, a black convict, a smarmy lawyer (Adrian Pasdar from \u201cHeroes\u201d), a French actress, a dithering Beverly Hills matron (Sharon Lawrence, unrecognizable) and a clown in full costume \u2014 are thrown together by a ludicrous series of contrivances during an unspecified apocalyptic event. The nature of the crisis (earthquake, terrorist attack, alien invasion, the Rapture) is kept vague, allowing for portentous speculation about redemption and the wages of sin. To be fair, in its last moments, \u201cThe After\u201d suddenly veers into the kind of straight-up horror that \u201cThe X-Files\u201d excelled at, offering a slight reason to stick with it if Amazon gives it a series order. The second drama, \u201cBosch,\u201d is a neo-noir cop show that also carries the imprimatur of a well-known writer. In this case it\u2019s the mystery novelist Michael Connelly, who wrote the script (based on his Harry Bosch series) with the TV writer Eric Overmyer (\u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201cTreme\u201d). But the real reason to be excited about the pilot was its casting: Bosch, a hard-core Los Angeles police detective, is played by the excellent actor Titus Welliver, whose quiet, coiled aggression has been seen to good effect in \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and \u201cSons of Anarchy.\u201d Even Mr. Welliver, however, can\u2019t enliven \u201cBosch,\u201d which is dead on the page, despite the best efforts of the accomplished director Jim McKay and an abundance of evocative Los Angeles locations. (Like Elliott Gould\u2019s Philip Marlowe in the Robert Altman adaptation of \u201cThe Long Goodbye,\u201d Bosch lives in an improbably picturesque home with a multimillion-dollar view.) The script by Mr. Connelly and Mr. Overmyer illustrates how hard it is to transfer romanticized pulp to the screen without making it stilted, flat and overly expository, as well as how important it is to avoid the genre\u2019s more familiar aspects. When Bosch, who\u2019s on trial for excessive force, encounters the obligatory cops from internal affairs and calls them the rat squad, it\u2019s about time to give up. Again, though: If the show gets made, it will be worth going back to see whether Mr. Welliver can find something in the character besides the dark past and grim present he\u2019s been given so far. The comedies are all better, but not in earthshaking ways. The most TV-ready of the three is probably \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d written by Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman and Alex Timbers and directed by Paul Weitz (\u201cAbout a Boy\u201d). It\u2019s set in the world of classical music and tries to combine the dark backstage comedy of \u201c Slings   and Arrows \u201d with the gilded New York debauchery of \u201cSex and the City.\u201d Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal is quite amusing as a young maverick conductor hired by a fictional New York orchestra, Saffron Burrows less so as a veteran cellist. Malcolm McDowell and Bernadette Peters guest star. \u201cThe Rebels\u201d stars Natalie Zea as a former cheerleader whose husband dies and leaves her a professional football team, which she decides to run with the help of an inexperienced young general manager (Josh Peck). The pilot is mostly worth watching for Billy Dee Williams\u2019s cameo as the coach. The most distinctive, though not necessarily the most enjoyable, of the half-hour pilots is \u201cTransparent,\u201d a family dramedy that has some of the L.A.-grotesque flavor of \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d \u2014 on which its writer and director, Jill Soloway, worked \u2014 but framed in a more mainstream, \u201cParenthood\u201d style, with just a touch of \u201cArrested Development\u201d zaniness. Reinforcing that last connection is the presence of Jeffrey Tambor, who gives what could grow into a great performance as a father with a secret that\u2019s more life-changing than just selling the family home.

        "name": "When Your App Is in the Cloud ",
        "content": " The telecommunications services business, worth about $1 trillion in annual, global sales, is starting to feel the effects of cloud computing, one of this era\u2019s most important advances in high tech. For the most part, the gear for telecom work comes from incumbents like  Cisco   or  Avaya . The more software-based alternatives for what is called \u201cunified communications\u201d are things like Microsoft\u2019s  Lync . The telecom gear business has not been touched by the crushing economics of software delivered via cloud computing, the kind of low-price, high-versatility product that has caused so many problems for companies making business software, and for many traditional high-cost computer hardware makers. But that\u2019s starting to change. Twilio   is a cloud-based business that produces the means to create any number of communications services, primarily through servers it rents at Amazon Web Services. According to Jeff Lawson, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer, the company has provisioned \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of phone numbers in over 40 countries. Revenue last year was about $50 million, more than double the year before, he said. Twilio generally sits in the background while larger companies use its technology to quickly create things like customer call centers, collaborative communications networks or text and image-messaging functions. Another company, called  Tropo , also allows for faster deployment of communications applications, while others create cloud-based call centers.  Plivo   may be Twilio\u2019s most direct competitor, with cloud-based voice services that can be added to apps. Netflix, among others, uses Plivo for its internal phone system. When Uber texts clients to tell them their cab is five minutes away, or eHarmony links two strangers interested in dating, Twilio is in the background. \u201cOur average selling price is one penny a minute, versus multimillion-dollar boxes from the legacy equipment providers,\u201d Mr. Lawson said. As with much of the cloud business, the initial attraction is making things cheaper and faster to do. Mr. Lawson said Twilio beats the incumbents by 90 percent or more on both counts, but it\u2019s hard to judge that claim independently (though even 50 percent would be impressive). A Cisco spokesman said the two products are not directly comparable, since Cisco\u2019s product can do many more things. What usually happens next with these cloud products, however, is where it gets more interesting. Software developers find new things they can do, once factors like speed and cost become less limiting. Think of  cognitive computing and supercomputing   as a service, or Snapchat, the disappearing image-sharing business  hosted   on Google\u2019s computers. Put that capability on cloud-based applications, and you are likely to get a large number of new communications services. Billing applications can have a feature that puts you directly in touch with a person if you want to dispute a charge, and the person on the other end of the call instantly sees the same charge. People at a sports event have had their season tickets scanned, and by linking that information to their mobile numbers, promotions for, perhaps, two beers for the price of one might be texted to their phones during the game. (How creepy this might seem is for society to work out.) \u201cEvery company wants to do things with less friction and more customer awareness,\u201d Mr. Lawson said. \u201cCommunications companies have historically worked on a development cycle of decades \u2013 the cloud takes that to weeks.\u201d Down the road, the most likely competition for Twilio is Google, Amazon or another cloud provider that wants to offer its own communications applications. Google has email, texting and video, but so far these are pretty diffuse offerings, and Google\u2019s cloud service has offered  ways for developers to tie into Twilio. Amazon Web Services, which seems to be in an ever-increasing number of services and features, so far seems content to have Twilio inside its system, as one more thing developers on Amazon can use. They could partner with it, build their own version or copy it. What is unlikely to happen is for the phenomenon to stop.

        "name": "Amazon To Raise Fees As Revenue Disappoints ",
        "content": " SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon investors might have finally heard the news they have been waiting for: The retailer is raising shipping fees. Amazon has 237 million active customers but as a general rule makes almost no profit. Thursday\u2019s announcement that the company was considering raising prices by as much as 50 percent on its $79 Prime shipping program could mean $500 million for its skimpy bottom line. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve ever seen Amazon flex its muscles in terms of pricing,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely significant.\u201d The news came in a conference call when the Seattle-based retailer discussed its fourth-quarter earnings. The announcement helped deflect disappointment that Amazon\u2019s torrid growth might be slowing. Amazon has been pouring money into new ventures, ranging from new warehouses to free videos for Prime subscribers. The eternal question is when it will turn all that expansion into profits. Raising fees for the estimated 25 million Prime subscribers indicates that moment might be sooner, rather than later. \u201cThey don\u2019t think they will lose customers,\u201d Mr. Munster said. \u201cThey are doing this from a position of strength.\u201d Still, there are risks for Amazon. \u201cThe more expensive Prime is, the more they are going to have to live up to their promises,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research. \u201cIn my experience, a significant portion of the deliveries take more than the advertised two days.\u201d By her estimates, Amazon is losing $1 billion to $2 billion a year on Prime. Without the Prime news, the dismay over the results would have been palpable. Considered in isolation, the  quarterly numbers   were terrific. Revenue was $25.59 billion, up 20 percent from the quarter in 2012. Earnings per share were 51 cents, up from 21 cents. But expectation is all, and Wall Street expected more. Analysts had forecast the retailer would report revenue of $26.06 billion and earnings of 66 cents a share. The stock immediately fell as much as 10 percent, or $40. Then came word of the potential Prime increase, the first in the program\u2019s nine years. The stock quickly shaved about half its losses, dropping only 4 percent in after-hours trading. Amazon shares had been up sharply in regular trading Thursday. They rose $18.81, to $403.01, just short of the stock\u2019s record high. Thomas J. Szkutak, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said the price increase for Prime, if it happens, would be $20 to $40. \u201cShipping costs have gone up a lot, fuel costs have gone up a lot,\u201d he said. He gave few other details, nor would he say exactly how many Prime customers there are. Amazon is usually downbeat about the next quarter, and in this it did not disappoint. Sales would grow in the first quarter by 13 to 24 percent from 2013, the company said, while it once again forecast that it might lose money. Operating income in the first quarter of 2013 was $181 million. Despite its new ventures, Amazon is still primarily a retailer, which makes its growth all the more remarkable. Amazon revenue grew 22 percent in 2013. Walmart\u2019s sales, by comparison, rose only 2.2 percent. Amazon, in fact, is growing faster than global e-commerce sales, which according to emarketer.com rose 18 percent last year. \u201cAmazon has a reputation among consumers of being the lowest price, even if they are not always, and of having the best shipping,\u201d said Yoram Wurmser, an e-marketer retail analyst. \u201cEventually they\u2019ll run out of white space but in the meantime they are entering new markets like groceries.\" The company\u2019s valuation is increasing so fast \u2014 shares are up tenfold in five years \u2014 that skeptics wonder if things are getting out of hand. Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners who has been cautious on Amazon\u2019s prospects, laid out some of the growth conundrums on Thursday in a research note. Amazon is now valued at $176 billion, he said, which gives it the 17th-largest valuation in the S.&P. 500-stock index. But Amazon also has by far the highest price to earnings ratio among companies with a market capitalization above $25 billion. It\u2019s ranked only 18th in revenue growth using the same criteria. \u201cWe see that the price investors are paying is expensive for the current level of revenue growth given the uncertainty around the degree of leverage that the company may be able to achieve,\u201d Mr. Gillis wrote. Amazon may be the next Walmart, he added, but \u201cit may take years for Amazon to grow into this valuation fully.\u201d A worker at an Amazon warehouse in Phoenix before Cyber Monday, one of the biggest online shopping days of the year. | Ralph D.

When it says it is merely thinking of doing something \u2014 as it did Thursday with  the   first-ever price increase   for Amazon Prime shipping service \u2014 it makes news. It also makes news when it talks about something that it is planning to do, maybe, a bunch of years from now, in the unlikely event everything works out. Yes, we\u2019re talking drones.

        "content": " The Washington Post has significantly increased its budget and plans to make dozens of newsroom hires under its new owner, the Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, the paper\u2019s executive editor, Marty Baron, said in an interview. Mr. Bezos has closely consulted with The Post\u2019s leadership in plotting its growth strategy and the moves represent Mr. Bezos\u2019 \u2018\u2018first mark on the paper,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Baron said Wednesday. The Post will introduce several initiatives this year, Mr. Baron said in a memo to his staff on Wednesday. There will be five new politics reporters as well as photo editors, data visualization specialists, news desk staff and web designers. It will add a breaking news desk and a Sunday style and arts section, as well as a revamped Sunday magazine that will be \u2018\u2018bigger in dimension and in the number of pages, with a new design and a range of new features.\u2019\u2019 The plan will be executed quickly \u2014 interviews for new hires began weeks ago \u2014 and represents \u2018\u2018a substantial expansion of the budget,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Baron said, though he declined to provide precise figures. Shortly after Mr. Bezos bought the paper, Mr. Baron and other senior staff were \u2018\u2018asked to come up with ideas for what we wanted to do,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Baron said. In late October, he and several colleagues flew to Bellevue, Wash., to meet with Mr. Bezos and present the plan. There were also conference calls and email exchanges, as well as in-person meetings at The Post\u2019s offices in Washington. Mr. Bezos would \u2018\u2018just challenge our assumptions, cause us to rethink things,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s spent his entire life and his entire career thinking about where the consumer will be in the long run, and where the technology will be in the long run.\u2019\u2019 The crucial question, and the one that preoccupies Mr. Bezos, Mr. Baron said, is, \u2018\u2018How do we produce growth?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018And obviously our growth,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Baron, \u2018\u2018as well as the growth of institutions like The New York Times is likely to come from the digital arena.\u2019\u2019 There has been fervent speculation about Mr. Bezos\u2019 intentions since August, when he announced that he was paying $250 million in cash to acquire The Post. Many hoped he would try to reinvent the ailing newspaper business just as he had revolutionized retail at Amazon.com. Mr. Baron said he believed that Mr. Bezos \u2018\u2018was purchasing The Post in order to make more of it, rather than make less of it.\u2019\u2019 That became clear in their discussions about the paper\u2019s initiatives. \u2018\u2018His entire business history is oriented around growth,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Baron said. Mr. Bezos has not weighed in on individual hires, Mr. Baron said, but his involvement has been more at a strategic level, discussing the paper\u2019s priorities and goals. \u2018\u2018He hasn\u2019t been passive,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Baron said. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s heavily engaged, keenly interested in what our ideas are. He offered his own thoughts and expressed a willingness to invest.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " IN THE 11 MONTHS since the fashion eminence Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley parted company with Vogue, he has pursued a number of new gigs. Since February, he has been an editor at large for the Russian version of Num\u00e9ro magazine. There was talk of a late-night TV show, which has not gotten off the ground. \u201cNothing has happened with that recently, no meetings, nothing is happening,\u201d Mr. Talley said. (\u201cMy Ed McMahon would be Gloria von Thurn und Taxis,\u201d he joked.) Recently he interviewed Diane von Furstenberg for \u201cEntertainment Tonight.\u201d And in December, Mr. Talley was named artistic director for Zappos, the online retailer specializing in shoes and known for its perky customer service representatives and relaxed return policy. Well, to be precise, he\u2019ll be the artistic director for Zappos\u2019s lesser-known couture site, where the same return policy exists. (Whether it\u2019s a pair of $50 Chucks or a $2,050 Calvin Klein whisper white dress, customers have a year to return the item.) On Wednesday, Zappos Couture revealed its redesigned website with Mr. Talley as the centerpiece. \u201cI took the job because I felt that this was a new experiment that I needed to have going toward the future because digital and online is so important in today\u2019s world,\u201d Mr. Talley said in a phone interview from Basta Pasta in Manhattan. The reconceived site will include features like Dude of the Month (Mr. Talley\u2019s friend Marc Jacobs is up first), book recommendations (Mr. Talley is a very big fan of the Mike Tyson memoir, \u201cUndisputed Truth\u201d) and commentary on celebrities and apparel. For the debut, Mr. Talley tapped the fashion photographer Francesco Carrozzini, the son of the Italian Vogue editor Franca Sozzani, to shoot an editorial feature. For the Zappos team, Mr. Talley\u2019s presence on the site, not to mention his Rolodex, is a welcome one. Zappos Couture has existed since 2004, but it has had a hard time attracting luxury designers and brands to the site. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a slow process, for sure,\u201d said Jennifer Sidary, the head of Zappos Couture. Ms. Sidary was approached by Mr. Talley\u2019s agent at Designers Management Agency shortly after she spoke at a digital conference hosted by Women\u2019s Wear Daily in June. \u201cAndr\u00e9 and his team didn\u2019t even know that we had a couture site because it\u2019s still kind of a well-kept secret among customers and brands,\u201d Ms. Sidary said. Since Mr. Talley has come on board, she said, Oscar de la Renta has agreed to sell jewelry and handbags on the site. Mr. Talley is well known for his devotion to fashion history, and his deep connections to the industry \u2014 he revealed in a talk at the 92nd Street Y last year that Karl Lagerfeld gave him $50,000 for his 50th birthday \u2014 but he said that the new job was teaching him to look at fashion a little differently. \u201cI was looking at shoes at the store I just left today, and I didn\u2019t think, \u2018Oh, those shoes I like,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Will that customer respond to that shoe in a picture on their computer?\u2019 \u201d Though Mr. Talley sounded a bit wistful for his days at Vogue (\u201cI miss the gilded cage,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s with a capital G and a capital C.\u201d), the new job has perks, too. His salary at Zappos Couture is \u201cvery generous, very generous,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney isn\u2019t everything, but when you become my age at 65 and you\u2019re thinking of going into the second, the third, the fourth stage, you have to think about money,\u201d he said. (Likewise, he told Women\u2019s Wear Daily after he joined Russia Num\u00e9ro last year that he \u201cneeded more financial security.\u201d) Despite making the transition into digital, Mr. Talley has never bought a clothing item online. \u201cI have, of course, not bought anything online except music and books,\u201d he said. Ms. Sidary, for one, is hopeful that in time he will become an online Zappos customer. \u201cHe can definitely start buying Uggs on our Zappos site,\u201d she said. \u201cWe actually even carry his size. Maybe I can get him to start buying his Uggs online, right?\u201d Zappos Couture revealed its redesigned website with the fashion eminence Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley as the centerpiece. | Elizabeth Lippman for The New York Times",

        "name": "Some Businesses Go Creative on Prices, Applying Technology ",
        "content": " Many business owners struggle with pricing. Should their first concern be covering costs or figuring out what the market will bear? How do they determine what the market will pay without raising prices high enough that some customers flee? And can they offer discounts without damaging their price brand? There may be no easy or universal answers to these questions, but new thinking and new technology has made it possible for some, like the airline and hotel industries, to use what is known as dynamic pricing to vary prices according to demand and fill seats and rooms more efficiently. Now, more small businesses are finding ways to adapt their strategies. You can find consultants that charge for results rather than by the hour, restaurants that charge what is essentially a ticket price that varies according to how busy the restaurant is, and even some businesses that ask customers to pay what they wish. And Uber, a Silicon Valley company founded four years ago, has a mobile app that connects a small army of black cars with people who need rides in 70 cities worldwide and employs ''surge pricing.'' Uber, which takes 20 percent of all fares, charges more when demand is high and the supply of cars low. ''You get far more cars on the road and they stay out longer when surge pricing is in effect,'' said Travis Kalanick, a co-founder. You also get some cranky customers. In the last few months, the company has received an onslaught of complaints when the cost of a ride rose to as much as seven times the normal rate during a snowstorm and on New Year's Eve. ''One of the things we've learned,'' Mr. Kalanick said, ''is that the more crisply you deliver the message to the customer and the more you set expectations ahead of time, the more you get to a place where there's no issue with it.'' Uber's prices are controlled by an algorithm -- technology that is increasingly available to even the smallest enterprises. Craig Clark, for example, sells more than 2,600 items -- vintage china, bras, house numbers -- on a variety of online marketplaces. Two years ago, he was collecting $2,000 a month in revenue from his sale of house numbers on Amazon.com. ''Six months into it, my sales went down all of the sudden,'' he said. ''Amazon went out and got a wholesale account and started selling the numbers themselves. So you're not just competing against other sellers, you're also competing against Amazon.'' Mr. Clark had been laid off from his job as an analyst for a telecom company outside Philadelphia, so his online retail ventures had become his only source of income. Like many Amazon sellers, he started re-pricing items manually, but found the process wildly time-consuming. And mistakenly pricing a Jenga game at $13.99, instead of $23.99, once cost him $1,200. Then, he learned of FeedVisor, which makes re-pricing software. ''You tell them what the item cost you, the commission you pay to Amazon, and your highest and lowest price,'' said Mr. Clark, whose annual revenue is approximately $500,000. ''FeedVisor then algorithmically decides the best price within your parameters and what everyone else is selling at.'' The company, one of many that sells re-pricing software, charges 1 percent of sales and provides a dashboard that lets sellers analyze sales and profits. Using FeedVisor last summer, Mr. Clark said his ''sales on Coobie bras went up 25 percent almost overnight.'' FeedVisor reduced the price on the bras, which he was selling for between $19 and $23, by $2 or more to make them more competitive. That reduced his profit margin, Mr. Clark said, to 37 percent from 39 percent -- but increased his volume. The software also produced sales increases on other items of from 15 to 40 percent, he said, and helped him unload stale inventory, such as a pallet of pots and pans. ''I hadn't sold one in six months,'' said Mr. Clark, ''and I got rid of them in four days.'' Restaurants, too, are using innovative pricing strategies. In September 2012, Groupon acquired a restaurant reservation engine, Savored, and has since integrated it into a new high-end division called Groupon Reserve. Instead of offering customers, say, $50 off a meal as traditional daily deals do, Savored lets restaurants offer customers a percentage off an entire meal in return for dining at a specified time. Cacio e Vino, a Sicilian restaurant based in Manhattan, has been using the app for two years, said Christine Ehlert, the manager. ''On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, we offer a certain number of tables for a 40 percent discount,'' she said. Wednesday and Thursday diners may get 30 percent off through the app and customers who make reservations for between 5 and 7 p.m. on Friday and Saturday get a 25 percent discount. Ms. Ehlert said that she initially worried whether the discounting might damage her brand. ''But since we only offer a limited amount of discounted tables at certain times,'' she said, ''I feel that we can explain to people that it's a way to drive new business to us in off hours.'' Cacio e Vino pays Groupon a flat fee of $2.50 per diner. ''The nice thing is that if it seems we're going to be too busy,'' Ms. Ehlert said, ''I can call our rep at Savored and close out the deal.'' Before using Savored, she said, the restaurant typically had $800 in sales on Mondays and Tuesdays. ''Now, it's between $1,200 and $1,500,'' she said, with a profit margin on the discounted customers that is about half that of the full-price customers. She said slightly fewer than half of the restaurant's discounted customers come back, typically for another discounted meal. Frank and Rhonda Duffy run Duffy Realty of Atlanta, one of a growing number of real estate agencies trying new pricing strategies. The Duffys charge an upfront listing fee of $500 and one third of 1 percent when a house sells. According to Zillow, the agency has about 800 active listings and had more than 1,400 sales in the last 12 months. Mr. Duffy said the agency's 2013 revenue was $5.3 million. For the reduced fee, the Duffys offer limited service. The firm adds homes to the local Multiple Listing Service, as well as on Zillow and Trulia, supplies sellers with a 60-point, do-it-yourself marketing guide, rents lockboxes for $100, and charges $94 for a home to be professionally photographed. One of the firm's four listing specialists is likely to come to take your information. Then, a team of specialists, including client services representatives, buyer's agents and contract negotiators, moves buyers and sellers through the sale process. To provide an incentive to agents from other firms to bring buyers, the Duffys encourage sellers to offer the buyer's agents commissions of 3 percent or even 4 percent. Most sellers do it, he said, because they still come out ahead. On the sale of a $300,000 home, for example, a traditional agent might split a 6 percent commission, or $18,000, with a buyer's agent. A seller listing with Duffy will pay a $1,520 commission ($500 plus one third of 1 percent, or $1,020), plus 3 percent ($9,000) or 4 percent ($12,000) for a buyer's agent, or a total of between $10,520 and $13,520. The pricing model does not suit all sellers. ''The danger is you're not getting the advice and guidance,'' said Frank S. Alexander, a real estate professor at Emory Law School. ''What do you with inspection results, or during the due diligence period, or in a contract negotiation?'' For experienced sellers, or in a particularly hot market, that may not matter. Craig Clark, who sells items on Amazon and ships 40 to 100 packages daily, uses special software to constantly gauge demand and the competition, and adjusts his prices accordingly.

        "content": " We\u2019ve  just published an article   about how small companies are starting to use pricing strategies and technologies that previously had been available only to large companies. For example, Craig Clark sells more than 2,600 items \u2014 vintage china, bras, house numbers \u2014 on a variety of online marketplaces. Two years ago, he was collecting $2,000 a month in revenue from the sale of house numbers on Amazon. \u201cSix months into it, my sales went down all of the sudden,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon went out and got a wholesale account and started selling the numbers themselves. So you\u2019re not just competing against other sellers, you\u2019re also competing against Amazon.\u201d As Donna Fenn writes, Mr. Clark had been laid off from his job as an analyst for a telecom company outside of Philadelphia, so his online retail ventures had become his only source of income. Like many Amazon sellers, he started repricing items manually but found the process wildly time-consuming. Then, he learned of  FeedVisor , which makes repricing software. \u201cYou tell them what the item cost you, the commission you pay to Amazon and your highest and lowest price,\u201d said Mr. Clark, whose annual revenue is about $500,000. \u201cFeedVisor then algorithmically decides the best price within your parameters and what everyone else is selling at.\u201d Please read Mr. Clark\u2019s example as well as the others in the article and then tell us what you think.

        "name": "IBM Has Big Plans for Investments in the Cloud ",
        "content": " IBM is moving rapidly on its plans to spend heavily on cloud computing. It expects to spend $1.2 billion this year on increasing the number and quality of computing centers it has worldwide. The move reflects the speed at which the business of renting a lot of computing power via the Internet is replacing the conventional business of selling mainframe computers, computer servers, and associated hardware and software. Champions of cloud computing cite both lower costs and faster deployment as the reasons for the shift. ''This is a key growth area for IBM,'' said Erich Clementi, senior vice president of IBM Global Technology Services. ''We are building out a global footprint.'' In addition to selling raw computing and data storage capabilities, he said, IBM plans to offer over 150 software and software development products in its cloud. Among the products is Watson, an advanced cognitive computing framework. Last week, IBM's chief executive, Virginia Rometty, announced a new business group inside IBM for Watson. ''This is a series of investments that started years ago,'' Mr. Clementi said. ''Under Gini, we're doubling down.'' One reason for IBM's urgency is the rapid growth of competitors, in particular Amazon Web Services, but also Google and Microsoft. All these cloud providers, which offer a service that eats into IBM's traditional revenue, have said they will spend at least $1 billion annually on cloud computing for the foreseeable future. Last year, IBM paid $2 billion to buy Softlayer, a cloud company with 13 data centers. IBM already had 12 data centers of its own, in the United States and overseas, for a total of 25. The smallest of these contains over 16,000 servers, and most are significantly larger. By the end of 2014, the company plans to have 40 centers in 13 countries scattered over five continents. In addition to building computing centers in mainland China and the Middle East, IBM will build two facilities in the United States specifically designed to handle government workloads. The China and government initiatives, in particular, seem aimed at Amazon. Amazon came into China only in December, where it has to be to attract Chinese businesses. Over much of last year, IBM contested a $600 million deal between Amazon and the Central Intelligence Agency for cloud services before withdrawing its protest in October. IBM is likely to offer specialized clouds that meet health care and financial regulations at some point in the future. As all the competitors begin to jockey for contracts from start-ups and established businesses, each is expected to bring its own relative strengths to bear. For IBM, Mr. Clementi said, this would include the ability to integrate existing computing facilities with an external cloud; stronger management and privacy controls; and a deep understanding of business processes. ''I don't encounter Google outside of their traditional work,'' he said. ''They aren't delivering the ability to deliver a mobile application that can hook into a general ledger. Sometimes I run into Amazon.'' Referring to more traditional competitors, he said, ''With Hewlett-Packard, I don't see the reach or the breadth.'' H.P. has also been running a cloud business, and in November the company announced with Salesforce.com a deal to run Salesforce's cloud-based software on H.P. machines. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. Virginia Rometty, IBM's chief, said this month that IBM would invest more than $1 billion in a new group related to Watson. (PHOTOGRAPH BY BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS)",

        "content": " In the first unionization vote ever held at an Amazon facility in the United States, a small group of technical workers at the company\u2019s warehouse in Middletown, Del., voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday against forming a union. The workers, responsible for maintaining and repairing the warehouse\u2019s equipment, voted to 21 to 6 against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the union announced late Wednesday. The National Labor Relations Board ordered the election after the machinists\u2019 union filed a petition on Dec. 8 on behalf of the warehouse\u2019s 30 technical workers. Wednesday\u2019s vote does not affect the vast majority of the 1,500 packers and shippers at the distribution center, one of more than 40 Amazon warehouses across the United States. \u201cThe workers at Amazon faced intense pressure from managers and anti-union consultants hired to suppress this organizing drive,\u201d said John Carr, a spokesman for the union. \u201cOur employees have made it clear that they prefer a direct connection with Amazon,\u201d said Mary Osako, a company spokeswoman. \u201cThis direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the wants and needs of our employees.\u201d Amazon has vigorously opposed unionization by its employees, saying that it has competitive wages and an open-door policy that encourages employees to bring their concerns directly to management. Officials of the machinists\u2019 union said safety and promotions were among the main concerns of the Delaware technical workers. Amazon, based in Seattle, has handily beaten back previous rumblings in favor of unionization in the United States, but last year hundreds of its workers in Germany  went on strike   as part of a long and continuing dispute over wages.",

        "name": "Holiday Sales Slide 60% at Barnes & Noble Nook Unit, Pointing to Tests for Chief ",
        "content": " In late 2009, Barnes & Noble introduced its first e-reader, the Nook, and within a relatively short time had picked up 25 percent of the e-book market, slicing into Amazon\u2019s dominance. Now those gains seem to have faded. On Thursday, Barnes & Noble, the nation\u2019s last remaining major bookstore chain, said that it had steep sales declines in its digital division during the holiday period, continuing a steady decline for a unit that was once the centerpiece of its growth strategy. Revenue in the Nook division, which includes digital content and devices,  was $125 million,   a 60.5 percent drop compared with the nine-week holiday period a year earlier. Barnes & Noble executives said their total share of the e-book market had fallen to 20 percent. The drop-off underscores the significant challenges facing the new chief executive, Michael P. Huseby, a company insider who was appointed to the post on Wednesday. He said Barnes & Noble was determined to find a way to reverse the losses. \u201cOur objective is to stop the decline and turn it around so we get back into growth mode,\u201d Mr. Huseby said in a telephone interview. \u201cObviously the loss was big. So that\u2019s why our focus is on rationalizing the business.\u201d The news was much cheerier from the brick-and-mortar side of Barnes & Noble, with its 673 retail stores. Bookstore sales decreased only 6.6 percent compared with the previous year, to $1.1 billion. Mr. Huseby said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the company\u2019s performance in retail bookstores, which have set aside space in recent years for toys, educational games, greeting cards and other gift items. Mitchell S. Klipper, the chief executive of Barnes & Noble\u2019s retail division, said he did not expect any significant changes ahead in the bookstores. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see any major departures in the near future in our stores,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with what we have.\u201d The losses in the Nook division reflect Barnes & Noble\u2019s decreasing digital ambitions, as it declined to release a new color tablet in 2013. The bookseller has said it will pull back from trying to compete in the crowded tablet market against big companies like Amazon and Apple. Asked to explain the decline in digital sales, Mr. Huseby said that Barnes & Noble was fighting intense competition from Amazon and Apple and deep discounts on books from other retailers that influenced Barnes & Noble\u2019s own pricing. Analysts suggested that the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against publishers, which resulted in allowing retailers to discount e-books more freely, might have contributed to Barnes & Noble\u2019s troubles. Mr. Huseby, previously the president of Barnes & Noble and chief executive of Nook Media, added that Barnes & Noble was looking into forming partnerships with other device manufacturers, but that no plans had been completed. Jack W. Perry, a publishing consultant, said that Barnes & Noble\u2019s position had become precarious. \u201cThey need to get their act together now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to do something now before the Nook is no longer viable.\u201d Barnes & Noble has sold more than 10 million Nook devices since its debut in 2009. The results, which cover the nine-week period that ended Dec. 28, are likely to further unsettle publishers, authors and agents who have fretted about Barnes & Noble\u2019s stability for years. Since Borders went out of business in 2011, Barnes & Noble is the last significant bookstore chain in the country. Publishers depend on the bookseller for display space and the spontaneous purchases that can result from casual browsing. Last year, Barnes & Noble\u2019s holiday results were disappointing, as sales from bookstores and BN.com decreased 10.9 percent, to $1.2 billion, from the comparable nine-week holiday period in 2011. Sales in the company's brick-and-mortar bookstores were less grim, with a 6.6 percent decrease from the previous year, to $1.1 billion. | Mario Anzuoni/Reuters",

        "name": "Book Chain Promotes Digital Boss To Top Post ",
        "content": " Barnes & Noble appointed one of its top executives on Wednesday to fill the post of chief executive, a job that has been vacant since William Lynch Jr. abruptly resigned from the company in July. Michael P. Huseby, the president of Barnes & Noble and chief executive of its digital division, Nook Media, will become the chief executive effective immediately, a statement from Barnes & Noble said. His appointment comes as Barnes & Noble, the nation\u2019s largest bookstore chain, continues its struggles to find its footing. It has invested heavily in its digital division in the hopes of competing with Amazon, building a line of e-readers and tablets and devoting significant floor space in its stores to their sales. But sales have been disappointing and the company has recently failed to make headway in gaining e-book market share from Amazon. Last year, the company signaled it would scale back its efforts in the digital device market, where it failed to gain traction against powerful competitors like Amazon and Apple. When Mr. Lynch stepped down last summer, Barnes & Noble, the nation\u2019s largest bookstore chain, made no immediate moves to replace him. Instead it made Mr. Huseby head of the digital division, while Leonard Riggio, the company\u2019s chairman, largely focused on the retail bookstores. In November, Barnes & Noble said that its revenue declined 8 percent, to $1.7 billion, in the quarter that ended Oct. 26. Mr. Huseby brings a largely financial background to the role of chief executive. He joined the company in March 2012 as its chief financial officer, and had previously worked as the chief financial officer of Cablevision. \u201cAlthough a relative newcomer to the retail book business, he has quickly developed a comprehensive understanding of the unique opportunities and challenges the company faces, and he has a vision for the future in which I am in complete accord,\u201d Mr. Riggio said in a statement. \u201cMike also has a passion for bookselling, which makes him a perfect fit for this job.\u201d Barnes & Noble also said on Wednesday that it had closed one of its remaining bookstores in Manhattan, a store on Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron district. Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble, said it was a college bookstore whose sales have been in decline for the last decade. Much of its business had already been transferred to campus stores operated by Barnes & Noble College. With sales of print books flat or in decline, publishing executives say they are more concerned than ever about the viability of Barnes & Noble, the last major bookstore chain standing. Borders went out of business in 2011, taking with it more than 650 stores. While publishers have experimented with promoting their books on social media and elsewhere, many fear that display space in brick-and-mortar stores is not easily replaced.",

        "name": "Billion-dollar valuations as a milestone and omen; As more tech companies reach benchmark, fears of dot-com crash return ",
        "content": " Fab.com, an online retailer selling affordable high design, seemed last year as if it could be the next Amazon. Just a few months later, however, it looked as if it could become the next Pets.com. Big-name venture capitalists, including the Andreessen Horowitz firm, poured money into the company over the past few years, lured by its startling growth rate. After raising some $170 million in venture funding, Fab accepted an additional $150 million in June, a round that valued the company at $1 billion and vaulted it into the club of billion-dollar technology start-ups that include Snapchat, Pinterest, Evernote, Spotify and Dropbox. But by the end of the summer, Fab had fallen from that elite. Amid financial trouble, it fired hundreds of employees. A company co-founder and the chief operating officer left the company. Its valuation sank below $1 billion, leaving some investors with shares worth less then they had invested. The rise and stumbles of Fab demonstrate how swiftly the fortunes of start-ups can change. At the company\u2019s giddy high point, it also illustrated why some billion-dollar-plus valuations have raised concerns of a new dot-com bubble. \u2018\u2018Predicting what\u2019s undervalued and what\u2019s overvalued is fabulously hard,\u2019\u2019 said Josh Lerner, a professor of entrepreneurship at the Harvard Business School. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a trope to see a young, highly valued company and say it\u2019s wrong, but sometimes it is.\u2019\u2019 Fab declined to comment for this article. The growth of the billion-dollar club has eclipsed the exuberance of more than a decade ago. In the three years from 2011 through 2013, there were at least 34 investments that valued companies at $1 billion or more, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, compared with 16 from 1998 to 2000. Yet it is more than a speculative frenzy that is driving up the valuations of these companies. A number of changes in the capital markets, the venture capital industry and the public equity markets have conspired to make it easier than ever for unproven start-ups to be valued at $1 billion or more. For one, the stock and merger markets have demonstrated that many companies\u2019 high-flying valuations are justified. Facebook\u2019s stock has surged after its early stumbles. Newly public companies like Twitter are performing well. And Instagram and Tumblr both sold for more than $1 billion each, emboldening venture capitalists. \u2018\u2018A number of high-profile companies in the social media space have been successful,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Lerner said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s creating a feedback loop.\u2019\u2019 Another factor driving up valuations is the 38 percent rise last year in the Nasdaq composite index, which is heavy with technology companies. For venture investors eager to find the next big thing, the healthy stock market acts as a green light to keep pouring money into private companies that might go public or get sold. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s always this long and almost irrational exuberance tied to the enthusiasm, excitement and growth of a company when the economy is doing well,\u2019\u2019 said Jayshree Ullal, chief executive of Arista Networks, a cloud networking company reportedly valued near $2.5 billion. What is more, the availability of cheap financing for companies and investors, which has helped buoy the stock market, is allowing investors to easily finance deals and borrow money. Pension funds and endowments are putting more money into venture funds. In the third quarter, venture capital firms raised $4.1 billion, an increase of 28 percent from the previous quarter, according to the National Venture Capital Association. And with so much cash to deploy, venture funds are competing with one another to invest the money, a process that often drives up valuations. When the ride-sharing service Lyft was seeking to raise a new round of financing last year, many firms, including Greylock Partners, were interested in investing. But before they could offer Lyft any cash, Andreessen Horowitz swooped in with an offer that Lyft could not refuse, according to people briefed on the situation. Andreessen Horowitz is known in Silicon Valley for such tactics, having had success with companies like Facebook, Twitter and Skype. According to CB Insights, which tracks venture investing, the average size of the firm\u2019s investment was substantially higher than those of rivals New Enterprise Associates and Greylock. But Andreessen Horowitz is not alone. In the third quarter, venture capital firms invested $7.8 billion, an increase of 12 percent from the previous quarter, according to the venture capital association and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The competition is especially tough when it comes to later-stage investments in the most admired billion-dollar tech companies, a group that includes such companies as Square, Box and Uber. And the fight is becoming more fierce as new investors jockey to compete with venture funds. Competition from later-stage investors like Meritech Capital and Institutional Venture Partners and hedge funds like Tiger Global and Valiant Capital Management has driven up valuations. These funds expect lower returns than venture capitalists, so they take less risk by investing in more mature companies that are safer bets. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019ve got funds and you need to basically deploy pretty big chunks of capital, wouldn\u2019t you rather invest in things that seem like a sure thing?\u2019\u2019 said Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures. In a widely read blog post on tech companies worth more than $1 billion, Ms. Lee called the group the \u2018\u2018Unicorn Club.\u2019\u2019 Last May, Evernote, a company that makes a productivity app, raised money that drove the valuation significantly higher. Just seven months later, interest from Valiant, a hedge fund based in San Francisco that also invested in Dropbox, and the AGC Equity Partners\u2019 affiliate Capital, elevated the valuation to a reported $2 billion. For those venture firms that aren\u2019t able to invest in the top companies, the inclination is to spread out their investments among a broad pool of companies, many of which are derivative. When the deals site Groupon was thriving, for example, big investors including Amazon poured money into rival LivingSocial. For a time, the company was valued at more than $1.5 billion. But in February, LivingSocial took $110 million in new funding at a lower valuation, a so-called down round. \u2018\u2018These funds have a lot of money and push money out into whatever looks hot,\u2019\u2019 said Alexander Ljungqvist, professor of finance at New York University. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks.\u2019\u2019 With so much cash in the bank, many companies that in previous cycles might have been prompted to sell or go public can now stay private longer \u2014 a strategy they saw Facebook use with success. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing LinkedIn, Twitter, etc., going out at $20 billion valuations instead of a billion like eBay or Amazon,\u2019\u2019 said John Backus, founder of New Atlantic Ventures and a member of the National Venture Capital Association board. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a lot more value accruing to the private investors.\u2019\u2019 And the rise in so-called secondary offerings, which allow executives and early employees to sell some of their shares when the company is still private, is driving up valuations as new investors compete for a limited number of shares on the secondary market. Some find recent valuations unreasonable. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know any other way to value a company than to look at its future cash flow and compare it to current cash flow,\u2019\u2019 said Brian Hamilton, the chairman of Sageworks, which analyzes the financial strength of private companies. \u2018\u2018Where we are today, I don\u2019t see where the values are coming from based upon any judicious or even very optimistic view of a company\u2019s future cash flow and revenue.\u2019\u2019 But many investors contend that young companies will one day justify their eye-popping valuations. \u2018\u2018Valuations are never a reflection of today\u2019s performance, it\u2019s a reflection of the future opportunity,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Ullal of Arista Networks said. \u2018\u2018Most of these companies grow into their valuations nicely and those that don\u2019t fall by the wayside.\u2019\u2019 And technology boosters note that the market for Internet companies is larger than it was 15 years ago. \u2018\u2018In the last cycle, there were barely 500 million people online, and they were all on 56k modems,\u2019\u2019 said David Lee of SV Angel, an early-stage investor. \u2018\u2018By 2015, there will be five billion people with a supercomputer in their hands.\u2019\u2019 Still, to some, Fab and other companies that attain high valuations are a sign that too much money is chasing too few good ideas. \u2018\u2018This is a drama that has played out many times before,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Lerner of Harvard. \u2018\u2018The music inevitably stops at a certain point.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " Kevin Kelly is not a dumb guy \u2014 far from it actually. As the founding executive editor of Wired and one of the people who helped build  The Well , among the earliest online communities, he has done a good job of seeing what is coming next for decades. But last year, he had what sounded to me like a dumb idea. Mr. Kelly edits and owns  Cool Tools , a website that writes about neat stuff and makes small money off referral revenue from Amazon when people proceed to buy some of those things. He decided to edit the thousands of reviews that had accrued over the last 10 years into a self-published print catalog \u2014 also called \u201cCool Tools\u201d \u2014 which he would then sell for $39.99. So, to review, his idea was to manufacture a floppy 472-page catalog that would weigh 4.5 pounds, full of buying advice that had already appeared free on the web, essentially turning weightless pixels into bulky bundles of atoms. To make it happen, he crowdsourced designs from all over the world, found a printer in China and then arranged for shipping and distribution. It all seemed a little quixotic and, well, beside the point. Except the first printing of 10,000 copies, just in time for Christmas, sold out immediately, a second printing of 12,000 will go on sale at Amazon next week and a third printing of 20,000 copies is underway. So, not so dumb after all. \u201cIt surprised me as well,\u201d he said by phone from his home office in Pacifica, Calif. \u201cI wish I had known. Paper is really unnecessary for a lot of things, but very good at certain things. And this turned out to be one of them.\u201d The book, which is full of detailed reviews of all manner of products, along with idiosyncratic illustrations, has a thrown-together appeal that invites browsing of another sort. As it turns out, there is something magical in the book\u2019s juxtaposition of stuff, folklore and product reviews, sort of like a modern version of  the Whole Earth   Catalog , a chatty, user-generated publication that prefigured the web and that Mr. Kelly once edited. \u201cThere is something about having that large expanse of real estate in your lap, something about the format, that is extremely satisfying,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving many different things you may be interested in on a page, as opposed to a single thing surrounded by ads as it is on the web, leads to the formation of different connections and leads to a different experience.\u201d Publishers who turned out under-designed and under-edited books and magazines in the Internet age have learned the hard way that consumers expect excellence in print. Just as McSweeney\u2019s  grand experimental   newspaper Panorama   suggested in 2009, and as big, beautiful magazines like Vogue prove every month, print is not dead, it simply has some very specific attributes that need to be leveraged. Good printed work includes a mix of elements in which juxtaposition and tempo tell their own story, the kind of story best told with ink and paper. At a time when e-book sales  seem to be flattening , there is something to be learned from Mr. Kelly\u2019s self-published curio. Print continues to be a remarkable technology, if not as lucrative as it used to be, with its own durable glories. I was just on vacation with five women \u2014 I was related to all of them, so don\u2019t get any ideas \u2014 and watched as a single paperback of   Cheryl Strayed\u2019s magnificent \u201cWild\u201d  was passed around, discussed and shared. I\u2019ve never seen that kind of interaction over an e-book. And at Christmas, I spent time showing my daughter\u2019s boyfriend \u201cCool Tools,\u201d with its advice on hitchhiking, finding the most practical stapler, renting a bulldozer or building an igloo. With a frantic, jam-packed design and improbable juxtapositions, it\u2019s a big, sprawling wonder of a book \u2014 half coffee-table tome and half Sears catalog of old. Having it in my hands made me happy. Cool Tools, both the website and the book, is not about getting more things, or expensive gadgets, but about finding the right stuff. For me, it was the $9 AccuSharp Knife Sharpener, remarkably useful because it makes something I already have \u2014 an indifferent set of kitchen knives \u2014 much more valuable. \u201cCool Tools\u201d is an artifact about other artifacts, but it is not pro-consumption \u2014 in fact, there is an ecstatic review about a book that extols the benefits of decluttering your life. At its best, \u201dCool Tools\u201d is a guide to getting that one true thing \u2014 a device, a piece of clothing, a tool \u2014 that will make daily life better. As practitioners of consumption, Americans lead poorly edited lives. We end up with basements and attics full of items that looked amazing in the store or online, but that lost their sparkle once they left the Bubble Wrap. \u201cCool Tools\u201d fits into a growing wave of the so-called maker culture, a movement toward building real, actual things with our own two hands. Mr. Kelly, who is often both grandiose and correct in his pronouncements, says he believes that a \u201cthird industrial revolution is stirring,\u201d adding that the stuff in his book is \u201caimed at small groups, decentralized communities, the do-it-yourselfer, and the self-educated.\u201d \u201cThese are tools to make us better humans,\u201d he said. Community workshops, with an array of tools and equipment for building things in metal and wood, are springing up and offering membership plans the way gyms do. Mr. Kelly points out that a new service allows people to drive their car to the airport and then rent it out while they are gone. The growing possibilities of 3-D printing are further democratizing the manufacturing process. Of course, believing we can consume our way to a better future is a very American impulse, but Mr. Kelly argues that \u201caccess to something is going to be far more important than actually owning it.\u201d He points to digital books and says that owning them will seem pass\u00e9 pretty quickly, predicting that Amazon and others will soon move to all-access memberships like Netflix. \u201cI am trying to maximize the number of great technologies that people have with which to express their creativity, but at the same time, I am trying to minimize the number of tools in my own life,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that function, of choosing what you actually need and can use, is going to get more and more complicated.\u201d The book, he says, \u201cis not a rejection of digital technology. We are just in the early days of what e-books are going to be and no one says that it is going to be a flat, one-size fits all device in the future. But for now, print seemed like the best way to go with this project.\u201d It wasn\u2019t easy. When he was getting the book printed, he received a call asking if his office had a loading dock. Mr. Kelly, who works from home, said hopefully, \u201cI have a garage.\u201d That, he was told, would not suffice, so he arranged for a book distributor to take delivery. Having spent much of his life online, Mr. Kelly is suddenly living in a very physical world. \u201cRight now, I have 70 metric tons of books headed my way on a ship,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to figure out where they were all going.\u201d Email: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter: @carr2n Kevin Kelly self-published a collection of reviews accrued from a website over the years, and it sold extremely well.",

Amazon\u2019s chief executive suffered a kidney stone attack visiting the Galapagos Islands this week, according to  the local press . A Navy helicopter plucked Mr. Bezos from a cruise ship and flew him to Baltra Island, which has one of the two Galapagos airports. His private plane then took him back to the United States. An Amazon spokesman, asked for comment, quoted Mr. Bezos as saying: \u201cGalapagos: five stars. Kidney stones: zero stars.\u201d Kidney stones form when there are elevated levels of certain substances in urine. They may be \u201cas small as a grain of sand or as large as a pearl. Some stones are even as big as golf balls,\u201d  the Mayo Clinic says . The bigger they are, the more pain they cause as they make their way through the urinary tract. While not usually a sign of serious problems, the stones \u2014 as well as Mr. Bezos\u2019s imminent 50th birthday \u2014 might spark some questions about a succession plan at Amazon.

        "name": "Make a Resolution to Budget? Here Are Some Apps to Help ",
        "content": " CORRECTION APPENDEDThere's something brilliant, but also insidious, about services like Amazon Prime, where you don't have to reach for your credit card to pay. Spending is painless. Credit cards have separated us from our cash. Services like Amazon Prime, iTunes and others have separated us from our cards. And once we can pay more easily with our smartphones, consumers will experience yet another degree of separation. All of this means that consumers need to work a bit harder to ''feel'' what they're spending -- and keep track of it. Behavioral scientists will tell you what you intuitively know: Willpower alone will take you only so far, and restrictive budgets eventually fail. But this is the time of year when many people try to get a grip on their spending. ''Look for structural solutions or things that change your environment so you don't need to be constantly vigilant,'' said Stephen Wendel, a behavioral social scientist at HelloWallet, which helps employers provide financial guidance to their workers. ''My favorite technology is the automatic transfer, so you don't see the money in your account.'' There are some new financial apps that try to acknowledge our innate weaknesses as humans, most of whom despise deprivation and keeping tabs on every last dollar spent. I spent the last week testing several cash management tools, including the newest apps targeting younger generations as well as improvements made by established services like Mint.com that still dominate the market. A note of caution: To use most of these apps and services, which promise bank-level security, you need to be comfortable entrusting them with the passwords to your financial accounts. To analyze your spending, they need to collect and then ferry data about your income and transactional history into their programs; many rely on established players like Yodlee and Intuit for that plumbing and do not have the ability to move your money. I've also listed a couple of more traditional, and more labor-intensive, options. LEVEL MONEY Less than three months old, this app is intentionally simple: You can't create fancy charts that categorize every last dollar, nor does it wag a virtual finger to alert you when you've spent too much on restaurants in the last month. Instead, it acts as a spending meter or a gas gauge: On the first of each month, it fills up with your estimated income based on your previous history; from that, the app automatically subtracts your recurring bills and a saving rate. (It suggests 7 percent). The app is available for iPhone and is coming soon for Android. The money remaining is what you can spend, and the app breaks that down on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. The app is connected to all of your credit, debit and banking accounts, so it knows every time you make a transaction and adjusts the money meter accordingly. If you had a day of heavy spending, it will show that you have less to spend for the remainder of the month. ''What we wanted wasn't a budget, but the digital equivalent of opening up your wallet and seeing how much you have left,'' said Jake Fuentes, 27, Level's co-founder and chief executive. The idea, Mr. Fuentes said, is to focus on decisions in the here and now. It's that simple -- and probably far too simple for many people. The app is geared to people 18 to 35 who are most likely to have less complex financial lives. You can't add in your cash transactions and the app won't work as well for people with inconsistent income and expenses, but the company is working on adding features that will address those issues. BILLGUARD This app started life as a security service that scanned users' credit and debit charges for potentially erroneous or unauthorized transactions -- a service Target shoppers can surely appreciate now. But last summer, it added a spending analytics tool and personalized savings alerts. The spending feature gives you a snapshot of your monthly spending, though you need be a heavy credit and debit card user for the numbers to have meaning. Every time you swipe a card, the transaction is automatically categorized. It did a relatively good job with the two cards I connected. The analytics are informative, but one-dimensional. You can compare spending across all accounts with the previous month. You can compare spending across all accounts with the prior month, but the app doesn't provide insights into spending relative to income. Those features and customizable alerts will be added in coming months. ''It will be looking out for you almost like the perfect accountant in the background, letting you live your life and when you go beyond a certain threshold it will let you know,'' said Yaron Samid, founder and chief executive. The company is also working on letting users add cash transactions, alerts when users are close to incurring an overdraft fee, and other analytics. The app, which is available for the iPhone and will serve Android in February, also searches the Web for coupons that you are most likely to use based on your past spending. The app works for two linked accounts, but there's a one-time charge of $9.99 for up to 10 accounts. Yodlee handles account aggregation. MINT For several years now, I have had an on-again, off-again relationship with Mint.com, the automated money-tracking service introduced in 2007 and acquired in 2009 by Intuit for $170 million. If you want to get a better sense of where your money is going, keep tabs on your net worth and chart it all with pie and bar charts for different time periods, then Mint is still the most comprehensive tool on the market. LearnVest, which offers a human financial planner if you want one, has a similarly robust free tool, which I've reviewed in the past. Mint's budgeting tool sets up a starter budget for you -- based on up to three months' spending history -- across various categories from groceries to mobile phones. You can add to the list and customize to your heart's content. If you spend more than you've allotted, you can set it up to receive an email or a text message. LearnVest has its own budgeting tool, which also provides some guideposts: You should spend no more than half of your income on essentials and no more than 30 percent on lifestyle expenses. Mint users, estimated at two million by the company, can now track their spending, income and net worth via the mobile app, but people will inevitably find something that doesn't quite work for them. The app requires maintenance because its categorization is not flawless. It still irks me that Mint refuses to learn that the target-date mutual fund in my 401(k) is not Target, the retailer. The app is available for Android and Apple. YOU NEED A BUDGET This budgeting program requires you to enter or import everything manually, though much of that can be done by syncing the program with its app. If you are reluctant to hand over passwords to your financial accounts, this could be a good option. You can give it a test run for 34 days. After that, it will cost $60 for the program. The idea behind its method: Give every dollar a job. The program does seem geared for dedicated, disciplined self-starters who don't mind spending a chunk of time each week going over their spending. Tim Maurer, a financial planner in Hunt Valley, Md., makes time for it, and feels he's better connected to his family's spending patterns as a result. ''I do still use Mint occasionally, just to act as a one-stop dashboard of all my financial accounts, but it's really only casual use,'' Mr. Maurer said. ''Y.N.A.B. I use religiously, going through our household's weekly spending every Saturday morning. I load all my transactions and review my balances through the software on my laptop -- and then my wife and I reference the Y.N.A.B. iPhone app throughout the week.'' The program and its apps are available for Apple and Android. MVELOPES This program tries to modernize your parents' or grandparents' envelope system, where you allocate money to various envelopes for different categories, like food. The idea is that when there's no money left, you either stop spending in that category or pull money from another envelope. The tool, which is available for Android and iPhone, automatically connects to your accounts with its own technology, though you have the option of entering transactions manually. While I found the envelope concept alluring, I didn't find the service at all intuitive and could not connect a Citibank account to the system. Creating up to 25 envelopes and adding four accounts is free, and includes a free phone session with a money coach (the service sells these sessions, too, but they aren't necessarily with financial planners or accountants). Unlimited service costs $9.95 monthly. OTHER APPS AND SERVICES Dozens of other apps will help you track your money, from Spendee ($1.99 on an iPhone; it is coming to Android soon) to Bdgt ($1.99), both of which have been featured by the Apple app store. But they are really just electronic notebooks, requiring manual entry, that make tracking your spending easy to categorize. If you just want to raise your consciousness for a few weeks or months, you might try something like Spendee, which is easy to use and pleasing to look at, and can back up data to iCloud and export it if you wish. Even Jim Bruene, founder of the NetBanker blog who tracks innovations in personal finance technology, can appreciate old-school methods for a period of time. ''Diligently hand-entering every expense for a month or two can be eye-opening, at least for the more short-term scenario where you are trying to get a handle on what's happening with all your cash,'' he said. But that'll require some willpower. Correction: January 8, 2014, Wednesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Your Money column on Saturday, about apps to help budgeters keep track of spending, gave outdated information on the BillGuard app's availability for the iPhone. It is available now; it will not be out in February. The column also misstated the price of the Bdgt app. It costs $1.99; it is not free. Level Money's smartphone application, left and center, is aimed at adults under 35. It subtracts expenditures and indicates what's left. BillGuard, right, shows spending by amount and location.

Except in the case of the title track, which has been available since Nov. 25, the loophole was closed quickly, but the album appeared on several file-sharing sites within hours.

Included are several new studio recordings of favorites from Mr. Springsteen's concert sets, with Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine joining Mr. Springsteen on guitar, along with earlier studio outtakes including Mr. Springsteen's longtime saxophonist, Clarence Clemons, who died in 2011.

        "content": " It is time again for DealBook\u2019s annual \u201cClosing Dinner,\u201d at which we toast and roast the world of finance and corporations \u2014 and look back at the year that was. This year\u2019s table assignments were a bit trickier than in years past. Eric Holder, the United States attorney general, asked to sit next to Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase to \u201ccatch up on some unfinished business.\u201d Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, asked to sit next to Mr. Holder as well but also \u201cwithin earshot of Steven Cohen.\u201d Then, out of the blue, Carl Icahn, the activist investor, tweeted that he hoped to sit next to Tim Cook of Apple. Mr. Cook, presumably having tired of Mr. Icahn\u2019s one-track conversations, replied with \u201c#SeatCarlWithBillAckman.\u201d We might sell tickets to that table. We sent an invitation to Jeff Bezos, but U.P.S. didn\u2019t deliver it in time over the holiday. If only Amazon\u2019s new drones were up and flying. Edward Snowden, who could not leave Russia for obvious reasons, sent his regrets along with a note he asked me to give to Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook: \u201cThose emails with your mother before the holidays were really cute.\u201d It\u2019s also nice to see Elon Musk, who just arrived, of course, in his Tesla. He has offered to cook dessert, which he promises will be a surprise flamb\u00e9. (Rimshot, please!) And Jamie, before I forget, a nice young gentleman from China asked me to pass you his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but I\u2019m not sure who his parents are. Please don\u2019t hold it against him. (Ouch! I jest.) A big thanks to the Winklevoss twins, who were kind enough to pay for tonight\u2019s festivities in Bitcoin. Dick Costolo of Twitter also chipped in by paying with his company\u2019s stock. As a token of our thanks, there\u2019s bubble gum and tulips in all of your gift bags. Finally, before we begin the official toasts and roasts, we are lucky to have Pope Francis here, especially given his recent critical comments about capitalism and those \u201cwielding economic power.\u201d We sat him next to Donald Trump. Now, in all seriousness: SIMPLY, THANK YOU Ben Bernanke: Please take a bow as you prepare to depart the Federal Reserve as chairman. Everyone in the nation owes you a huge thanks. You have done an extraordinary job helping the country get out of a deep recession with little help from gridlocked officials in Washington. We still have a long way to go, but considering the economic abyss we were facing five years ago \u2014 and the unconventional steps you have taken over the years to reduce the unemployment rate \u2014 it is a minor miracle we are not in worse shape. Your first steps this month to taper the government\u2019s bond-buying program appear to be working. Of course, there\u2019s an argument to be made that some of your easy-money policies may have exacerbated inequality in the nation \u2014 most of the wealth generated over the last couple of years has accrued to those already with assets like homes or stocks \u2014 but it surely kept the economy from collapsing. And if you ever think your actions weren\u2019t appreciated enough, just think of the blunt bumper sticker that former Representative Barney Frank once joked he was going to buy, effectively saying: Things Would Have Been Worse Without Me. Your successor, Janet Yellen, has some big shoes to fill. WORST C.E.O. OF THE YEAR This year\u2019s prize for worst chief executive was a tie between Ron Johnson, who was ousted from J. C. Penney, and Thorsten Heins, who exited BlackBerry. Admittedly, both executives had tough turnaround assignments when they got the jobs. But both found novel ways to run their companies into the ground at breakneck speeds. Mr. Johnson, who made his name building Apple\u2019s retail business and liked to not-so-subtly compare himself to Steve Jobs, made the early \u2014 and patently wrong \u2014 decision to jettison Penney\u2019s longtime customers in favor of catering to more upscale customers who never showed up. Mr. Heins\u2019s reign at BlackBerry was doomed from almost the first week he took the job when he declared, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the company as it exists right now,\u201d even though anyone with an iPhone or Android sensed trouble. And then, rather than introduce the first model of BlackBerry\u2019s next-generation phone with a keyboard \u2014 the reason so many of its customers were loyal for so long \u2014 he introduced a keyboardless version. BANK C.E.O. OF THE YEAR It\u2019s not very popular to crown a \u201cC.E.O. of the Year\u201d these days, and even less so the chief of a big bank, but James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, deserves credit for turning around an institution that only a couple of years ago was on the verge of being written off. Mr. Gorman, a straight-talking former consultant from Australia, got the bank out of its riskiest businesses, was perhaps the most vocal about tamping down compensation and refocused the firm on the staid, perhaps even boring, business of wealth management. In the process, he may have taken Morgan Stanley out of competing head-to-head with the likes of Goldman Sachs \u2014 an assumption he would challenge and some old-timers would lament \u2014 but the firm\u2019s turnaround has been a success.

THE GANG THAT COULDN\u2019T SHOOT STRAIGHT FINALLY DID One of the refrains we hear again and again from the business community is that Washington is creating unneeded uncertainty with its series of debt default threats and government shutdowns. It\u2019s not clear that praise deserves to be heaped on those who simply do their jobs, but since it seemingly happens so rarely in Washington, praise is in order to both Paul Ryan and Patty Murray for reaching a mini-budget deal without blowing up the economy again. It wasn\u2019t a grand bargain, but it was a step in the right direction. Icahn Amps Up Pressure on Apple, but His Stake Limits His  Leverage Icahn Reviews Dinner on  Twitter",

        "content": " SEATTLE \u2014 The world\u2019s biggest online retailer has mastered the art of talking a lot about its holiday sales, while saying very little. For years, Amazon has blasted out a press release, a day or so after Christmas, filled with a string of tantalizing-sounding factoids about the holidays at Amazon without actually providing a very meaningful picture of its business. In 2010, Amazon said customers ordered more than 13.7 million items on the site\u2019s peak sales day, Nov. 29 \u2014 \u201ca record-breaking 158 items per second\u201d \u2014 we were told in one  typical release   from the company. No word on how many of those \u201citems\u201d were paper clips and how many were plasma television sets. The 2013  edition   of Amazon\u2019s holiday bragfest was surprising because it actually told many of the professionals who follow the company something they actually wanted to know, even if Amazon did it in the most cryptic way possible. In a quote in its press release, Jeffrey Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, said: \u201cAmazon Prime membership continues to grow, and we now have tens of millions of members worldwide.\u201d Amazon Prime is the company\u2019s $79-a-year membership service, which provides people with free two-day shipping and a list of other benefits. By all estimates, it has been a big hit for the company. Still, Amazon has never said how many Prime members it has, leaving Wall Street analysts to make educated guesses about just how many people are paying the annual fee for the service, which is crucial to Amazon\u2019s strategy for increasing retail sales, building a video service to compete with Netflix and other ambitions. Of course, \u201ctens of millions of members\u201d leaves a lot to the imagination. Still, that choice of words clearly implies that Prime membership is north of 20 million accounts, higher than the 16 million to 18 million some analysts had estimated. Amazon also said it added more than a million new Prime customers during the third week of December. Amazon\u2019s new spirit of transparency did not, however, extend to its Kindle family of devices, the total sales of which are still shrouded in mystery. How many of the devices did Amazon sell this year? The company said only that \u201cmillions of customers unwrapped Kindle e-readers and Kindle Fire tablets this holiday season.\u201d Amazon Floats the Notion of Delivery  Drones Amazon Raises Threshold for Free  Shipping The Price of  Amazon Amazon Starts a Shopping Site for the Environmental  Crowd Questions for Amazon on Privacy and the Kindle  Fire Amazon said that there are \u201ctens of millions of members\u201d of its Prime service, which provides people with free two-day shipping and a list of other benefits. | Ross D.

        "content": " A blue BMW crossed the cracked parking lot and rolled to a stop outside a tired-looking Macy\u2019s. The passenger door opened, and out sprang John Donahoe, the chief executive of eBay, who began striding toward the store. It was earlier this year, and from the outside the Westfield Valley Fair mall near San Jose had a kind of ghost-town feel to it. But Donahoe thinks he can change that. As he walked from store to store \u2014 a nearly empty GNC, a quiet Foot Locker \u2014 he pointed out how little had changed in physical retail stores over the last 30 or 40 years and what would have to change in the next few years in order for these stores to compete with Amazon and Walmart. As he sat in a patisserie on the mall\u2019s ground floor, Donahoe touched on his usual themes: how technology has driven scale and automation; how the big-box retailers have crushed Main Street; the way in which our shopping experiences have become less dependent on human interaction. And these changes in the commercial landscape, he said, tend to be \u2018\u2018phrased in zero-sum terms: big retailers versus the little guy. Local versus global. The Chinese imports will kill you. Online is going to disrupt offline.\u2019\u2019 There has been much talk about Amazon driving retailers out of business \u2014 most recently, and somewhat unbelievably, by proposing to use drones to deliver purchases. For some time now, physical retailers have lived in fear of the various ways in which Amazon can undercut them. If you\u2019re looking for a product that you don\u2019t need to try on or try out, Amazon\u2019s customer analytics and nationwide network of 40-plus enormous fulfillment centers is awfully tough to compete with. And even if you do need to try something on, Amazon conveniently includes a bar-code scanner in its mobile application so you can compare prices while you\u2019re in a store and then have the same item shipped to your home with just a few clicks. (Retailers call this act of checking out products in a store and then buying them online from a different vendor \u2018\u2018showrooming.\u2019\u2019) Amazon holds such sway that for many it\u2019s the default place to buy things online. And yet online commerce currently accounts for only about 6 percent of all commerce in the United States. We still buy more than 90 percent of everything we purchase offline, often by handing over money or swiping a credit card in exchange for the goods we want. But the proliferation of smartphones and tablets has increasingly led to the use of digital technology to help us make those purchases, and it\u2019s in that convergence that eBay sees its opportunity. As Donahoe puts it: \u2018\u2018We view it actually as and. Not online, not offline: Both.\u2019\u2019 Most people think of eBay as an online auction house, the world\u2019s biggest garage sale, which it has been for most of its life. But since Donahoe took over in 2008, he has slowly moved the company beyond auctions, developing technology partnerships with big retailers like Home Depot, Macy\u2019s, Toys \u2018\u2018R\u2019\u2019 Us and Target and expanding eBay\u2019s online marketplace to include reliable, returnable goods at fixed prices. (Auctions currently represent just 30 percent of the purchases made at eBay.com; the site sells 13,000 cars a week through its mobile app alone, many at fixed prices.) Under Donahoe, eBay has made 34 acquisitions over the last five years, most of them to provide the company and its retail partners with enhanced technology. EBay can help with the back end of websites, create interactive storefronts in real-world locations, streamline the electronic-payment process or help monitor inventory in real time. (Outsourcing some of the digital strategy and technological operations to eBay frees up companies to focus on what they presumably do best: Make and market their own products.) In select cities, eBay has also recently introduced eBay Now, an app that allows you to order goods from participating local vendors and have them delivered to your door in about an hour for a $5 fee. The company is betting its future on the idea that its interactive technology can turn shopping into a kind of entertainment, or at least make commerce something more than simply working through price-plus-shipping calculations. If eBay can get enough people into Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods to try out a new set of golf clubs and then get them to buy those clubs in the store, instead of from Amazon, there\u2019s a business model there. A key element of eBay\u2019s vision of the future is the digital wallet. On a basic level, having a \u2018\u2018digital wallet\u2019\u2019 means paying with your phone, but it\u2019s about a lot more than that; it\u2019s as much a concept as a product. EBay bought PayPal in 2002, after PayPal established itself as a safe way to transfer money between people who didn\u2019t know each other (thus facilitating eBay purchases). For the last several years, eBay has regarded digital payments through mobile devices as having the potential to change everything \u2014 to become, as David Marcus, PayPal\u2019s president, puts it, \u2018\u2018Money 3.0.\u2019\u2019 EBay\u2019s current iteration of Money 3.0 sits on the third floor of a low-rise building on Sixth Avenue in the Flatiron district of Manhattan, in a series of spaces that the company calls the Commerce Innovation Showcase. A \u2018\u2018brand ambassador\u2019\u2019 named Josh Beyers led me on a tour through them earlier this year. As he moved from a model living room to a model toy store to a model cafe, the PayPal mobile app served as a kind of virtual key that unlocked everything that you might want to do in places like these. Once Beyers \u2018\u2018checked in\u2019\u2019 through the app at the toy store, for example, he was able to retrieve a purchase that he made earlier on the eBay website without ever having to remove his phone from his pocket. At the cafe, Beyers\u2019s sandwich \u2014 which he ordered earlier from his phone, down to the condiments \u2014 was ready for him when he arrived. The app also saved his preferences, so he could order the same thing again later without having to repeat the process. His picture popped up on the point-of-sale system at the cafe, and the \u2018\u2018clerk\u2019\u2019 verified who he was and then handed him his sandwich. At a model stadium, he entered with a digital ticket \u2014 StubHub, the online-ticket-resale vendor, was acquired by eBay several years ago \u2014 and was able to have food delivered to his seat and a souvenir jersey sent to his home that same day, even though the in-stadium store was sold out. There was a hokey Potemkin village feel to the whole show, but the seamlessness of the personalization was striking. When you shop online \u2014 when you do anything online, as we are all supposed to know by now \u2014 you\u2019re being tracked. Sites know who you are, when you\u2019re there, how you got there, what pages you clicked on, how long you stayed on each page and in some instances exactly where and for how long your cursor hovered as you tried to make up your mind. Online companies collect all of this information and use it. Offline retailers \u2014 physical stores \u2014 do not have these advantages. They don\u2019t know who you are unless you use your card to buy something, and that\u2019s only after the fact. They can\u2019t target you or make you any kind of specific offer, as online retailers can. The technology on display in eBay\u2019s Commerce Innovation Showcase is designed to try to close that gap. EBay can\u2019t claim to be the only one capable of bringing this vision to life. Along with others, Walmart is also making the move into digital retailing as fast as it can in an effort to compete with Amazon \u2014 and in a much more direct way. Walmart\u2019s reputation in Silicon Valley is for a kind of old-school efficiency: getting pallets of goods (often from China) into a big-box store in America and then into the hands of its customers, all for very low prices. There are more than 200 million visits to its stores every week. But until fairly recently, Walmart\u2019s online search engine was having trouble doing something as simple as identifying what visitors wanted when they searched for \u2018\u2018denim.\u2019\u2019 And so two years ago the company opened @WalmartLabs, in Silicon Valley, where 1,500 people now work. There are an additional 1,000 people around the world dedicated solely to e-commerce. All of Walmart\u2019s stores are now \u2018\u2018geofenced\u2019\u2019 \u2014 that is, they know when individual customers are in the store, thanks to the Walmart app on their phones that can guide them to what they want. In roughly 220 of Walmart\u2019s 4,000 locations, customers can make their purchases with their telephones, bypassing registers (and their lines) altogether. \u2018\u2018People know Walmart as the world\u2019s largest retailer, but they\u2019re going to know us as one of the largest and fastest-growing e-commerce companies,\u2019\u2019 Neil Ashe, the head of global e-commerce at Walmart, said. This is corporate messaging, to be sure, but it also reflects a very real shift in strategy. Ashe has said elsewhere that turning Walmart into a digital retailer is not just a project but a permanent part of its future as a business. \u201cPeople expect Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us to act like Amazon,\u2019\u2019 said Christopher Saridakis, who heads eBay Enterprise, \u2018\u2018but they don\u2019t realize how hard it is.\u2019\u2019 He was preparing to show me around a 543,000-square-foot fulfillment center in a remote corporate complex in Walton, Ky. What he meant was that Amazon has conditioned consumers to expect an ease to online shopping \u2014 a few clicks, desired items always in stock, free two-day shipping and returns \u2014 that physical retailers have a hard time competing with. EBay Enterprise, which was known as GSI Commerce when eBay purchased it in 2011, now drives eBay\u2019s effort to enable its larger retail partners to meet the same expectations. Saridakis referred to the facility in Walton as \u2018\u2018the other side of the computer\u2019\u2019: When we press \u2018\u2018buy\u2019\u2019 on the websites of Levi\u2019s or A\u00e9ropostale or Quicksilver or PBS or Major League Baseball, whose products are all warehoused in Walton, that purchase often becomes a package bound from Walton for your door. Five miles of conveyor belts feed into a double-tilt tray sorter that dumps individually wrapped goods into the appropriate chutes at one end of the facility and then packed-and-stamped boxes onto ramps that lead directly into UPS trucks at the other. Almost 200,000 products from nearly 600,000 unique locations within the facility make their way via human pickers and machine sorters into the proper packages and off to the people who want them. EBay Enterprise also helps retailers rethink and reorganize how they use their physical stores. Increasingly, retailers are starting to regard their stores as small-scale distribution centers for their products, as nodes in the fulfillment process as well as showrooms. If you live in Manhattan and you order Beanie Babies online from Toys \u2018\u2018R\u2019\u2019 Us, sometimes it makes more economic sense for an employee at a local Toys \u2018\u2018R\u2019\u2019 Us to pack and ship that order than it does to have the fulfillment center in Kentucky do it. This takes an enormous amount of integrated technology to orchestrate, but it\u2019s also the only way to compete with Amazon: using everything from physical stores to mobile applications to delivery services to make sure that customers can get what they want when they want it. Walmart is doing some of the same things: building million-square-foot online-only warehouses and experimenting with using stores as distribution centers. The company is now shipping goods directly from roughly 35 of its 4,000 stores. While this process is about efficiently moving goods, the deeper purpose is to improve and manage the relationship with the customer. Healey Cypher, the head of retail innovation at eBay, tells a story about a bookseller who was convinced that online commerce would kill his business: \u2018\u2018I said to him: \u2018How do you know when someone\u2019s in your store? You don\u2019t, unless they bought something, and then only after the purchase. What if you had a platform for the first time ever that said, \u2018\u2018This person is in your store, they like these things, they bought these things on your web store, and here\u2019s an offer you should give them based on their purchases\u2019\u2019? You don\u2019t have to take it, but you\u2019ve never had that opportunity before.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 The best current example of the digital wallet\u2019s promise, according to many in Silicon Valley, is Uber, a digital platform that connects riders and drivers. You enter your credit-card information into the Uber app once, and then every time you want to use it, the app knows where you are and shows you how many cars are nearby and how soon one can be available. You order with one touch on a mobile screen, and a text lets you know a driver is on the way and then another tells you when he\u2019s near. He greets you by name, you tell him where you want to go and then, when you are dropped off, there is no further exchange \u2014 no tip, no receipt, no signing anything. The app takes care of all that for you. Uber didn\u2019t change anything about the nature of cars or how they are driven. It just figured out how to use data and technology to make what was out there work much more efficiently. (EBay, through its acquisition of the company Shutl, has begun to exploit a similar inefficiency in the spare capacity of courier companies.) In this fashion, services can become both frictionless and more personal to you. Imagine that everything functioned as Uber does. Steve Yankovich, the vice president of innovation and new ventures at eBay, often asks people to do just that in order to envision eBay\u2019s plans for the future. Imagine that, when you walk into a store,  you could look at your mobile device and see everything currently available in your size there. Instead of having to stuff the \u2018\u2018buy nine sandwiches, get the 10th sandwich free\u2019\u2019 cards from various merchants into your wallet, suppose every 10th sandwich showed up free without your having to do anything at all. Ditto your frequent-flier information and every other affinity or rewards program. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not about payment,\u2019\u2019 Jack Dorsey, a founder of Square, a PayPal competitor, says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s about identity. And it\u2019s about the experience that a merchant can create, which is what actually builds loyalty. We believe that it\u2019s important that the technology, the mechanics of payments, actually fade away to the background. They disappear completely.\u2019\u2019 After helping found Twitter in 2006, Dorsey became chief executive of Square in 2009. Its initial innovation was the Square Reader, a small device that plugs into the headphone jack of a smartphone or tablet and enables anyone, anywhere, to process a credit-card payment. (PayPal now has a similar reader.) In 2011, Square introduced what would become known as the Square Wallet, an app that links to a credit card (as Uber does) and allows consumers to pay either by holding their phones up to a scanner or, in some cases, simply by having the phones on in their pockets. Dorsey talks about how cool it is to get your coffee without having to do anything, but he also emphasizes what it means for the merchants. \u2018\u2018The seller gets this very interesting tool,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018They can recognize me when I walk in.\u2019\u2019 The idea is that, someday not too far off from now, you\u2019ll store everything in your digital wallet that you currently store in your old leather one \u2014 including your driver\u2019s license, health-insurance information, all of it. We\u2019ve all gone out for the night and not wanted to bring a bulky wallet, so we grab our phone, our license, a credit card and $20 and head out the door. The digital wallet, if it develops to its potential, will make the license and the credit card redundant, and eventually also the $20. It\u2019s hard to predict who will prevail in any sector of the tech world, but PayPal does have some advantages. This year Square processed more than $20 billion in payments \u2014 mostly through its card readers, not the wallet \u2014 but PayPal has 137 million active users, and millions of them have downloaded the PayPal app. PayPal\u2019s head start has enabled it to create a greater variety of payment options than other companies offer. It doesn\u2019t just link to a credit card. It\u2019s set up more like a bank: through it, you can make payments with any of your credit cards or a debit card, have the amount withdrawn directly from your checking account or even finance the purchase through a line of credit with PayPal itself. And for up to a week after you\u2019ve made a purchase, you can choose how you want to pay for it. Almost anybody can build a digital wallet. The trick is getting people to entrust that wallet with their financial information and then to offer them enough benefits that they\u2019ll use it. Of course there\u2019s a catch \u2014 or, really, a series of catches. The first is that there\u2019s not much genuine demand for the digital wallet. Even Hill Ferguson, PayPal\u2019s chief product officer, says, \u2018\u2018The digital wallet is the linchpin for everything we do, but it\u2019s interesting, because consumers aren\u2019t asking for them.\u2019\u2019 People who don\u2019t work at corporations that have a financial interest in digital wallets are even more direct. Sucharita Mulpuru, a vice president with Forrester Research who specializes in online commerce and consumer behavior, says: \u2018\u2018Digital wallets, at this point in time, are solutions looking for problems. We don\u2019t fundamentally have friction in payments in the U.S. People who want to use cash are using cash for a reason: They prefer to or they don\u2019t want to be traced. As for credit cards, there is not something fundamentally inconvenient about them. They\u2019re fast, they\u2019re reliable, our networks are good.\u2019\u2019 She has also been watching a start-up called Coin, which is basically one card with a magnetic strip that can store any swipable card that you have. At the point of sale you can pick one by pressing a button on the card. This requires no change whatsoever in consumer behavior. (PayPal has issued a card, together with Discover, for much the same reason: some people aren\u2019t quite ready to make the leap to purely digital transactions.) Credit cards really are pretty easy. And if you\u2019re paying with your phone, what do you do if you run out of batteries or if the network is down? The credit-card network rarely falters, and it is ubiquitous; as of now, there are very few places that look anything like the Commerce Innovation Showcase. Another catch is that the \u2018\u2018personalization\u2019\u2019 envisioned by the pioneers of the digital wallet isn\u2019t really all that personal, and in many ways the process benefits retailers more than it does consumers. Entering a store that happens to be geofenced and receiving notifications on your phone based on who you are and where you\u2019re standing \u2014 does anybody truly want that? The same can be asked of mobile coupons meant to pull people into stores. The lack of demand for this stuff right now suggests that consumers aren\u2019t so sure. Having a clerk you don\u2019t know identify you by your picture on a point-of-sale system and then hand you your macchiato isn\u2019t much of a personal interaction. Yes, you might be addressed by name, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to get to know the clerk. People at PayPal and Square rhapsodize about the bygone era of 50 or 100 years ago when you went to a general store in which the owner knew your name and you had an account and simply took what you wanted and then settled up at some later date. But it\u2019s a purposefully na\u00efve reading of an idealized past that most of us never experienced. \u2018\u2018We use newly coined ideas of authenticity to attempt to hold on to something we can\u2019t quite articulate that might have been lost in the course of becoming modern,\u2019\u2019 Jaron Lanier, a well-known computer scientist and technology expert, writes in his recent book, \u2018\u2018Who Owns the Future?\u2019\u2019 There are also privacy concerns. Consumers have to be willing to share information about themselves \u2014 their location, their preferences \u2014 in order for the software to do its job. With the recent revelations that the government has been watching us more thoroughly than we ever knew, that has become a tougher sell than it once was. Security and the risk of identity theft pose challenges, too. The hope, according to David Marcus of PayPal, is that biometric technologies \u2014 for example, the fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5s \u2014 will eventually become ubiquitous and create the sense of security that people need to make the leap to mobile-only transactions. In general, Silicon Valley tends to be overly optimistic about how fast new technologies and behaviors will be adopted. Payment companies talk about making the transition to digital payments within the next three to five years, but Mulpuru says she thinks it\u2019s going to be at least 10 years before people are ready to accept such a radically new way of doing things. In some ways, the future is already here. At City Winery in New York City right now, you can use your PayPal app to track your bill in real time as you eat and drink and then pay it (including the gratuity) on your phone without having to wait for the server. (Ferguson, who\u2019s in charge of PayPal\u2019s digital wallet, says that the early results indicate that diners leave bigger tips when they don\u2019t have to wait for the check.) And maybe it is better if our phones can work quietly from our pockets instead of drawing our attention away from others. \u2018\u2018I think technology is at its best when it reminds us that we already have everything we need,\u2019\u2019 Jack Dorsey says. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m excited when technology disappears more and we\u2019re using what we already have. This whole trend of moving from a keyboard and a mouse to actually using our fingers, our voice.\u2019\u2019 We carry our phones with us everywhere today, but that doesn\u2019t mean we will in a few years. The strategy of the future isn\u2019t necessarily about your phone. It\u2019s about your phone as another intelligent screen. EBay and Square and retailers trying to compete with Amazon have to try to take advantage of every new technology because that seems to be the best way to avoid being squashed. Amazon is so big, has so many distribution centers and offers so much ease of use that in some sense it has already won \u2014 unless its competitors can find new ways to bring the convenience and connectivity of online interaction to the physical retail world. But even John Donahoe hesitates to predict exactly what facets of the digital wallet, or of the technologies that eBay is trying to deliver to its retail partners, will take off. Maybe a \u2018\u2018smart\u2019\u2019 mirror in a store, which takes your measurements and allows you to try on several outfits virtually and then purchase them from the screen itself, will catch on; maybe it won\u2019t. (EBay has been experimenting with a concept it calls Connected Glass, and the company says it\u2019s much less gimmicky than it sounds. Right now eBay uses it mostly to create interactive digital storefronts in physical locations like a mall or an unused building, but Yankovich says that someday we\u2019ll pull up to a drive-through and order by touching the connected screen embedded in our driver-side windows.) Maybe eBay will find itself fabricating things via 3-D printing, instead of simply facilitating sales. Maybe you\u2019ll be able to use your camera to take a panoramic scan of your surroundings and then tap on any item in the image and look up all kinds of things about it, from its cost to its user manual. In five years, digital wallets may well be a part of how we live, but they might also remain the province of the same early adopters who bought Segways. The recent rise of Bitcoin proves how fast things can change. Nobody\u2019s going to use a PayPal digital wallet just because John Donahoe wants them to. Many people at eBay said the exact same thing, as if singing from the same sheet: \u2018\u2018The consumer leads; the technology enables.\u2019\u2019 A good tagline, but it\u2019s also true. If you don\u2019t like it, if it doesn\u2019t give you something you don\u2019t want to live without, you won\u2019t use it. \u2018\u2018I would say everything we\u2019re doing is just enabling the future,\u2019\u2019 Donahoe said, as we wrapped up our interview at the Westfield mall. The slow trickle of midday mall traffic eased past us. He sounded confident, even if the future was a little hard to see from where we were sitting.

        "content": " And Highlights Q. I know how to make notes and highlights in the text of a Kindle e-book, but how do you get all the annotations out of the book file for use elsewhere? A. Amazon's website stores copies of all the notes and highlights you make in the e-books on your Kindle. To see a list of marked passages and virtual margin notes for each book, log in at kindle.amazon.com with your Amazon username and password, then click on ''Your Highlights'' at the top of the page. On the Your Highlights page, you can see a list of all your Kindle books -- with all the highlighted passages and personal notes in each one displayed. From here, you can cut and paste the material into a word-processing document, Evernote file or other program you use to stash text. As explained on the Kindle's Frequently Asked Questions page, Amazon also offers the option to share your online notes publicly with other Kindle users. The company also anonymously lists the passages frequently highlighted by other readers -- and the most highlighted passages of all time. If you are using a black-and-white Kindle, you may be able to copy the ''My Clippings.txt'' file (which stores your e-book annotations) to your computer, where you can copy it into another program. To do so, connect the Kindle to the computer with its USB cable, browse to the Documents folder and drag a copy of the ''My Clippings.txt'' file to your hard drive. Safely Cleaning The TV Screen Q. What's the best way to clean a flat-panel HDTV LCD screen? A. Check the manual or online support site for your television to get specific instructions, but definitely do not use Windex or other household cleaning solutions. Many cleaning products contain ammonia, alcohol or other chemicals that could damage the coating on the flat-panel screen. Even paper towels may cause scratches, so many manufacturers recommend using a soft, lint-free microfiber cleaning cloth to gently wipe down the screen. Some new televisions even include a cleaning cloth in the box, but if you have misplaced it, you can find microfiber wipes at electronics and camera stores. Some manufacturers advise slightly dampening the cleaning cloth with water -- or a highly diluted solution of water and mild dish soap for really dirty screens. Commercial kits that include the microfiber cloth and a cleaning solution meant for LCD screens are another option. In many cases, however, these can cost $10 to $20 to do the same job as a $2 microfiber cloth and a dash of water. TIP OF THE WEEK Thanks to the notifications feature built into iOS, iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches can keep you up to date with alerts from your favorite apps and news sites. If you would like a little peace and quiet from audible notifications during the overnight hours or even during meetings (or naps), you can temporarily silence them all with the Do Not Disturb feature built into iOS 6 and later. To set up Do Not Disturb in iOS 7, tap the Settings icon on the Home screen and then tap Do Not Disturb. In iOS 6, tap the Settings icon, then Notifications and then Do Not Disturb. Here, you can schedule regular hours without alerts (like 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. for a good night's sleep) while allowing FaceTime calls and messages from specific contacts. In iOS 7, Do Not Disturb can also be turned on and off manually by swiping up from the bottom of the screen to call up the Control Center and tapping the moon icon. Apple has more on using Do Not Disturb at support.apple.com/kb/HT5463. J. D. BIERSDORFER Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to  QandA@nytimes.com.

        "content": " If there were a prize for not blinking at the facts, it would go to Cloudera. The company, a maker of data management software, said on Wednesday that it would offer its business-class software on the public computing cloud. Until now, Cloudera had sold its software into private systems, either on its own or through resellers. The move is another  acknowledgment of the growing power   of public clouds, which are ways that companies and individuals can rent vast amounts of computing power, data storage and software over the Internet. In addition, it\u2019s an admission by Cloudera that the company needs to take its products to a place where they could conceivably help a competitor. Cloudera makes for big data analysis based on an open source project called Hadoop. Cloudera contributes to Hadoop but charges for the products it builds for itself. Amazon Web Services has released some of its own big data products this year, making it something of a Cloudera competitor. \u201cPeople need to deploy their big data analysis systems where they have their data,\u201d said Mike Olson, Cloudera\u2019s chief strategy officer. \u201cIncreasingly, that is the public cloud.\u201d He added: \u201cWe could go to others, like Microsoft or Google, but if you want market share, you\u2019re going to Amazon.\u201d Cloudera charges customers based on the number of servers using its software, a pricing model that should work tolerably well on Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S. Mr. Olson is hoping that the ease with which people can rent more servers on A.W.S. means he\u2019ll make even more, at least at first. \u201cMore engines on the same data load is going to win,\u201d he said. He praised A.W.S. for the way it had \u201cdemocratized\u201d some of the more expensive parts of big data analysis, but also said that A.W.S. can add features and services that will enter Cloudera\u2019s turf. \u201cDo we end up overlapping? That may happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be crazy not to be a part of this \u2013 those guys are a force of nature. We want to work with the best companies that have the best infrastructure.\u201d In a statement accompanying a Cloudera news release about the collaboration between the two companies, Terry Wise, a director of partnerships at Amazon Web Services, said the deal offered customers more choice of products. \u201cCustomers will have access to a leading Hadoop implementation,\u201d he said. Amazon declined to provide any further comment on the move. That kind of restraint all but signals a battle for features, functionality and lower prices somewhere down the line.

        "name": "Amazon faces protest by Germans on home turf; Workers try to enlist aid of U.S. unions with rally at retailer\u2019s headquarters ",
        "content": " Amazon employees in Germany have been battling the retailer with a series of wildcat strikes, most recently at the end of November. These protests, involving hundreds of Amazon workers at two fulfillment centers, have been the first strikes against the e-commerce leader anywhere in the world. On Monday the strikers are hoping to increase the pressure by taking the battle to the retailer\u2019s Seattle headquarters. A rally was scheduled for midmorning, with the organizers hoping to draw in local union workers as well as sympathetic members of the public. Technology companies, including Amazon, are getting ever richer and more powerful, but there seems to be a bit of a backlash developing. In San Francisco last week, protesters briefly blocked a Google bus transporting workers to its Silicon Valley campus. Amazon\u2019s announcement two weeks ago on the American news program \u2018\u201860 Minutes\u2019\u2019 that it was pursuing delivery by drones inspired not admiration but widespread mockery. Amazon, critics said, was dwelling in fantasyland. Perhaps Amazon started talking about drones as a form of wish fulfillment. For the retailer, the moment when machines prepare and deliver packages could not come too soon. Germany is Amazon\u2019s second-largest market, and the labor turmoil there shows no sign of resolution. On the surface, the dispute is about money. The German labor union ver.di wants Amazon workers classified as retailing employees, but Amazon says they are logistics workers who should be paid less. Amazon workers in Germany also staged a strike Monday. The company, which employs 9,000 warehouse staff in Germany plus 14,000 seasonal workers at nine distribution centers, said only 640 workers had failed to turn up for the early shift, The Associated Press reported. Ver.di said up to 700 workers joined the strike in Amazon\u2019s logistic center in Bad Hersfeld, as did more than 200 in Leipzig, according to The A.P. Workers at Amazon\u2019s center in Werne were set to strike on Tuesday, ver.di said. Underlying the discontent is a bigger question of whether the warehouse workers should have any control over their workplace. The employees, also known as pickers, assemble the orders. Amazon warehouses are marvels of engineering and efficiency, but picking is still hard physical labor. There is constant monitoring and little job security. Amazon, in its race to stay the dominant e-commerce company, wants maximum flexibility to use its workers as it will. Negotiating would impede efficiency and innovation, Dave Clark, the company\u2019s vice president for worldwide operations and customer service, told The Times last summer. Pickers see it differently. \u2018\u2018The workers are treated more as robots than human,\u2019\u2019 Markus Hoffmann-Achenbach, an organizer for ver.di at the Amazon warehouse in the city of Werne, said by email. He was on his way to Seattle to participate in the demonstration. \u2018\u2018As a worldwide company,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Hoffmann-Achenbach added, \u2018\u2018Amazon should treat their workers fairly and with respect in every country. The solidarity of American unions and ver.di, the united services union of Germany, is a sign that social movements are not bounded by national borders and that in times of globalization the workers worldwide stand together as one.\u2019\u2019 Also traveling to Seattle was Nancy Becker, an American who has been an employee of Amazon in Germany since 2001. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m coming to Seattle to dare Jeff Bezos to try working as a picker for a single week,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m sure he would not survive.\u2019\u2019 An Amazon spokesman declined to comment, but Ralf Kleber, the top Amazon executive in Germany, dismissed the strikers in a recent interview with Reuters, saying the walkout did not slow down deliveries. He also said the workers were largely unskilled and had been unemployed for a long time, with the implication that they should be grateful to be working for Amazon.",

        "name": "Amazon's Prophet And Losses ",
        "content": " Three months ago, you could buy a share of Amazon for $300. Today, it would cost you nearly $400. Surely such a run-up was driven by expectations that the company's all-important fourth quarter would be even better than forecast. Except analysts have been cutting their profit estimates, not raising them. Three months ago, according to Yahoo Finance, analysts calculated that the retailer would earn 77 cents this quarter. Now they foresee only 66 cents. This is the kind of thing that drives Amazon detractors crazy. Lowered expectations mean Amazon has a greater chance of meeting or exceeding them, which would in turn be interpreted as bullish by investors, driving the stock up again. Paulo Santos, a Portuguese trader who writes for Seeking Alpha, has been one of the most consistent and impassioned Amazon critics during the last few years. He has argued that the company is losing money not because it is investing for the future, which is what Amazon says, but because it is a less-than-great business. He has put his money where his arguments are, betting the stock will go down. In retrospect, that was not a good idea. ''I lost and lost big,'' Mr. Santos told me in an email. ''Amazon is more unprofitable now than when I started writing about it, will remain more unprofitable than when I started writing about it, but the stock went up a lot in spite of that.'' Mr. Santos declined to be more specific about his losses, but he said the final straw came when the company released its third-quarter results seven weeks ago. Amazon's revenue was about $400 million more than anticipated, and the stock rose nearly 10 percent. The unexpected increase in revenue, Mr. Santos argued, could be attributed to a change in accounting in which e-books are accounted for at 100 percent of revenue instead of 30 percent of revenue. Others wondered this as well. During the Oct. 24 earnings call, Tom Szkutak, Amazon's chief financial officer, was asked whether an accounting change was driving revenue growth. ''It's not a significant or meaningful impact to the overall growth rates, and certainly this transition has been going on for, you know, some number of quarters now, so it's not a lot I can help you with there,'' Mr. Szkutak said, according to the transcript. This is a typical Amazon response. The company was eager to talk about delivering packages by drones, something that will not happen for years if it ever does. But in general, it says as little as it can about how it makes -- or does not make -- money. Most investors and analysts believe there are good things happening that they cannot quite see. Only a very few, including Mr. Santos, argue that it is the opposite. Yet even the analysts, who are paid big money to understand the company, often appear to be guessing. A columnist for Barron's recently asked a half-dozen Amazon analysts for their Kindle Fire sales estimates. Their answers for 2012 ranged from seven million units to 12.6 million. For 2013, the range was even wider: 10 million to 22.6 million. Amazon says it sells the tablets at cost; it will make its money when people stock up the devices with entertainment. But it does not break out sales of digital media, either. ''They are remarkably adept at putting out a good press release that shows their forward momentum without actually showing their cards,'' Tom Mainelli, who covers tablets for IDC, told the newspaper. Mr. Santos is still convinced he is right about Amazon, but he has thrown in the towel. ''I concede defeat,'' he told his readers. He described himself to me as ''frustrated and furious.'' An Amazon spokesman declined to comment about Mr. Santos, who might be defeated but cannot stay away from the subject. A recent post laid out the reasons Amazon is losing ground to both Google and Walmart.",

        "name": "Fast Rise of Best Buy in the Face of Amazon ",
        "content": " It was a lonely holiday season last year for David Strasser, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. Of the 25 analysts covering the electronics retailer  Best Buy   , he was the only one to make a buy recommendation. And the stock kept going down. \u201cEveryone thought Amazon was going to put them out of business,\u201d Mr. Strasser told me this week. \u201cI\u2019d go into a meeting with clients and the minute I said the words \u2018Best Buy,\u2019 they\u2019d look at their watch and say, \u2018Gotta go.\u2019 \u201d No wonder: Many retail chains were reeling from Internet competition. Best Buy\u2019s former rival Circuit City had already gone bankrupt. Best Buy\u2019s stock had dropped to $11.29 last Dec. 28, from over $50 in 2010. Mr. Strasser clung stubbornly to his conviction that Best Buy would be an exception. Analysts at Janney aren\u2019t allowed to invest in the companies they cover, but \u201cif I could have dropped the coverage and bought the stock, I would have,\u201d Mr. Strasser said. But not even Mr. Strasser believed Best Buy could pull off one of the biggest turnarounds in retail history, which may be what it\u2019s doing if the stock price is any measure. Best Buy stock has gained nearly 240 percent so far this year, putting it among the top three performing stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Now every struggling chain, from J. C. Penney to Barnes & Noble, is scrutinizing Best Buy to figure out how the company did it. Hardly anyone on Wall Street knew Hubert Joly when he was installed as Best Buy\u2019s chief executive   in August 2012. A French-born graduate of the prestigious \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales and the Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques, both in Paris, Mr. Joly was chief executive of Carlson, which owns the travel service Carlson Wagonlit, the Radisson Hotel chain and T.G.I. Fridays restaurants. Because Carlson, based in Minneapolis, is privately held, Mr. Joly wasn\u2019t known in the investment community. And given the length of the search that resulted in his selection at Best Buy \u2014 nine months \u2014 many investors assumed that numerous others had rejected the job. \u201cEveryone assumed they had to scrape the bottom of the barrel,\u201d Mr. Strasser said. \u201cBut my brother\u2019s in the hotel business and he knew this guy. He said, \u2018He\u2019s the smartest guy in the room, even if he does speak with a French accent.\u2019 \u201d Best Buy at the time was in turmoil, its staff demoralized from declining same-store sales, its stock price falling, the previous chief executive ousted in a sex scandal and a leveraged buyout attempt underway by Best Buy\u2019s founder, Richard M. Schulze. That effort later collapsed. In his first major presentation to analysts, Mr. Joly coolly analyzed Best Buy\u2019s strengths and weaknesses \u2014 which  included the perception   that Best Buy was not the low-price leader. In one survey, only 23 percent of respondents thought Best Buy\u2019s prices were \u201clower than others,\u201d far behind Walmart (71 percent), Amazon (56 percent) and Target (38 percent). The result was that many shoppers were browsing in a Best Buy store, using their phones to compare prices and then ordering online from a Best Buy competitor. Like many ideas that seem brilliant in hindsight, \u201cthe strategy is very simple,\u201d Mr. Joly said in 2012, soon after he took the job. \u201cWe believe that price-competitiveness is table stakes. The way we want to win is around the advice, convenience, service.\u201d By matching the lowest price and enhancing service, he was determined to make sure that a customer who came to Best Buy as a showroom had no reason to buy anywhere else. Mr. Strasser attended a conference where Mr. Joly spoke. \u201cIt jumped out at me,\u201d Mr. Strasser said, \u201cthat the most important thing they said was, \u2018If we get someone in the store and they don\u2019t buy, then shame on us. If we get them in the store, they\u2019re going to buy.\u2019 \u201d A few other analysts also took note. \u201cEmbracing the showroom \u2014 that was brilliant,\u201d said Anthony Chukumba, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, and the first analyst to upgrade Best Buy to buy, which he did in January of this year. \u201cCustomer traffic was never the problem. It was conversion. Best Buy said it would match any price. The knee-jerk reaction was that that would kill the margins. But Best Buy took out a lot of costs, and it can make back the margins on volume.\u201d But the strategy wasn\u2019t premised just on price-competitiveness. \u201cOur goal is not to be lower than the competition,\u201d Mr. Joly said. It\u2019s to offer \u201ca very compelling set of customer promises with the assortment, the advice, the convenience, the service. So our goal is simply to eliminate price as an obstacle to buying.\u201d As it happens, I\u2019ve been in the market for a new television since the debut of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the original Netflix series that I couldn\u2019t get on my still-functioning television with its giant tube in the back. Call me hopelessly dated, but sometimes it pays to wait. After doing some research online, I settled on what the reviews called a \u201clow-end\u201d Panasonic Viera model (the 50-inch X60 series plasma), which seemed perfect for my modest needs. These TVs once sold for thousands of dollars, but (even before I had the idea for this column) I found it on the Best Buy website for $399.99, with free delivery. This week, it had jumped to $499.99. Amazon had it for $610. Walmart didn\u2019t have it. Sears offered it for $499.99, but wouldn\u2019t deliver to my Manhattan neighborhood. On Google shopping, the lowest price was $399 with free shipping at ElectronicMegaSale.com. (A Best Buy spokeswoman said the store would match any price if a customer showed it to an employee and the price was from a lengthy list of designated sellers. But ElectronicMegaSale.com doesn\u2019t qualify. She said Best Buy would also match its own lower price within 15 days of purchase or, in the case of the holiday season, through Dec. 24.) I scheduled delivery online, and the night before, Best Buy called with a two-hour window. (Don\u2019t waste your time calling them, because when I tried, the waiting time to speak to someone was \u201cover 20 minutes.\u201d) The TV arrived just a half-hour into the designated period, which is virtually unheard-of in my experience in New York City. And the deliveryman took away the huge old TV, all at no charge. When it came time to set it up, I realized I needed a Blu-ray Disc player for DVDs and streaming from the Internet. So I walked a few blocks to the Best Buy store, which was recently renovated to feature Best Buy\u2019s new \u201cstore within a store\u201d concept featuring showrooms by brand, including Apple and Samsung. (In this, it\u2019s mimicking broader-line department stores.) I was in the store only a few moments when a salesman materialized offering help. He quickly steered me to a Sony Blu-ray player that was $69.99. At that price, I didn\u2019t bother to comparison-shop, but when I later checked online, Amazon had it for $78, as did Walmart. The lowest price on Google shopping was also $78. The salesman seemed to know what he was talking about and made no effort to move me to a more expensive model \u2014 he said I didn\u2019t need one \u2014 or talk me into any kind of service contract. I was out of the store in about five minutes. As far as I was concerned, Best Buy seems to be delivering on its promises. And that seems to be showing up in the operating results. Best Buy announced a few weeks ago that the decline in same-store sales had been reversed in the most recent quarter, and had advanced 1.7 percent. Online sales jumped 15 percent. And earnings beat expectations. \u201cOur focus on delivering our unique customer promises is starting to pay off,\u201d  Mr. Joly said last month   , as are \u201cour efforts to control cost and to bring greater efficiency to our operations by improving our profitability.\u201d He added, \u201cWhile we remain mindful of the fact that we still have a long way to go, we are pleased with the progress.\u201d The lessons for other retailers may be fairly obvious: \u201cEmbrace your customer, don\u2019t alienate them,\u201d said Mr. Chukumba. \u201cThey want the lowest price? They\u2019ll get it. Better service? Give it to them.\u201d By contrast, he said, J. C. Penney seemed to go out of its way to reject its customers. \u201cThe sales you always counted on? They\u2019re over. The brands you love? Gone,\u201d he said. No one expects Best Buy stock to gain another 250 percent next year, but both Mr. Strasser and Mr. Chukumba are still recommending it. Fourteen analysts now rate it a buy or strong buy, and no one has downgraded the stock this year. But not everyone loves the Best Buy turnaround story: Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities has had a sell recommendation all through this year\u2019s run-up, and is now the only analyst who rates Best Buy a sell. \u201cThe negative case is simple,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s Amazon. The misperception about Best Buy is that, because they\u2019re successful at intercepting the customer in the store and getting them to buy a television \u2014 and they\u2019re doing a great job at that \u2014 they can do that with everything. That\u2019s not even close to being true.\u201d He pointed to Sony lithium-ion batteries. He said they were $4.99 each at Best Buy, and $8.99 at Amazon \u2014 for 20. \u201cThat\u2019s 45 cents each!\u201d he said. \u201cYes, Best Buy will match it, but who\u2019s ever going to buy batteries there once you see that?\u201d Amazon doesn\u2019t care if people buy televisions at Best Buy, he said, dismissing my shopping experience. \u201cThat\u2019s a low-margin product,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Best Buy\u2019s margins are eroding.\u201d The verdict is still out on this year\u2019s holiday season, which will be an important test for Mr. Joly and his strategy. Mr. Strasser isn\u2019t breaking out the champagne just yet. \u201cIt was phenomenal, and it\u2019s been a fun ride,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the reality of this business is, you\u2019re always right or wrong. You get humbled every day because something goes wrong. You\u2019re only as good as your last call.\u201d Hubert Joly, the chief executive of Best Buy, at the opening of a \"store within a store\" featuring Samsung at a Best Buy in New York. | Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Samsung",

Penney to Barnes & Noble, is scrutinizing Best Buy to figure out how the company did it. Hardly anyone on Wall Street knew Hubert Joly when he was installed as Best Buy's chief executive in August 2012. A French-born graduate of the prestigious \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales and the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris, Mr. Joly was chief executive of Carlson, which owns the travel service Carlson Wagonlit, the Radisson Hotel chain and T.G.I. Fridays restaurants. Because Carlson, based in Minneapolis, is privately held, Mr. Joly wasn't known in the investment community. And given the length of the search that resulted in his selection at Best Buy -- nine months -- many investors assumed that numerous others had rejected the job. ''Everyone assumed they had to scrape the bottom of the barrel,'' Mr. Strasser said. ''But my brother's in the hotel business and he knew this guy. He said, 'He's the smartest guy in the room, even if he does speak with a French accent.' '' Best Buy at the time was in turmoil, its staff demoralized from declining same-store sales, its stock price falling, the previous chief executive ousted in a sex scandal and a leveraged buyout attempt underway by the founder, Richard M. Schulze. That effort later collapsed. In his first major presentation to analysts, Mr. Joly coolly analyzed Best Buy's strengths and weaknesses -- which included the perception that Best Buy was not the low-price leader. In one survey, only 23 percent of respondents thought Best Buy's prices were ''lower than others,'' far behind Walmart (71 percent), Amazon (56 percent) and Target (38 percent). The result was that many shoppers were browsing in a Best Buy store, using their phones to compare prices and then ordering online from a competitor. Like many ideas that seem brilliant in hindsight, ''the strategy is very simple,'' Mr. Joly said in 2012, soon after he took the job. ''We believe that price-competitiveness is table stakes. The way we want to win is around the advice, convenience, service.'' By matching the lowest price and enhancing service, he was determined to make sure that a customer who came to Best Buy as a showroom had no reason to buy anywhere else. Mr. Strasser attended a conference where Mr. Joly spoke. ''It jumped out at me,'' Mr. Strasser said, ''that the most important thing they said was, 'If we get someone in the store and they don't buy, then shame on us. If we get them in the store, they're going to buy.' '' A few other analysts also took note. ''Embracing the showroom -- that was brilliant,'' said Anthony Chukumba, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, and the first analyst to upgrade Best Buy to buy, which he did in January of this year. ''Customer traffic was never the problem. It was conversion. Best Buy said it would match any price. The knee-jerk reaction was that that would kill the margins. But Best Buy took out a lot of costs, and it can make back the margins on volume.'' But the strategy wasn't premised just on price-competitiveness. ''Our goal is not to be lower than the competition,'' Mr. Joly said. It's to offer ''a very compelling set of customer promises with the assortment, the advice, the convenience, the service. So our goal is simply to eliminate price as an obstacle to buying.'' As it happens, I've been in the market for a new television since the debut of ''House of Cards,'' the original Netflix series that I couldn't get on my still-functioning television with its giant tube in the back. After doing some research online, I settled on what the reviews called a ''low-end'' Panasonic Viera model (the 50-inch X60 series plasma), which seemed perfect for my modest needs. These TVs once sold for thousands of dollars, but (even before I had the idea for this column) I found it on the Best Buy website for $399.99, with free delivery. This week, it had jumped to $499.99. Amazon had it for $610. Walmart didn't have it. Sears offered it for $499.99, but wouldn't deliver to my Manhattan neighborhood. On Google shopping, the lowest price was $399 with free shipping at ElectronicMegaSale.com. (A Best Buy spokeswoman said the store would match any price if a customer showed it to an employee and the price was from a list of designated sellers. But ElectronicMegaSale.com doesn't qualify. She said Best Buy would also match its own lower price within 15 days of purchase or, in the case of the holiday season, through Dec. 24.) I scheduled delivery online, and the night before, Best Buy called with a two-hour window. The TV arrived just a half-hour into the designated period, which is virtually unheard-of in my experience in New York City. And the deliveryman took away the huge old TV, all at no charge. When it came time to set it up, I realized I needed a Blu-ray Disc player for DVDs and streaming from the Internet. So I walked a few blocks to the Best Buy store, which was recently renovated to feature Best Buy's new ''store within a store'' concept featuring showrooms by brand, including Apple and Samsung. (In this, it's mimicking department stores.) I was in the store only a few moments when a salesman materialized offering help. He quickly steered me to a Sony Blu-ray player that was $69.99. At that price, I didn't bother to comparison shop, but when I later checked online, Amazon had it for $78, as did Walmart. The salesman seemed to know what he was talking about and made no effort to move me to a more expensive model or talk me into any kind of service contract. I was out of the store in about five minutes. As far as I am concerned, Best Buy seems to be delivering on its promises. And that seems to be showing up in the operating results. Best Buy announced a few weeks ago that the decline in same-store sales had been reversed in the most recent quarter, and had advanced 1.7 percent. Online sales jumped 15 percent. And earnings beat expectations. ''Our focus on delivering our unique customer promises is starting to pay off,'' Mr. Joly said last month, as are ''our efforts to control cost and to bring greater efficiency to our operations by improving our profitability.'' The lessons for other retailers may be fairly obvious: ''Embrace your customer, don't alienate them,'' said Mr. Chukumba. ''They want the lowest price? They'll get it. Better service? Give it to them.'' By contrast, he said, J. C. Penney seemed to go out of its way to reject its customers. ''The sales you always counted on? They're over. The brands you love? Gone,'' he said. No one expects Best Buy stock to gain another 250 percent next year, but both Mr. Strasser and Mr. Chukumba are still recommending it. Fourteen analysts now rate it a buy or strong buy, and no one has downgraded the stock this year. But not everyone loves the Best Buy story: Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities has had a sell recommendation all through this year's run-up, and is now the only analyst who rates Best Buy a sell. ''The negative case is simple,'' he told me. ''It's Amazon. The misperception about Best Buy is that, because they're successful at intercepting the customer in the store and getting them to buy a television -- and they're doing a great job at that -- they can do that with everything. That's not even close to being true.'' He pointed to Sony lithium-ion batteries. He said they were $4.99 each at Best Buy, and $8.99 at Amazon -- for 20. ''That's 45 cents each!'' he said. ''Yes, Best Buy will match it, but who's ever going to buy batteries there once you see that?'' Amazon doesn't care if people buy televisions at Best Buy, he said, dismissing my shopping experience. ''That's a low-margin product,'' he said. ''And Best Buy's margins are eroding.'' The verdict is still out on this year's holiday season, which will be an important test for Mr. Joly and his strategy. Mr. Strasser isn't breaking out the champagne just yet. ''It was phenomenal, and it's been a fun ride,'' he said. ''But the reality of this business is, you're always right or wrong. You get humbled every day because something goes wrong. You're only as good as your last call.'' A Best Buy in Cambridge, Mass. The store's emphasis on lower prices and smarter customer service has helped it bounce back.

        "name": "Study Suggests Online Sales Tax Bill Could Leave Billions Untaxed ",
        "content": " Proponents of a federal law to force online retailers to collect sales tax should probably ratchet down their hopes and expectations. That, at least, is one conclusion to take from a new  study   sponsored by the Small Business Administration\u2019s  Office of Advocacy . The study found that if the proposed federal law excludes small sellers from having to collect sales taxes online, as many favor, it will probably leave at least 40 percent of all online sales untaxed. As a result, the law would not do as much as some may hope to support traditional Main Street businesses or to increase revenues for strapped municipal governments. Retailers, along with state and local government officials, have joined forces to back the  Marketplace Fairness Act   of 2013 , which passed the Senate earlier this year. The retailers say they are eager to level the playing field with merchants who sell exclusively online and collect sales taxes only in states where they have a physical presence. The retail coalition supporting the legislation includes local businesses and national chains, mostly those whose vast networks of outlets force them to collect sales tax for most online transactions. The local governments hope to reverse a sharp decline in sales tax collection that has followed the move of commerce to the web. The proposed law carves out an exemption for small sellers \u2014 those with revenues of less than $1 million. The study, conducted by a University of Tennessee professor,  Donald Bruce , found that a handful of very large online sellers make the lion\u2019s share of all sales. In fact, the 100 biggest retailers account for about half of all online sales in the United States, and the 10 largest account for a quarter of those sales. All together, e-stores with at least $1 million in sales account for more than 57 percent of total sales. The upshot, the study suggests, is that if an online sales tax law includes an exemption for small sellers, it does not really matter where the threshold is set. Put it at $10 million, as eBay has advocated , and the law will begin to tax somewhere between 56 and 57 percent of online sales. Set it at $500,000, as an earlier version of the Marketplace Fairness Act did, and it appears that the share of online sales subject to the tax rises to 58 percent, at most. (The study does not explicitly say this, but the amount can be derived by using Mr. Bruce\u2019s figures.) For states hoping to use the law to fill growing revenue holes, this bad news is made worse by the fact that many of the larger e-tailers are already collecting sales tax in many jurisdictions. In a separate 2009 study, Mr. Bruce estimated that states lost $11.4 billion to untaxed online sales. Now, however, he finds that of the portion that states could recoup \u2014 that 57 percent, give or take, not claimed by small retailers \u2014 big companies are already collecting sales tax on nearly half of the sales. Nor should brick-and-mortar retailers be too sanguine about the small-seller exception. In practice, the distinction between competing with small online retailers and with Amazon, the world\u2019s largest retail website, appears to be evaporating. That\u2019s because third-party sales through Amazon\u2019s Marketplace for independent sellers are a growing share of total retail sales through Amazon.com, and they will probably exceed Amazon\u2019s own retail sales this year, said Gene Munster, an analyst who follows Amazon for Piper Jaffray & Co. Not only do those small sellers have access to Amazon\u2019s extraordinary online presence and reach \u2014  162 million   visitors each month   to its American site \u2014 but increasingly, they are also relying on Amazon to warehouse and ship their inventory, said Mark Miller, an analyst for the investment firm William Blair & Company. All told, Amazon.com will probably account for a third of all domestic online sales in 2013, Mr. Miller said. Somewhat surprisingly, given their claims to unwavering support for small businesses, House Republican leaders  appear   to be leaning toward legislation that would offer no small-seller exemption at all. But House Republicans are divided about collecting online sales tax \u2014 Democrats largely support it \u2014 and the bill faces an uphill road in the chamber, with or without a small-business exemption.

        "name": "At Your Door in Minutes, Delivered by Robot ",
        "content": " By now the next bright idea from Jeff Bezos -- that tiny drones will one day be whizzing overhead and dropping Amazon packages at America's doorsteps -- has gone through a few turns of the spin cycle. For many, it sounds like a sci-fi fantasy wrapped in public relations hype, or a total nightmare. Maybe both. To which I say: pizza. (Stay with me.) Most of us take it for granted that we can have a pizza delivered to our door in about 30 minutes. But that kind of routine, hyper-convenience usually ends at the edge of the pizza box. Books, clothes, groceries: It usually takes at least 24 hours, and often two to five business days, for goods like those to be delivered. Like it or not, e-commerce is changing the way the world shops. It is also changing expectations. Two-day delivery was great then, but this is now. Mr. Bezos is not the only one who says technology will continue to reshape the old-school delivery business just as it has reshaped so much else. Why? In no small part because there is money to be made. Worldwide, e-commerce sales topped $1 trillion last year, according to the research firm eMarketer. Sales growth in the double digits will almost certainly continue through at least 2016. There is going to be a lot more stuff to deliver out there. What we buy on our smartphones in seconds we want on our doorstep in minutes. Even the serious technophiles like Mr. Bezos say delivery drones and their ilk are still years away. Many ordinary people probably think the idea sounds dangerous, maybe even a little creepy, given that these drones will have cameras. So far, the Federal Aviation Administration has resisted the idea. Swarms of computer-guided octocopters? As if the F.A.A. doesn't have enough to do. But given the explosive growth of e-commerce, some experts say the shipping business is in for big changes. United Parcel Service, which traces its history to 1907, delivers more than four billion packages and documents a year. It operates a fleet of more than 95,000 vehicles and 500 aircraft. The ubiquitous Brown is a $55 billion-plus-a-year business. And, like Amazon, U.P.S. is reportedly looking into drones. So is Google. More and more e-commerce companies are making a point of delivering things quickly the old-fashioned way -- with humans. Some of the dreamers in the technology industry are dreaming even bigger. It won't be just drones, they insist. Robots and autonomous vehicles -- think Google's driverless car -- could also disrupt the delivery business. ''As cities become more automated, you're going to start to see on-demand delivery systems that look like small delivery vehicles and can bring you whatever you want to wherever you are,'' said Bryant Walker Smith, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School and a member of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford. ''Rather than go to the store to buy some milk, a robot or drone will go to a warehouse and get it for you, then deliver it.'' Mr. Smith said these delivery vehicles would come in all shapes and sizes. Some might be able to scurry down alleyways and avoid traffic. Others could be refrigerated to store food. Brad Templeton, a futurist and a member of the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the current systems for delivery -- ''with the exception of pizza'' -- were too cumbersome and expensive for today's online shoppers. Autonomous vehicles, including drones, promise a faster, cheaper option. ''The cost of use will be pennies on the dollar compared to today's delivery systems,'' Mr. Templeton said. This, he added, could very quickly eat into the business of many delivery companies. ''None of the horse and carriage companies of the past ended up becoming automobile companies today,'' said Mr. Templeton, who is also a consultant on the Google team designing a driverless car. The roadblocks, real and potential, are significant. Safety is one worry. Another is current technology. Drones like the ones showcased by Amazon are electric and are estimated to be able to carry only small packages weighing less than five pounds. That means they would not work for most online purchases. Hal Bennett, a drone researcher, has a possible answer for that. He wants to build drones powered by tiny jet engines rather than electric ones. He says they could carry 50- and 100-pound packages 45,000 feet up at 250 miles an hour. While his drones are still in a research phase, and very much under wraps, Mr. Bennett said the possibilities were endless. ''Imagine you're climbing around in Yosemite and you decided you want a Burger King hamburger. You just order it on your GPS,'' Mr. Bennett said. Many people probably don't want to imagine that. Drones over El Capitan? Delivering, of all things, fast food? Then again, American pizzerias really began routine deliveries only in the 1950s, reflecting the rise of another bit of technology: the automobile. Then, in the '60s, a man who started out with one pizzeria in Ypsilanti, Mich., came along and made quick delivery a priority. His name was Thomas Monaghan. The company: Domino's.

        "content": " In an out-of-the-way Google office, two life-size humanoid robots hang suspended in a corner. If Amazon.com can imagine delivering books by drones, is it too much to think that Google might be planning to one day have one of the robots hop off an automated Google Car and race to your doorstep to deliver a package? Google executives acknowledge that robotic vision is a \u2018\u2018moonshot.\u2019\u2019 But it appears to be more realistic than Amazon\u2019s proposed drone delivery service, which Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, revealed in a television interview the evening before one of the biggest online shopping days of the year. Over the past half-year, Google has quietly acquired seven technology companies in an effort to create a new generation of robots. And the engineer heading the effort is Andy Rubin, the man who built Google\u2019s Android software into the world\u2019s dominant force in smartphones. The company is tight-lipped about its specific plans, but the scale of the investment, which has not been previously disclosed, indicates that this is no cute science project. At least for now, Google\u2019s robotics effort is not something aimed at consumers. Instead, the company\u2019s expected targets are in manufacturing \u2014 like electronics assembly, which is now largely manual \u2014 and competing with companies like Amazon in retailing, according to several people with specific knowledge of the project. A realistic case, according to several specialists, would be automating portions of an existing supply chain that stretches from a factory floor to the companies that ship and deliver goods to a consumer\u2019s doorstep. \u2018\u2018The opportunity is massive,\u2019\u2019 said Andrew McAfee, a principal research scientist at the M.I.T. Center for Digital Business. \u2018\u2018There are still people who walk around in factories and pick things up in distribution centers and work in the back rooms of grocery stores.\u2019\u2019 Google has recently started experimenting with package delivery in urban areas with its Google Shopping service, and it could try to automate portions of that system. The shopping service, available in a few locations like San Francisco, is already making home deliveries for companies like Target, Walgreens and American Eagle Outfitters. Perhaps someday, there will be automated delivery to the doorstep, which for now is dependent on humans. \u2018\u2018Like any moonshot, you have to think of time as a factor,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Rubin said. \u2018\u2018We need enough runway and a 10-year vision.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Rubin, the 50-year-old Google executive in charge of the new effort, began his engineering career in robotics and has long had a well-known passion for building intelligent machines. Before joining Apple Computer, where he initially worked as a manufacturing engineer in the 1990s, he worked for the German manufacturing company Carl Zeiss as a robotics engineer. \u2018\u2018I have a history of making my hobbies into a career,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Rubin said in a telephone interview. \u2018\u2018This is the world\u2019s greatest job. Being an engineer and a tinkerer, you start thinking about what you would want to build for yourself.\u2019\u2019 He used the example of a windshield wiper that has enough \u2018\u2018intelligence\u2019\u2019 to operate when it rains, without human intervention, as a model for the kind of systems he is trying to create. That is consistent with a vision put forward by the Google co-founder Larry Page, who has argued that technology should be deployed wherever possible to free humans from drudgery and repetitive tasks. The veteran of a number of previous Silicon Valley start-up efforts and twice a chief executive, Mr. Rubin said he had pondered the possibility of a commercial effort in robotics for more than a decade. He has only recently come to think that a range of technologies have matured to the point where new kinds of automated systems can be commercialized. Earlier this year, Mr. Rubin stepped down as head of the company\u2019s Android smartphone division. Since then he has convinced Google\u2019s founders, Sergey Brin and Mr. Page, that the time is right for such a venture, and they have opened Google\u2019s checkbook to back him. He declined to say how much the company would spend. Mr. Rubin compared the effort to the company\u2019s self-driving car project, which was started in 2009. \u2018\u2018The automated car project was science fiction when it started,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Now it is coming within reach.\u2019\u2019 He acknowledged that breakthroughs would still be necessary in areas like software and sensors, but said that hardware issues like mobility and moving hands and arms had been resolved. Mr. Rubin has secretly acquired an array of robotics and artificial intelligence start-up companies in the United States and Japan. Among the companies are Schaft, a small team of Japanese roboticists who recently left Tokyo University to develop a humanoid robot, and Industrial Perception, a start-up in Palo Alto that has developed computer vision systems and robot arms for loading and unloading trucks. Also acquired were Meka and Redwood Robotics, makers of humanoid robots and robot arms in San Francisco, and Bot & Dolly, a maker of robotic camera systems that were recently used to create special effects in the movie \u2018\u2018Gravity.\u2019\u2019 A related firm, Autofuss, which focuses on advertising and design, and Holomni, a small design firm that makes high-tech wheels, were acquired as well. The seven companies are capable of creating technologies needed to build a mobile, dexterous robot. Mr. Rubin said he was pursuing additional acquisitions. Unlike Google\u2019s futuristic X lab, which does research on things like the driverless cars and the wearable Google Glass device, the robotics effort \u2014 moonshots aside \u2014 is meant to sell products sooner rather than later. It has not yet been decided whether the effort will be a new product group inside Google or a separate subsidiary, Mr. Rubin said. The Google robotics group will initially be based in Palo Alto, with an office in Japan. In addition to his acquisitions, Mr. Rubin has begun hiring roboticists and is bringing in other Google programmers to assist in the project. While Google has not detailed its long-term robotics plans, Mr. Rubin said there were both manufacturing and logistics markets that are not being served by today\u2019s robotic technologies, and that they are clear opportunities. This is not the first time that Google has strayed beyond the typical confines of a technology company. It has already shaken up the world\u2019s automobile companies with its robot car project. Google has not yet publicly stated whether it intends to sell its own vehicles or become a supplier.",

        "name": "IBM\u2019s Big Plans for Cloud Computing ",
        "content": " Ambition is an impressive thing, particularly when a desire for world domination is combined with existential survival. Four heavyweight tech companies are translating that ambition into investments in their cloud computing services: IBM, Microsoft, Amazon and Google are all  expected to spend more than $1 billion annually on their   global networks in the coming years . Even more important, however, is that all the companies are developing knowledge through their cloud services of how to run truly huge Internet-based computing systems \u2014 systems that may soon be nearly impossible for other companies to match. If any other company is thinking of entering the business, like China\u2019s Tencent, for example, they\u2019ll need to move fast or come up with something revolutionary. IBM\u2019s response? You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. In 2014, the company will make a series of announcements that will shiver all challengers, according to Lance Crosby, chief executive of SoftLayer, a cloud computing company that  IBM purchased earlier this year for $2   billion . More than 100 products, like e-commerce and marketing tools, will be put inside the cloud as a comprehensive series of offerings for business, Mr. Crosby said. So will another 40 infrastructure services, like big data analysis and mobile applications development. \u201cIt will take Amazon 10 years to build all of this,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will be creating businesses with this that we can only dream about.\u201d Maybe. IBM already claims to lead in cloud computing revenue, with $1 billion in revenue in the past quarter alone. That\u2019s impressive, though that revenue includes revenue from software that used to be attributed to a different category at the company. And some of the revenue is being generated by companies IBM recently acquired, including SoftLayer. On many other fronts, such as the number of machines it operates, the number of major companies running big parts of their business on IBM\u2019s public cloud, and the new technology it appears to have built for cloud computing, IBM is arguably the laggard among the top four providers. As the SoftLayer purchase indicates, it has had to buy big for what the others have mostly grown internally. What IBM does have, however, is a lot of money and resources it plans to throw at cloud computing. And given its experience in the early-1990s, when it faced a near-death experience after missing a major technology shift, the company may also have a belly for a swift change. The big push will begin in February, Mr. Crosby said, with a formal inauguration of its new cloud offerings by Virginia M. Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive. IBM has also deployed  400 employees to OpenStack , an open source software project with more than  200   corporate members   that goes after much of the proprietary cloud systems of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. This seems much like IBM\u2019s involvement a decade ago in Linux, which helped that open source operating system win corporate hearts and minds. In addition to the consolidation of online software and services, Mr. Crosby said, IBM is \u201cabsolutely\u201d looking to sell its big mainframe computing capabilities as a cloud-based service. It also plans to draw on the insights it has gained from building and licensing technology used by Microsoft in the Xbox gaming console, and Google in its own network operations, he said, and will make more acquisitions for the cloud business. \u201cWe make the processors in Google\u2019s server racks,\u201d he said, \u201cWe understand where gaming is going. Before I got here, I thought this was a big old tech company, too; I didn\u2019t see all of the assets.\u201d It\u2019s true that IBM is big. And, it is also a tech company. And undeniably 102 years old, which makes it both a survivor and a creature of successful processes. Mr. Crosby has two bosses between him and Ms. Rometty, and numerous executive vice presidents above him that may agree on the eventual future, but have their own views about the speed with which they\u2019ll move there.

If Amazon.com can imagine delivering books by drones, is it too much to think that Google might be planning to one day have one of the robots hop off an automated Google Car and race to your doorstep to deliver a package? Google executives admit that robotic vision is a \u201cmoonshot.\u201d But it appears to be more realistic than Amazon\u2019s proposed drone delivery service, which Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, revealed in a television interview the evening before one of the biggest online shopping days of the year. Over the last half-year, Google has quietly acquired seven technology companies in an effort to create a new generation of robots. And the engineer heading the effort is Andy Rubin, the man who built Google\u2019s Android software into the world\u2019s dominant force in smartphones.

        "name": "Justices pass on Internet tax case; Online retailers hoped to challenge New York law regulating purchases ",
        "content": " The United States Supreme Court has let stand a ruling from New York\u2019s highest court requiring Internet retailers to collect sales taxes even if they have no physical presence in the state. As is their custom, the justices gave no reasons for their decision on Monday not to hear the case, which involved Amazon.com, the online giant, and a smaller competitor, Overstock.com. The two companies challenged a 2008 state law that required online companies to collect sales taxes on purchases made by New York residents. Brick-and-mortar companies often complain that they are put at a competitive disadvantage when they are required to collect sales taxes and online companies are not. In March, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the companies had a sufficient presence in the state because of affiliated independent sites that linked to the retailers in return for a commission. \u2018\u2018The bottom line,\u2019\u2019 the chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, wrote for the majority, \u2018\u2018is that if a vendor is paying New York residents to actively solicit business in this state, there is no reason why that vendor should not shoulder the appropriate tax burden.\u2019\u2019 The chief judge added that it might be time to reconsider the basic rule that states may not collect taxes from out-of-state companies without some physical presence in the state, a principle recognized by the United States Supreme Court in its 1992 decision in Quill Corporation v. North Dakota. \u2018\u2018The world has changed dramatically in the last two decades,\u2019\u2019 Chief Judge Lippman wrote, \u2018\u2018and it may be that the physical presence test is outdated. An entity may now have a profound impact upon a foreign jurisdiction solely through its virtual projection via the Internet. That question, however, would be for the United States Supreme Court to consider.\u2019\u2019 Monday\u2019s order indicated that such reconsideration must wait. The cases were Overstock.com v. New York Taxation Department, No. 13-252, and Amazon.com v. New York Taxation Department, No. 13-259. In a statement, Amazon urged Congress to act to impose a national solution. \u2018\u2018The Supreme Court already has addressed the sales tax issue, saying in Quill that Congress can and should act to resolve it,\u2019\u2019 the statement said. \u2018\u2018The Marketplace Fairness Act now pending before Congress would protect states\u2019 rights to make their own revenue policy choices while allowing them to collect more than a fraction of the revenue that\u2019s already owed.\u2019\u2019 For now, Amazon has been making some state-by-state accommodations. It has struck deals in several states to build warehouses in exchange for agreeing to collect taxes. According to its website, Amazon collects taxes in 16 states, including California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Texas. In asking the Supreme Court to step in, Theodore B. Olson, a lawyer for Amazon, wrote that \u2018\u2018this case raises issues of exceptional importance.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The decision below,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, \u2018\u2018leaves in place a state law that will significantly and unduly burden interstate commerce, provides a road map for other jurisdictions to inflict similar burdens on interstate commerce and threatens to sow widespread confusion in an area that is \u2014 in the best of times \u2014 already \u2018something of a quagmire,\u2019\u2019\u2019 he wrote, quoting from the Quill decision. In urging the justices not to hear the cases, Barbara D. Underwood, New York\u2019s solicitor general, wrote that the state law called for only simple fairness. \u2018\u2018Although sales taxes are indisputably owed when a New York resident purchases goods from an out-of-state retailer for delivery in-state, the overwhelming majority of those purchases are never reported to the state taxing authorities, and hence taxes on them are never collected,\u2019\u2019 she wrote. The law, she continued, \u2018\u2018seeks to restore a level playing field between in-state brick-and-mortar stores and their out-of-state Internet-only counterparts.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " Hard to believe, but there was once a time when the visionaries worked for the government. Rebuilding a ruined Europe, putting a man on the moon, ending poverty, connecting the American interior with highways \u2014 these were immense tasks undertaken, and often achieved, by bureaucrats. The wild dreamers these days work for technology companies. Elon Musk, not content with making the first commercially viable electric car, has a proposal for a trainlike system that would speed travelers at 600 miles, or 965 kilometers, an hour. Google, hard at work assembling the world\u2019s information, has started a company to cheat death. Mark Zuckerberg has plans to put everyone in the world in touch. And now Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, says he is planning to take what looks like a barbecue grill, attach eight propellers and a basket to it and use it to deliver small items to people\u2019s houses. He sketched a vision where no one would ever have to get off a hammock for a resupply of Pringles or Milk Duds. The announcement by Mr. Bezos on the American television news magazine program \u2018\u201860 Minutes\u2019\u2019 on Sunday was one of those moments when the future suddenly seemed much closer. But the news also served to emphasize a less appreciated hallmark of the technology world: its masterful use of public relations. Certainly Amazon, especially in Europe, would not mind changing the subject right now. Amazon warehouse workers are striking in Germany. The French are proposing to restrain the company with a law that forbids discounting on books. And in Britain, sending an undercover reporter to an Amazon warehouse is becoming routine. The most recent such investigation, which offered an indictment not only of Amazon but also of the workplace culture that makes it such a success, was published last weekend in The Guardian. And so why not distract the world, if at least briefly, as Mr. Bezos seems to have done. Package delivery by drone is a loopy idea, far-fetched and the subject of instant mockery on Twitter \u2014 but it is hard to deny its audacity. \u2018\u2018I am blown away by what I see coming out of the private sector these days,\u2019\u2019 said Andrew McAfee, co-founder of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. \u2018\u2018All the building blocks are in place for breakthroughs: The Internet goes everywhere. Everyone has a device connected to the network. And the cost of technology experimentation is so low. We don\u2019t need one single entity with massive resources to deliver these really cool innovations.\u2019\u2019 The announcement by Mr. Bezos on Sunday evening came at the end of a \u2018\u201860 Minutes\u2019\u2019 feature about Amazon and its preparations for so-called Cyber Monday, the most hyped online shopping day in the United States. \u2018\u2018We can do half-hour delivery,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos said. He also said the drones could carry as much as five pounds and could fly 10 miles from the delivery center. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t want anybody to think this is just around the corner,\u2019\u2019 he said in an uncharacteristic note of caution. Which brought up the immediate question: Why announce it now? Amazon is so tight-lipped it will not often confirm what happened in the past, like how many Kindles it has sold. It almost never talks about the future. On the show, Mr. Bezos dodged a question about whether Amazon would soon release a television set-top box. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about the future road map of our devices,\u2019\u2019 he said. Unless, apparently, he did want to. \u2018\u2018Whether this ever amounts to anything, it was definitely a good P.R. move,\u2019\u2019 said Tory Patrick, leader of the retail technology practice at Walker Sands Communications, a consulting firm. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s Cyber Monday and Amazon is on the brain.\u2019\u2019 Beyond that \u2014 beyond Amazon\u2019s meteoric stock price, its capacity to bring more goodies to more people in less time, its ceaseless innovation, its ability to make other retailers look hapless \u2014 the company is enduring an unusual period of criticism. Its success is breeding anger. In the Guardian article, Carole Cadwalladr wrote that her fellow workers used to be builders, hospitality managers, marketing graduates, carpenters and electricians. \u2018\u2018They owned their own businesses, and they were made redundant,\u2019\u2019 she added. \u2018\u2018Or the business went bust. Or they had a stroke. Or their contract ended. They are people who had skilled jobs, or professional jobs, or just better-paying jobs. And now they work for Amazon, earning the minimum wage, and most of them are grateful to have that.\u2019\u2019 In the United States, any resistance is much more muted. But Amazon fought back hard this fall against a new book, \u2018\u2018The Everything Store\u2019\u2019 by Brad Stone, accusing it of containing an unbalanced depiction of the company as a brutal place to work. \u2018\u2018The timing is interesting,\u2019\u2019 said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester. \u2018\u2018The drones could be a game-changer \u2014 20 years from now.\u2019\u2019 An Amazon webpage put up immediately after the \u2018\u201860 Minutes\u2019\u2019 broadcast was much more bold about the drone delivery service, which is called Prime Air. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ll be ready to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place,\u2019\u2019 Amazon promised. That, it said, meant 2015, when the Federal Aviation Administration will issue new rules for commercial drones. The F.A.A. needed a year merely to prepare its 74-page plan for the integration of drones into the national airspace. Specific details on putting those rules into effect are still to come, the agency said. In fact, civilian use of drone aircraft so far meets fewer regulatory obstacles in Europe than in the United States. While the European Union, like the F.A.A., is trying to map out rules, individual countries \u2014 including Britain, France and Germany \u2014 are taking their own approaches, in many cases even encouraging drone development. So far, nearly 1,000 unmanned vehicles are authorized to fly commercially in and around a dozen European countries. Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said he was dissatisfied with the F.A.A. plan because he felt it had scant privacy protections. \u2018\u2018Clear rules must be set that protect the privacy and safety of the public,\u2019\u2019 he said in a statement on Monday. Jaron Lanier, a technology skeptic who wrote \u2018\u2018You Are Not a Gadget,\u2019\u2019 said the drones would encourage the sort of divisions that undermine society. \u2018\u2018I can easily picture a scenario where drones deliver things to upscale tech-savvy customers,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018But note the implication, whether intended or not, that working-class truck drivers will no longer transgress geographic class lines. It\u2019s also hard to imagine delivery drones flying unmolested in restive working-class or poor areas.

You\u2019ll have less pollution.\u2019\u2019 Ms. Patrick, the consultant, said there was no question of what people would want. \u2018\u2018If Amazon can pull this off, people will say, \u2018This is awesome, I can get toilet paper in 30 minutes.\u2019 And they will.\u2019\u2019",

It might bring a whole new meaning to the phrase ''e-commerce wars.'' The general reaction among Amazon-watchers, however, was that Amazon had scored a significant P.R. coup. ''60 Minutes'' had teased the revelation over the weekend, setting Twitter afire. ''Does @Amazon sell pets? I would savor the irony of ordering a bird that is delivered via flying robot,'' wrote @scottEweinberg. ''Next, Amazon fulfillment centers in your basement,'' speculated @delrey. That did seem about the only innovation left. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",

Driverless cars   are being developed  to help move goods and people   from place to place. \u201cLocation, location, location\u201d is the saying in real estate: a property\u2019s value is determined primarily by its location. An apartment in central Illinois might be worth 20 times as much in Manhattan, because a Manhattan apartment gives its resident access to many more goods, activities and high-paying jobs. This is not to say that urban living is always the best, or that all urban properties are created equal. Locations involve trade-offs, and rural areas offer amenities that big cities cannot. But for centuries, real estate markets have shown that people and businesses are willing to pay more for urban properties. As technology helps with moving goods and people more cheaply, it might seem that urban real estate would give up some of its price premium because distance becomes less of an obstacle to economic transactions. Wouldn\u2019t a driverless car cause some workers to sell their Manhattan apartments and commute to their jobs from more spacious homes in the suburbs or even  rural New York State ? But don\u2019t forget that many people and businesses currently avoid urban areas because of the monthly expense of owning or renting urban property. New technologies might allow them to use urban properties on a part-time basis, or use less urban property to accomplish the same tasks, which would make urban property more valuable. A restaurant may need less refrigeration and storage space because it takes multiple food deliveries per day. Grocery stores may save on shelf space by having a greater fraction of their items delivered directly to customers without being shelved in the store. Households may opt for less storage space or parking, for example \u2014 and more room for people \u2014 when they can get items and transportation cheaply and on time. For every Manhattan resident who leaves his apartment for the suburbs, there could be many others for whom technology induces them to use a Manhattan property on a part-time basis. New technologies are more likely to emerge in urban areas, because that\u2019s where the innovators expect to find the most customers. Amazon said that it planned to start its drone service in urban areas, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the first commercial uses of driverless cars were in big cities like San Francisco or Los Angeles. Thus, while cities already give their residents access to more goods and services, technology may further shift that advantage and thereby increase urban property values.

        "content": " Amazon   is promising yet more jam tomorrow \u2013 this time from  drone   deliveries. Jeff Bezos , the online retailer\u2019s chief executive, expects to be able to use unmanned aircraft to deliver small packages within a few years. It\u2019s a striking vision, but it seems as overly optimistic as investors\u2019 expectations of the company over all. Amazon\u2019s market value has ballooned to $180 billion, despite big profits always hovering in the future. Drone technology has advanced tremendously over the past decade because of improvements in software, robotics and networking. The use of these unmanned vehicles is already common in the military, and cheap, fast and automated shipping could benefit all kinds of businesses. Mr. Bezos says Amazon could use drones within four or five years, delivering goods weighing less than five pounds inside 30 minutes. It\u2019s perhaps fitting that a long-term thinker like Mr. Bezos should be testing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible. But at best, it\u2019s a long way off. The  Federal Aviation Administration   may start allowing commercial drones to operate in 2015, but widespread use is likely to come only many years later. Letting robots fly freely in densely populated areas poses all kinds of safety, security and privacy questions \u2013 never mind logistical challenges and concerns that hackers or old-fashioned villains might intercept the vehicles or the packages they carry. Mr. Bezos has always made clear that he runs Amazon with the goal of rapid growth while maximizing profit over the long run. Getting everyone to talk about his company on Cyber Monday, the most important day of the year for online shopping, will help accomplish the former. Analysts expect Amazon\u2019s revenue to be around $75 billion this year, 23 percent more than last. But it\u2019s still not clear when Amazon will deliver normal, never mind supernormal, profitability. The company expects that it will roughly break even again this holiday quarter. Based on estimates compiled by  Thomson   Reuters , Amazon trades at a valuation of 165 times the coming 12 months of earnings, against 15 times for its peer group. Like a drone delivering trinkets any time soon, that\u2019s a triumph of investor hope over experience. Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

        "content": " Jeff Bezos, as always, is thinking outside the box \u2014 way, way outside. Sunday night  on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Mr. Bezos , the Amazon founder, floated the notion of using drones to deliver packages. He showed Charlie Rose a video of a tiny helicopter seizing a package from a warehouse and airlifting it to a house. The drone then took off again. Amazon has already named its future delivery system Prime Air. \u201cI know this looks like science fiction,\u201d Mr. Bezos said. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Still, even the hyper-optimistic Mr. Bezos cautioned that there were \u201cyears of additional work from this point.\u201d He told the show the hardest challenge would be convincing the Federal Aviation Administration that this is a good idea. Well, the F.A.A. and everyone else. The commercial use of drones was legalized early in 2012, but there has been a good deal of outcry about drones possibly being used for surveillance. Some communities are banning local police from using drones. How receptive they would be to e-commerce applications is unclear. An Amazon promotional page   for Prime Air, however, said the delivery system was practically a done deal. \u201cFrom a technology point of view, we\u2019ll be ready to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place,\u201d the company said. It said that could be two years away. No mention was made of what would happen if you live in an apartment. Or whether you would get your money back if your neighbor shot down your delivery. Or, as Mr. Bezos said: \u201cThe hard part here is putting in all the redundancy, all the reliability, all the systems you need to say, \u2018Look, this thing can\u2019t land on somebody\u2019s head while they\u2019re walking around their neighborhood.\u2019\u201d He later added, \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d If Amazon could do it, so presumably could Walmart and the many other retailers trying to do same-day delivery. It might bring a whole new meaning to the phrase \u201ce-commerce wars.\u201d The general reaction among Amazon-watchers, however, was that Amazon had scored a significant P.R. coup. \u201c60 Minutes\u201d had teased the revelation over the weekend, setting Twitter afire. \u201cDoes @Amazon sell pets? I would savor the irony of ordering a bird that is delivered via flying robot,\u201d wrote  @scottEweinberg . \u201cNext, Amazon fulfillment centers in your basement,\u201d speculated  @delrey .

        "content": " On its home territory, Amazon.com is routinely hailed as a jobs machine. Thanks to its warehouse building spree, it is hiring tens of thousands of workers, plus many more for the holidays. President Obama, speaking at the retailer\u2019s Chattanooga, Tenn., warehouse in July, called Amazon \u201ca great example of what\u2019s possible.\u201d Referring to an Amazon program that offers tuition assistance to hourly workers, Mr. Obama said, \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of approach that we need from America\u2019s businesses.\u201d He also celebrated the company\u2019s achievement in general, saying, \u201cI look at this amazing facility and you guys, you don\u2019t miss a beat.\u201d The recession might have cut deeper in Europe, making the question of new jobs even more crucial, but the attitude there is much cooler toward Amazon and its high-tech ways. In Germany, there is  continuing labor strife . France is  erecting barriers   against the company\u2019s aggressive discounting. And in Britain, the warehouses that so impressed President Obama have been compared,  in a February story in The Financial Times,   with a \u201cslave camp.\u201d That shocking charge  resurfaced   in the latest investigation, when a BBC reporter, Adam Littler, went to work briefly at Amazon\u2019s Swansea warehouse. His report, broadcast this week on the show \u201cPanorama,\u201d showed him hustling to keep up with the demands of his hand-held scanner, which gave him only a few moments to find each product. In his ten-and-a-half-hour night shift,  Mr. Littler said:   \u201cI managed to walk or hobble nearly 11 miles, just short of 11 miles last night. I\u2019m absolutely shattered.\u201d He added, \u201cWe are machines, we are robots, we plug our scanner in, we\u2019re holding it, but we might as well be plugging it into ourselves.\u201d Michael Marmot, a labor expert identified by the BBC as \u201cone of Britain\u2019s leading experts on stress at work,\u201d told the show that with \u201cthe characteristics of this type of job, the evidence shows increased risk of mental illness and physical illness.\u201d Mr. Marmot went on to say that: \u201cThere are always going to be menial jobs, but we can make them better or worse. And it seems to me the demands of efficiency at the cost of individual\u2019s health and well-being \u2014 it\u2019s got to be balanced.\u201d Amazon replied in a statement   that, \u201cWe strongly refute the charge that Amazon exploits its employees in any way. \u201d It also said it had retained \u201can independent expert,\u201d who concluded that the job of picking products \u201cdoes not increase the risk of mental and physical illness.\u201d Underneath the statement was a video clip of a BBC interview with an Amazon employee named Michael Crisp. It was somewhat mysterious because Mr. Crisp is identified as being on break from an Amazon warehouse in South Carolina but he used British locutions like \u201cwhinging\u201d and referred to kilos. Still, his defense of Amazon as a reasonable place to work was clear. \u201cI certainly haven\u2019t come across anybody yet with any mental problems,\u201d he said.

        "content": " A FEW years ago, one of my graduate students showed me a Google Earth image that changed my view of the world. On a photo showing all of South America, I could clearly see a single soybean farm in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. My first thought was that a farm that big, sitting on the edge of the Amazon, must be an environmental disaster. But when it comes to agricultural sustainability, all is not what it seems. Despite what you might hear at your local farmers\u2019 market or Whole Foods, not all big farms are bad. Nor are all small organic farms sustainable. They may produce high-quality food, but if they don\u2019t produce a lot of calories per acre, they are doing little to help increase the global food supply. How we increase this supply over the next few decades will determine agriculture\u2019s sustainability. It\u2019s worth exploring why this is so, because sustainable food production is a fundamental human need. Getting it right will require us to carefully assess the consequences of where and how we farm. Already, the world\u2019s farms take up an area the size of South America. By 2050, a global population of nearly 10 billion people will require roughly 70 percent more food. We have two options: Either we need to get more food out of the land we already farm, or we need to farm more land. Nowhere are farmers pursuing the first option faster than in Mato Grosso. Last January I decided to see the consequences for myself. After a long flight from Boston, I rode the night bus nearly 500 miles of rutted roads to reach the frontier town of Canarana. Only about 25,000 people live here, but the main street has several stores selling million-dollar tractors. Waiting for my ride to the farm, I met a man from Silicon Valley who commutes every month to sell heavy equipment. He told me, \u201cThis is where the money is.\u201d How can we determine if these farms are sustainable? Admittedly, it\u2019s unnerving to stand in an endless sea of soybeans where there was once rain forest. Exotic animals like tapirs, jaguars and rheas wander through the monocrop desert, and macaws compete for airspace with crop dusters. But sustainability has little to do with appearances. Sustainability depends on whether a farm can continue to produce food over the long term, without irreparably damaging the environment or causing other land to be cleared in the quest for increased food production. For the past five years, my students, colleagues and I have been trying to understand the sustainability of these giant soy farms. Although I typically work on tropical forests and the soils that sustain them, the fate of the forests I love is intimately intertwined with the way people use them. When colleagues suggested that I come to Mato Grosso to see this bustling agricultural frontier, I jumped at the chance. We focused first on fertilizer. Fertilizer helps grow more food on a given plot of land, but overuse can have serious environmental consequences. Largely, these depend on how efficiently farms use nitrogen and phosphorus. These two elements, which limit how much crops can grow, are the main components of fertilizer. Crops don\u2019t absorb all the fertilizer farmers apply, and what\u2019s left behind often ends up in waterways, where it fuels algae growth. Fifty years of heavy fertilizer use in the breadbaskets of the United States and Europe has left lakes, rivers and coasts with algae-choked \u201cdead zones.\u201d We expected the story to be similar in Mato Grosso. But to our surprise, we\u2019ve found that streams draining the farms there have no more nitrogen or phosphorus than those in adjacent forests. The deep tropical soils are highly efficient filters, removing nutrients before they reach the water. In the American Midwest, scientists have long been searching for ways to clean up farm runoff. In Mato Grosso, the soils do the work. But these same soils present a sustainability concern on a different front. After millions of years of heavy rainfall, Mato Grosso\u2019s soils have lost nearly all their phosphorus. The soils efficiently remove phosphorus before it reaches the streams but also bind phosphorus added as fertilizer, leaving less for the crops. As a result, farms here require twice as much phosphorus fertilizer as their counterparts in more temperate regions, where the soils are younger and more fertile. And phosphate ore, the source of phosphorus fertilizer, is a finite resource. The world\u2019s phosphorus reserves are held by a handful of countries \u2014 the exact distribution is disputed, but possibly half of it is in Morocco alone. Much of Morocco\u2019s phosphate ore is carried 61 miles across the Western Sahara to the Atlantic, on the  world\u2019s longest conveyor belt   . A farm might not be sustainable if it depended on political stability in faraway countries. And how should we weigh the negative of phosphorus depletion against the positive of reduced water pollution? We don\u2019t yet know the answers. The fertilizer story makes it complicated to figure out the sustainability of Mato Grosso\u2019s farms, which send their soy to China, as animal feed, and to Europe. Even more complicated is the question of how these farms will affect the global climate. The link, while not obvious, is important. Global warming results largely from burning fossil fuels. But another important contributor \u2014 about 15 percent of our carbon-dioxide emissions \u2014 comes from changing land use, primarily the burning of tropical rain forests to make room for food or biofuel crops. If we really want to know the environmental impact of these soy farms, we need to understand their effect on carbon-dioxide emissions. Natural science alone cannot answer this question, so I increasingly find myself talking to economists and sociologists. Because at the end of the day, the carbon footprint of these farms will depend on whether their economic success leads to more deforestation. If so, their carbon footprint will be huge. This would be a deathblow to their sustainability. On the other hand, these soy fields produce more calories than the low-productivity pastures they replaced. Remember options one and two: To feed a growing population we will need to either farm more land, or to get more food out of the land we farm. Either option will need to be coupled with efforts to reduce food waste and to feed fewer crops to animals. For now, deforestation rates in Mato Grosso have slowed, as pastures have been converted to soy. It may be that megafarms, unlike the small-scale landholders they replace, are more reticent to take on the sanctions that come with illegal deforestation, though there are certainly other potential explanations. We don\u2019t know if the slowdown in deforestation will continue. If it does, and if big soy is a reason, one could argue that these fields are a boon to the global environment far greater than your local organic farm. One thing is clear: In the coming decades we will need to produce a lot more food. I\u2019m not suggesting Mato Grosso\u2019s farms are the answer, far from it. But it\u2019s time to move beyond the oversimplification that large-scale agriculture is incompatible with environmental goals. There are vast areas of the tropics with similar soils. They are likely to be the megafarms of the future. We need to admit that food production is going to be the dominant use of land in the 21st century, and to decide whether we are going to farm more land or farm more intensively. Then we can move on to the grand challenge of making our farms sustainable. Stephen Porder is an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Brown University. Hye Jin Chung",

        "content": " LAS VEGAS \u2014 However big and ambitious you think Amazon\u2019s plan to run the world\u2019s computing may be, you should probably think bigger. In a startling talk Thursday evening, a vice president who oversees the internal engineering of Amazon\u2019s global computing system described how Amazon is building its own specialized computers, data storage systems, networking systems, even power substations and optical transmissions systems. In every case, he said, Amazon Web Services had developed ways to make its computers run cheaper and more efficiently than standard commercial products. \u201cWe\u2019re changing everything everywhere,\u201d said James Hamilton, vice president and distinguished engineer at Amazon Web Services. \u201cAll of our engineers are focused\u201d on reducing the costs of computing. He was speaking at Amazon\u2019s second annual gathering of A.W.S. customers, partner companies and analysts, an event that drew 9,000 people. For Amazon, which rarely talks about Amazon Web Services, it was an unusually frank and detailed explanation of a system on which the company is thought to spend perhaps $1 billion annually (Amazon officials would not confirm this number, but did not dispute it when asked directly.) Amazon\u2019s data storage system, Mr. Hamilton said, handles 1.5 million requests a second, and holds trillions of \u201cobjects,\u201d or individual stored items. Its custom-built storage machines pack their systems far more densely than the most advanced commercial systems, he said, and weigh over a ton. The first database system he\u2019d worked on professionally, Mr. Hamilton said, was considered cutting edge when it ran 69 transactions a second. A.W.S. has built power substations with capacity in excess of 50 megawatts to have sufficient power for the computing it expects to have within two years. Amazon has hired power engineers to rethink power redundancy in cloud computing. With luck, that may help avoid the kind of   disruptions  that have taken the system down in the past. Mr. Hamilton later said privately that Amazon had developed original statistical methods to limit damage from catastrophic failures. Every significant component, including semiconductors and disk drives, is purchased directly, to keep the price down and to manage a chain of supply, assembly and installation that adds every day the equivalent of all the computing Amazon owned in 2004. \u201cEvery day. On the weekend, too,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. In part, the talk was an acknowledgement that large competitors like  Microsoft   and  Google   are now gunning for A.W.S. With competitors, Amazon now has to engage in a customer outreach that fronts Amazon\u2019s technical prowess. Big public cloud computing \u201cis such an obviously good market that we know every major player will be in it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still want all the jobs on A.W.S.\u201d Mr. Hamilton also stressed that global clouds operated with a scale and velocity that enables efficiencies individual companies can\u2019t get running their own cloud systems. For example, by handling the peak loads of tax preparers in April and the peak loads of retailers in December, A.W.S. servers run at a higher and more efficient rate, annualized, than any individual company can realize. This was an indirect attack on  VMware ,  Dell   and other companies offering private clouds to corporations. Scale was also the central reason for many of the technical achievements Amazon listed in the talk. Mr. Hamilton also said A.W.S. now owned its own optical fiber systems, which should enable it to manage the system on a global basis, and possibly improve its sometimes spotty performance. \u201cWe invest in long-haul fiber,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s happening.\u201d In addition to purchasing commercial systems, A.W.S. has developed its own series of networking methods that Mr. Hamilton said \u201care now on a Moore\u2019s Law path,\u201d meaning performance relative to cost is doubling every two years, and operating on systems with 64 computing cores per chip. Currently no major commercial networking company consistently achieves that sustained cost performance. While it\u2019s possible that Amazon will continue its openness and share its discoveries with the world. Mr. Hamilton also said Amazon was not interested in participating in industry standards discussions, which could publicize its many technical advances. \u201cStandards say, \u2018you must do this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t like \u2018you must.\u2019\u201d In fairness, Google publishes some technical papers about its big computers, but does not talk about things like the semiconductors it has developed internally to handle computing at this scale. There are so few companies able to operate that this level that every aspect of systems, even electricity usage, is considered by these companies to be potentially significant proprietary knowledge. The notable outrider among the giant computers is  Facebook , which isn\u2019t selling its own system. Instead, Facebook is focused on pure cost-cutting, and spearheads the Open Compute Project, a kind of open-source, cloud-computing architecture. Open Compute is far enough along that companies like Hewlett-Packard, which came late to cloud computing, use aspects of it in their public clouds.

On Wednesday Amazon indicated that its ambitions were potentially much bigger \u2014 it wants to provide desktop computing to all the mobile devices in the world and remake mobile gaming. At a developer conference in Las Vegas, A.W.S. announced Amazon WorkSpaces, a way to provide applications, documents and computing resources to laptops and tablets, including iPads, Android tablets and Amazon Kindle Fires. Prices vary from $35 to $60 a month per user, depending on how much computing power and storage someone wants. A license for Microsoft Office and some antivirus software is another $15 a month per person. It\u2019s hard to say just how many tech companies Amazon is rattling with this one. Google, with its Chromebooks and Google Drive, which already offer cheap ways to do computing online, is one candidate. Microsoft is selling licenses, but potentially losing out on operating system revenue, if this succeeds. All the major makers of personal computers and, yes, laptops, could also be affected if someone makes an Android-based desktop terminal that could be sold as a cheap way to equip call centers or offices. \u201cNo hardware, no software, no long-term commitments,\u201d said Andy Jassy, the head of A.W.S. \u201cYou can access this at half the price of a typical infrastructure desktop solution.\u201d This is not a slam dunk, however. While virtual desktops are on the market, usually offered as a way to give information technology departments a lot of low-cost centralized control, in general the systems have not sold well. Even Google\u2019s Chrome desktop product has disappointed. The product will come out in limited release, probably meaning A.W.S. wants to see how well it can operate these systems. The other new business, called Amazon AppStream, enables developers of mobile games to deliver what Amazon said was the consistent streaming experience of high-quality gaming \u2014 the kind associated with a Microsoft Xbox or a Sony PlayStation \u2014 to a smartphone or tablet. Using AppStream, A.W.S. examines a device\u2019s characteristics and connectivity, and according to the company will be able to send even complex, three-dimensional games to a user in a consistent manner. Like WorkSpaces, the service will start out in limited release. AppStream is one of several mobile development offerings that A.W.S. has been rolling out over the last couple of years, including data analytics, ad networks for mobile devices and purchasing systems. While currently limited to mobile development, many of these services could conceivably reach other businesses, like Web page development and virtual desktops, with relatively modest modifications. That is the kind of thing Amazon has done before, starting with A.W.S.\u2019s origins as a service for Amazon\u2019s own operations. Thursday morning, A.W.S. also announced tweaks to its databases that it said would make gaming, mobile and ad placement technology faster and more powerful.

But as Mr. Bharara\u2019s profile has risen with a number of prominent cases \u2014 including the recent criminal charges against SAC Capital Advisors \u2014 his future has become a topic of speculation on Wall Street. Will he move to a high-paying job in the private sector, as other public servants have done? Or does he not need the money? Mr. Bharara is rumored to be independently wealthy, the result of an early investment in his younger brother\u2019s company, Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to  Amazon.com   for $540 million in 2010, as DealBook\u2019s Peter Lattman noted at the DealBook conference on Tuesday. Is that indeed true? Is he independently wealthy? Mr. Bharara demurred. \u201cNot compared to the people in this room,\u201d he said, to an auditorium filled with business people.

In addition, the prosecutor touched on some familiar themes, such as the importance of holding institutions \u2014 and not just individuals \u2014 accountable for wrongdoing. He also discussed budget constraints, saying his office was in a hiring freeze. As for his plans when he does retire, Mr. Bharara paraphrased a line from \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to walk the earth,\u201d said Mr. Bharara, quoting Samuel L.

        "name": "Postal Service, with Amazon deal, steals a march on its rivals; Packages to be delivered on Sundays, starting this holiday shopping season ",
        "content": " The cash-short United States Postal Service, which has failed to win congressional approval to stop delivering mail on Saturdays to save money, has struck a deal with Amazon.com to deliver the company\u2019s packages on Sundays \u2014 a first for both, with obvious advantages for each. For the Postal Service, which last year reported a loss of nearly $16 billion, first-class mail delivery, particularly on Saturdays, is often a money loser, whereas package delivery is profitable. The deal, announced on Sunday and taking effect immediately, in time for the holiday shopping season, gives the Postal Service a chance to take some business from United Parcel Service and FedEx, which do not deliver on Sundays. Now, some orders that would have been handled by either of those carriers for Monday delivery will go through the Postal Service and arrive on Sunday. The Postal Service said it expected to make more such deals with other merchants, seeking a larger role in the $186 billion market for electronic commerce. Amazon.com would not say whether it would try to arrange Sunday deliveries with other parcel carriers. For this holiday shopping season, Sunday delivery of Amazon products will be limited to the Los Angeles and New York metropolitan areas, which in New York\u2019s case includes parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. In 2014, it is expected to expand to other cities including Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix. Among the primary beneficiaries of the new delivery schedule will be Amazon Prime members, who pay an annual fee for premium services including free two-day shipping for certain items, said Kelly Cheeseman, a spokeswoman for Amazon. \u2018\u2018Now every day can be an Amazon delivery day,\u2019\u2019 she said. Postal Service officials called the agreement an important step in diversifying its services and expanding those that make a profit. \u2018\u2018Consumers have shown that there is a market for package deliveries seven days a week, and we are glad to be in a position to partner with Amazon on providing this service,\u2019\u2019 said Patrick R. Donahoe, the postmaster general. Neither Amazon nor the Postal Service would disclose financial arrangements or discuss the volume or revenue they expected to generate from Sunday deliveries. The Postal Service already delivers some packages on Sundays and holidays for an extra fee. Shipping and package services have been one of the few bright spots for the beleaguered Postal Service. First-class mail, its main source of revenue, declined to almost 69 billion pieces last year from nearly 92 billion in 2008. That contributed to a decline in revenue to $65 billion in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 2012, from nearly $75 billion in 2008. Shipping and package volume has increased to about 3.5 billion pieces since 2008, and accounts for about $11.6 billion in revenue for the agency. Mr. Donahoe, the postmaster general, said the deal with Amazon was part of the Postal Service\u2019s attempt to alter its business model. That effort includes increasing package delivery to take advantage of the growth of e-commerce, streamlining the work force and eliminating mail delivery on Saturdays. Though the Postal Service would continue to deliver packages on Saturdays, the proposal to halt Saturday delivery has met resistance from the business sector and some members of Congress. A move to cut Saturday delivery would save about $2 billion annually, postal officials said. The agency faces myriad problems that have led to its financial decline. It faces legal constraints that prevent it from diversifying into certain lines of business. It is also barred from raising postage prices faster than the rate of inflation. But an even bigger cause of the financial decline is a 2006 law that requires the Postal Service, unlike any other government agency, to pay $5.5 billion a year into a health fund for its future retirees. The majority of the agency\u2019s losses since 2007, about $32 billion, result from the health funding requirement, financial documents show. As a result of its financial troubles, the Postal Service has defaulted on three annual $5.5 billion payments into the health care fund. It has also exhausted its $15 billion borrowing limit from the Treasury Department. More recently the agency has asked for permission to raise its postage prices to help cover costs. Congress is considering legislation that would overhaul the agency and ease the financial constraints, but few anticipate a bill passing this year as lawmakers continue to wrestle with broader budget issues. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve got to get this done,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Donahoe said. \u2018\u2018The faster we can get it done, the faster we can focus attention away from all the negative attention about our financial situation and onto the positive things we do, like this new agreement with Amazon.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "An Offer From Amazon to Its Most Bitter Rivals ",
        "content": " SAN FRANCISCO \u2014  Amazon   is going to the people who dislike and fear it the most \u2014 independent bookstore owners \u2014 and offering to work together to fulfill the needs and desires of their customers. The retailer on Wednesday announced a program where stores can sell its popular reading devices. The booksellers would get a small payment on each sale and a commission on all e-books that the reader buys in the next two years. It was a great deal, booksellers said \u2014 for Amazon. \u201cI seriously doubt that many independent stores will take them up on it,\u201d said Bill Petrocelli, co-owner of two stores in the Bay Area. Many booksellers are distrustful of Amazon, a company of boundless ambition and  some aggressive ways . Stores dismissed the new program as a Trojan horse aimed at further undermining their business. Independents make up about 10 percent of book sales, down from as much as 25 percent before Amazon. \u201cWe help Amazon grow its business and, in return, get a thin slice of the sale?\u201d asked J. B. Dickey at Seattle Mystery Bookshop. \u201cThat\u2019s not cooperation. That\u2019s being complicit in your execution.\u201d Jason Bailey, co-owner of another Washington store, JJ Books in Bothell, had a more nuanced view. He has already signed up with the program and was featured on Wednesday on the Amazon site. \u201cI have people coming in with their e-book readers to look at my books and then buy them online,\u201d Mr. Bailey said in an interview. \u201cI may have helped sell the book, but I generated income for someone else. Now I have a chip in the game.\u201d An Amazon spokeswoman, Kinley Pearsall, said she did not have the total number of retailers in the program. (One other bookstore, a college store in Washington, was featured on the site.) \u201cI can tell you anecdotally that the interest we\u2019ve seen since announcing this morning has been very strong,\u201d Ms. Pearsall said. Amazon has lost valuable real estate for its Kindle line of e-readers in recent years, as its brick-and-mortar competitors have dropped the devices from their stores. Last year, both Target and Walmart said they would no longer sell the Kindle. The new program, Amazon Source, lets stores either buy Kindles for a 6 percent discount and receive 10 percent of the revenue from e-books that customers purchase, or gives them a 9 percent discount without any other payment. The cheapest Kindle is $69. Most e-books are about $12, although many self-published ones are much less or even free. Amazon\u2019s aggressive discounting of physical books as well as its creation of an e-book empire have helped thin the ranks of independent bookstores over the last decade. But the stores scored at least a temporary victory with the lackluster performance of Amazon\u2019s publishing program, which offered up a handful of big names to weak sales. One reason: The independents refused to sell the books. Amazon portrayed Amazon Source as a win for both parties. \u201cCustomers don\u2019t have to choose between e-books and their favorite neighborhood bookstore \u2014 they can have both,\u201d an executive, Russ Grandinetti, said in a news release. But even Mr. Bailey, who got early word of the program through a soccer buddy who works at Amazon, sees risks. \u201cI had to debate whether this is the next nail in my coffin, the next step down into the grave,\u201d he said. Switching metaphors, he added, \u201cBut I decided to step into the whirlwind.\u201d His hope is that a customer will buy a Kindle from him, and yet remain a customer for physical books in forms that are not yet popular in electronic formats: children\u2019s books, for example. His three-year-old store will get a modest but presumably steady commission on e-book purchases. Other bookstore owners said any potential income was negligible, but the potential problems were enormous. When stores sell a Kobo reader, for example, customers can buy their e-books directly from the store itself, creating a tighter relationship. But when a customer buys a Kindle, the e-books come from Amazon. Another problem is letting Amazon scoop up even more data about who is buying what. \u201cOur customers are buying e-books from us that are way more eclectic than people are buying from Amazon,\u201d said Michael Tucker, owner of Books Inc., a San Francisco chain of 12 stores. \u201cGiving away that information would be like giving away the farm for a nickel.\u201d Amazon has had some public relations setbacks recently. An in-depth look at the company by Brad Stone, a former New York Times reporter, written with official cooperation, presented a view of Amazon as a Darwinian snake pit. This week Amazon fired back, denouncing \u201cThe Everything Store\u201d as one-sided. With that as a backdrop, booksellers were not inclined to see any proposal from Amazon in a benign light. \u201cI was kind of wondering if it was April Fools\u2019 Day,\u201d said Karen Hayes, a co-owner of Parnassus Books in Nashville.

        "content": " Not long ago, I was on the set of a show about politics, Washington and a senator gone rogue. The set had all the trappings of a big-time television production, but it will be delivered not by broadcast or cable, but over the Internet by a technology company that has not historically been in the business of original productions. No, this was not \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the  Netflix   drama that received a lot of attention and an Emmy for best director. \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d was actually being filmed about 200 miles to the south, in Baltimore. I was in Queens watching a comedy called \u201cAlpha House,\u201d written by Garry Trudeau, the creator of the comic \u201cDoonesbury,\u201d that pivots around the substantial acting and physical presence of John Goodman. \u201cAlpha House,\u201d which will have its premiere on Nov. 15, is the first attempt at original programming by  Amazon.com . It\u2019s a small bet by a very big company, but one that could create additional momentum for the further disruption of what we still call television but is quickly becoming something more complicated and interesting. The program is loosely based on  a house that served as a crash pad   for four Democrats in Washington, including Senators Charles E. Schumer and Richard J. Durbin, and Representatives George Miller and Bill Delahunt. Except on \u201cAlpha House,\u201d the four men are all senators, all Republicans and all flawed in ways that give the comedy impulse plenty of room to roam. Mr. Goodman\u2019s character, Gil John Biggs, is a revered former basketball coach of the University of North Carolina Tar Heels and now a Republican senator from that state who is confronting a  Tea Party   challenge from Digger Mancusi, the current Duke coach. In a scene filmed last month, Mr. Biggs is bathing in post-gaffe regret \u2014 we will avoid spoilers here \u2014 trying to deal with a video gone \u201cvirile,\u201d as he describes it. When an aide tells him there are in fact six deeply embarrassing videos making the rounds on the Internet, Mr. Biggs\u2019s face becomes a portrait of hatred for this modern age. He swears lustily, and then moans, \u201cIt\u2019s like the Clemson game all over again!\u201d After his wife and aide suggest that he go on a morning show as part of an apology tour, he swears again, and says, \u201cI don\u2019t need to humanize myself! I\u2019m plenty human.\u201d Washington\u2019s feet of clay are all the rage on television right now \u2014 there\u2019s \u201cScandal\u201d on ABC, \u201cVeep\u201d on HBO and, of course, \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d \u2014 but another trend is afoot. Big Internet players like Netflix and Amazon are stepping up their efforts in original programming, competing for viewers in the world of streaming. In the instances of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cAlpha House,\u201d they are even presenting the same general subject matter, albeit taking different approaches \u2014 \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is a whodunit-to-whom drama while \u201cAlpha House\u201d is full-contact comedy. The reasons are obvious, even if the economics are a little opaque. Both companies want a substantial footprint on your various devices, and to be part of the television ecosystem, they decided they had to make \u201ctelevision.\u201d In doing so, they become less of a hostage to the traditional content providers while putting consumers on notice that interesting television, if that is what it is, can come from all kinds of places. That lesson had to be learned by content creators as well. \u201cAlpha House\u201d had been percolating for a while with Mr. Trudeau, who wrote \u201cTanner 88\u201d for HBO. He and Jonathan Alter, the journalist and author, have been taking trips to the New Hampshire primary for the last 20 years, and the concept came up again in 2012. Mr. Alter took the idea to Amazon. \u201cI had no interest in making YouTube videos and didn\u2019t really understand that Amazon was getting into full-fledged productions,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cIt soon became clear that they were willing to put significant resources into original content.\u201d The business models \u2014 and the marquee programs \u2014 of Netflix and Amazon bear surface similarities, but different agendas are at work. Netflix is a pure-play entertainment company that  uses data, licensed content and   streaming distribution   to build an audience of subscribers \u2014 similar to cable, but without the actual cable. \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and other original shows help the company keep subscribers happy and earn new ones. In that sense, the programming, or the play, is the thing. For Amazon, programming is an add-on, a benefit of being a member of Amazon Prime. In addition to free two-day shipping, the company\u2019s 11 million Prime members have access to Amazon Prime Instant Video, with more than 40,000 movies and television episodes, and beginning next week, \u201cAlpha House.\u201d The first three episodes will be available on Nov. 15, free to all Amazon customers, and additional episodes will then be available to subscribers of Amazon Prime every week. Lest you think Amazon is simply being generous, it is important to note that Prime members reportedly spend 150 percent more on the site after joining. You get the drift: Come for \u201cAlpha House\u201d and stick around to buy a big new flat-screen to watch it on. It\u2019s not cheap or easy to make content. Variety estimated that the company is  spending $1 million to $2 million an   episode   on original programming and will not reap immediate profits, but Amazon is playing a longer game. It\u2019s part of  the so-called flywheel effect , a business theory that suggests that adding small features to a core business \u2014 in Amazon\u2019s case, selling millions of products online \u2014 makes the wheel spin faster, helping you add customers and achieve efficiencies through increased scale. The strategy \u2014 programming as a throw-in bonus for consumers \u2014 has the potential to complicate the industry enormously, but Amazon\u2019s approach is unorthodox as well. The big networks engage in a hugely inefficient pilot process \u2014 by the time executives finish choosing the handful of programs that will be broadcast, the aftermath looks like an episode of \u201cWalking Dead,\u201d with very expensive carcasses littering the landscape. Amazon instead used its reach \u2014 it has 215 million customers worldwide \u2014 to create a vast focus group. In the spring, the company made 14 pilots available for viewing and rating. \u201cAlpha House\u201d ended up highly rated enough for a crowd-sourced green light, along with \u201cBetas,\u201d a comedy about a start-up in Silicon Valley. (Insert your own joke here about the first two original series being named Alpha and Beta.) \u201cThe data part of it is basically a black box to us,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cI was flabbergasted by their mode of decision-making, that we were going to put something out there as troll bait, but they generated the numbers and have entrusted me with what is equivalent to a midsized corporation, so I guess the kingdom of Big Data came back positive.\u201d It was more than that, said Roy Price, director of Amazon Studios. \u201cWe try to put together some of the things from traditional TV and Amazon\u2019s tradition of listening to customers, so in that sense, it is a hybrid,\u201d he said. \u201cWith \u2018Alpha House,\u2019 a lot of people responded to the cast and Garry\u2019s sense of humor. It\u2019s a comedy that brings insights into a world people are familiar with, and it clearly resonated with Amazon Prime customers.\u201d Mr. Alter said it represented a shift of sorts. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s sort of refreshing, taking some of the power away from the suits and letting people help decide,\u201d he said. Still, it\u2019s more or less the same to the people in front of the camera, including Mr. Goodman, who broke through as the sitcom husband on \u201cRoseanne.\u201d \u201cThis one has a different distribution platform, but this,\u201d he said, gesturing around to the crew, the equipment and the sets, \u201cis a TV show. A good one, we hope.\u201d Email: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter: @carr2n John Goodman, center, on the set of \u201cAlpha House,\u201d Amazon\u2019s first original series, in Queens. | Chang W.

        "content": " A couple of weeks ago, a street team from  Sendapackage.com   was standing on a sidewalk near Columbus Circle in Manhattan talking with a dozen women about to board a charter bus that would take them upstate to visit their relatives in prison. It was 10 p.m. and many of the women huddled in the darkness were toting sleepy children; most were also burdened with plastic bags of Pop Tarts, pretzels, cookies and potato chips \u2014 junk food unavailable to men behind bars. The team from Sendapackage, which could be thought of as prison\u2019s version of Amazon.com, was handing out glossy catalogs offering New York\u2019s 50,000 inmates hundreds of items for purchase and delivery: soft drinks, cigarettes, canned ravioli, cotton hoodies and \u2014 perhaps most popular of all \u2014 music on cassette tape, the only format that corrections regulations will allow. \u201cWe\u2019ve got same-day shipping and a 10 percent discount on first-time orders,\u201d the team\u2019s coordinator, Zerimar Ramirez (or Mr. Z), was telling the group. As some of the women flipped with interest through the product line, a video crew stood ready if any of them cared to go on camera and provide a  testimonial . Though it might surprise many who have no experience with prison, sending packages to loved ones doing time can be, as thousands of local families know, a Kafkaesque process. Beyond the hassle of going to several stores to assemble a package, and then having to take it to the post office or UPS, is navigating a welter of rules governing what is allowable. The New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision publishes a  list , currently more than 20 pages long, of who can send what, and how, and what is permitted and what is not. Food cannot contain poppy seeds; emery boards must be \u201cnonmetallic\u201d; boxer shorts and briefs must be of a solid color only. \u201cI thought there had to be a better way,\u201d said Chris Barrett, Sendapackage\u2019s founder, who seems to have discovered that way on the Internet. The items that Mr. Barrett\u2019s service sells online (as well as through its catalog) have all been chosen in advance to adhere to the extensive directives put in place for gifts by the corrections department. His selection is comprehensive and diverse enough that the company bills itself as \u201cNew York\u2019s inmate superstore.\u201d In a city that appears more and more to be colonized by corporate-funded start-ups, Sendapackage, which is two years old, has an exceptionally personal creation myth. The idea came to Mr. Barrett in 2008, not long after his younger brother, Robert Maffei, was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for a murder in Brooklyn. When he was 19, Mr. Maffei  killed a man   after firing a pistol from a moving car. After he was put away, Mr. Barrett, who had himself served six years on a mob-related gun charge, tried to send him some deodorant and a package of salami at the Sullivan Correctional Facility, in Fallsburg. Mr. Barrett was unaware that the items had been made with alcohol, which is forbidden inside prison. As he recounts the story, a guard disposed of his well-intentioned gifts as soon as they arrived. \u201cEventually I started hearing that other people \u2014 wives and moms who didn\u2019t know the rules, who didn\u2019t have time to go shopping \u2014 were having the same problem,\u201d Mr. Barrett said. \u201cI began to sense there was a need here, a real need.\u201d Though he had worked in marketing and been a nightclub co-owner after his release from prison, Mr. Barrett at that point had no experience as a digital entrepreneur. So he took a year, he said, pricing items, building a website and developing relationships with vendors \u2014 \u201cEverything we needed,\u201d he explained, \u201cto pitch the idea.\u201d In late 2010, after several months of looking for an angel, he finally persuaded a Brooklyn businessman to fund his nascent venture with a personal check for $1.5 million. Within six months, Mr. Barrett had rented space in a warehouse in the Bronx and quickly filled its shelves with basic items: brushed-twill baseball caps, cans of  Beefaroni . As time went by, he added to his inventory, gradually expanding into watches, gummi bears, stereo headphones and exfoliating moisturizing creams. Last year, he struck what was his biggest and most promising deal to date, persuading Universal Records to produce, on cassette, a line of new music popular with inmates. Compact discs are not allowed in prison because they can be broken into shivs. But arguing that he had access to an audience that was literally captive, Mr. Barrett persuaded Universal to manufacture a limited supply of R&B and hip-hop tapes, in an exclusive arrangement, provided that he bought them on consignment and in bulk. \u201cNo one makes cassette tapes anymore,\u201d Mr. Barrett said, still sounding vaguely amazed. \u201cI\u2019m probably the only guy on the planet with Kanye West\u2019s new album on tape.\u201d Judging by the letters he has received, Mr. Barrett, who is slim of build and 40, has managed to transform himself into something like the R. H. Macy of the state prison system. \u201cWhile looking through your catalog, a couple of things caught my eye,\u201d one customer, in the Downstate Correctional Facility, wrote. \u201cYour prices, which are very reasonable, and your wide selection of things, such as sneakers, boots, headsets, blankets, winter coats, thermals, books, TVs, radios, beard trimmers and cosmetics.\u201d Even the state corrections department, an agency not known for its entrepreneurial spirit, has quietly supported Mr. Barrett\u2019s efforts. Declining to comment specifically on Sendapackage, Tom Mailey, a department spokesman, said, \u201cFrom our point of view, any vendor that is compliant with the rules and regulations and directives regarding packages will work for us.\u201d On an ordinary day, Sendapackage handles up to 40 orders. About a third are placed online by relatives on the outside; most of the rest arrive from inside prisons by telephone or mail. Mr. Barrett said the average order was usually in the neighborhood of $110. With seven employees, he currently serves all of New York\u2019s 58 state prisons, and he would like to expand into neighboring Pennsylvania and into states like Texas and California, which have very large numbers of inmates. After paying for its inventory, Sendapackage earns about $800,000 a year, Mr. Barrett said. He said he was simply waiting to accrue sufficient capital to grow. \u201cWe\u2019re not making a killing yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting there.\u201d While some might be squeamish about having a criminal customer base, Mr. Barrett, perhaps because of his own incarceration, offers the same kinds of promotions and perks that businesses whose clients are on the outside use: He offers inmates a 10 percent discount on orders near their birthdays, for example (\u201cThank you for the generous gift certificate!\u201d another customer wrote), and he donates 5 percent of his profits to a charity called  In   Arm\u2019s Reach , which gives assistance to children with incarcerated parents. Using his connections to the hip-hop world, made through his nightclubs and the cassette-tape deal, Mr. Barrett also hosts parties for his clients\u2019 families, including one last Thanksgiving at which the local rapper  Jadakiss   appeared. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough experience when somebody you love goes away,\u201d said Mr. Ramirez, the street-team coordinator who once served as the head of security at  the Griffin , Mr. Barrett\u2019s nightclub in the meatpacking district. \u201cSo on top of everything else, we try to do a few events every year that are fun.\u201d As far as business models go, Sendapackage\u2019s is more or less recession-proof, and as Mr. Barrett noted, its target demographic is extremely loyal. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a business,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere you can get and keep a customer for as long as we keep ours.\u201d Chris Barrett, Sendapackage.com\u2019s founder, with some of his wares. | Michael Kamber for The New York Times | In Manhattan recently, Sendapackage employees passed out catalogs to relatives of inmates. | Michael Kamber for The New York Times | Zerimar Ramirez showing products to a woman waiting in Midtown Manhattan for a bus to take her to see her son in prison. | Michael Kamber for The New York Times",

        "content": " Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon By Brad Stone Illustrated. 372 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $28. About a quarter of the way into \u201cThe Everything Store,\u201d Brad Stone\u2019s engrossing chronicle of the rise of Jeff Bezos and Amazon, he reveals that in the late 1990s, Bezos seriously contemplated trying to collect two copies of every book ever printed and store them in a warehouse in Lexington, Ky. Called the Alexandria Project, a k a Noah\u2019s Ark, the initiative never got out of dry dock. And Lexington had no idea about its near miss with biblical importance. Project Fargo was even more ambitious: a proposal to fill a warehouse with one of every product ever manufactured. \u201cThis is the most critical project in Amazon\u2019s history,\u201d Bezos is said to have declared. It wasn\u2019t, but it gives you a sense of the man\u2019s penchant for grandiose ideas. These \u201cfever dreams,\u201d as employees called them, bring to mind Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s sublime story \u201cThe Library of Babel,\u201d in which the writer describes a \u201ctotal\u201d library \u2014 a huge stockpile of every possible arrangement of a 25-symbol alphabet in 410-page books with 40-line pages and 80-letter lines. The idea is classic Borges, evoking a sense of the infinite despite the easily calculable (if still mind-numbingly large) number of books. Somewhere in there, his narrator observes, \u201cthere must exist a book that is the . . . compendium of all other books, and some librarian must have examined that book; this librarian is analogous to a god.\u201d Well, Bezos is the god in Stone\u2019s story, and definitely one of the vengeful and punishing sort, at least when it comes to those who have worked for him, those he has competed against and those who thought, mistakenly, they were in some sort of partnership with him. (That leaves his family, whom we\u2019re told he loves dearly.) Stone obviously admires his subject, but it\u2019s hard to tell if he likes him. For that matter, it\u2019s hard to tell if anybody likes him. Worth $27 billion, Bezos still makes employees pay for parking and for a time posted private ambulances outside warehouses during heat waves instead of ponying up for extra air-conditioners. It comes across loud and clear just how painful working anywhere near Bezos seems to have been over the years, despite halfhearted attempts by employees to recast a total lack of empathy as some sort of trick of leadership: one of his \u201cgifts,\u201d they say, is \u201cto drive and motivate his employees without getting overly attached to them personally.\u201d Is that a gift? It may be in actual war, but I\u2019ll bet soldiers in the Middle East get more than free Gatorade and an extra 10 minutes of break time a day when the temperature tops 100 degrees. It\u2019s always lonely at the top, though, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s where Bezos finds himself in 2013, less than 20 years into the building of a $140 billion company that has 200 million active customers. He has to be superhuman on some level, as the mere reading of his story makes you feel exhausted on his behalf. Even Zeus would have had trouble fighting so many simultaneous battles on so many fronts: against Wall Street naysayers, Barnes & Noble, Wal-Mart, Apple, eBay, Google, the book publishing industry, Netflix, state-tax collectors and the like. There are those who draw nourishment from conflict, and Bezos does appear to revel in outwitting even his best partners. The publishing industry, for example, still doesn\u2019t quite know how it willingly gave him the sword with which he would slice off its head. And Stone only hints at this one, but it\u2019s a doozy: despite Amazon\u2019s assurance to some manufacturers that it will reduce prices below suggested retail only to stay true to its lowest-price guarantee, \u201cmysterious third-party sellers\u201d tend to show up on the site with conveniently lower prices, which Amazon then matches with a \u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d shrug. What else? Here\u2019s one suggestion: Confirm that those third-party suppliers are indeed what they claim they are and not, say, Amazon itself. It\u2019s amazing how much has happened at a company so young. First, Bezos pretty much proved the power of the \u201clong tail.\u201d Then he kick-started online affiliate marketing, paying other Web sites to send customers his way. Next: 1-Click, which proved that the odds of our buying something online increase significantly when you save us five seconds. Are we really that impatient? Don\u2019t ask Bezos, who might respond with one of his notorious (and, truth be told, often humorous) put-downs: \u201cDoes it surprise you that you don\u2019t know the answer to that question?\u201d The list goes on: Amazon Marketplace, Amazon Prime, Kindle, Amazon Web Services, Amazon Instant Video. If that sounds like enough to monopolize one man\u2019s attention, you\u2019re wrong. Bezos also runs his own venture capital business and has been an early investor in Google, Twitter, Uber and Business Insider, among others. Then there\u2019s his recent acquisition of a little journalistic outlet you might have heard of: The Washington Post. Some of his achievements are awesomely complicated \u2014 like Amazon\u2019s profitable effort to solve the \u201csystem of polynomial equations\u201d that allows for the most efficient delivery of customer orders from one or more of the company\u2019s dozens of fulfillment centers. But Stone\u2019s long tenure covering both Bezos and Amazon (first at Newsweek, then at The New York Times and now at Bloomberg Businessweek) gives his retelling a sureness that keeps the story moving swiftly, even in passages where Amazon\u2019s ever-present (and apparently intentional) internal chaos threatens to spill out onto the pages of the book itself. Stone does know when to provide a breather with entertaining anecdotes about Amazon\u2019s competitive jujitsu. For instance: During the 1999 holiday season, the managers of Amazon\u2019s fledgling toy division were worried they wouldn\u2019t be able to meet surging demand for Pok\u00e9mon toys. So they bought out the entire Pok\u00e9mon inventory of the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Web site, which shipped it to Amazon free. Amazon surely sold the toys at a loss. But guess who had happier customers that year? Bezos deserves his place in the pantheon of businessmen. Yet Stone also makes a great case for him as a replacement for Bill Gates as head of the Army of Geek Billionaires. This is a guy who has made decisions using a \u201cregret-minimization framework\u201d and whose love of \u201cStar Trek\u201d is such that he considered naming Amazon MakeItSo.com, a reference to one of Captain Picard\u2019s signature lines. Even before he founded Blue Origin, a personal project aimed at enabling \u201cprivate human access to space,\u201d his high school girlfriend told reporters in the 1990s that \u201cthe reason he\u2019s earning so much money is to get to outer space.\u201d Stone makes much of Bezos\u2019 prescience, which no doubt seems to be more finely tuned than most people\u2019s. Bezos long ago figured out the trick to a kind of experimentation Samsung uses against Apple in the smartphone wars. Whereas Apple finely calibrates its new product designs, Samsung makes one of every size, color and shape imaginable and sees which end up selling. Amazon does the same sort of thing. That\u2019s not predicting the future, however, that\u2019s placing a bet on every horse in the race. Still, you\u2019ve got to give it to Bezos: It\u2019s also the surest way to make sure you\u2019re holding the winning ticket every time. Finally, let\u2019s not forget how many of Bezos\u2019 competitors seem unable to predict the present, let alone the future. Publishers were shocked when he sandbagged them with $9.99 e-book pricing in 2007. Where had they been? Stone points out the paradox of a book about Bezos being published by one of the companies Amazon\u2019s rise has threatened. But it\u2019s all in keeping with the story of the \u201ceverything store,\u201d which ultimately resembles an Escher drawing: these days, all retail roads do appear to begin and end with Amazon.

        "content": " It was perhaps inevitable that Amazon would have a rocky relationship with book publishers. Publishers are analog, Amazon is digital. Publishers are New York, Amazon is Seattle. The large publishers traditionally did not know much about their customers, and did not really care. Amazon knew a lot about customers and made the most of it. As for smaller houses, they were among Amazon's most fervent early supporters. Amazon talked a lot in the beginning about leveling the playing field for small publishers. It did, but then things went south. Brad Stone's new book, ''The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,'' vividly documents just how troubled the Amazon/publisher relationship became by about 2004. The retailer's critics, who worry about a culture where Amazon has eliminated all gatekeepers except itself, will not be reassured by this book. In negotiations with larger publishers, Mr. Stone writes, Amazon kept demanding more as it got bigger: steeper discounts, longer periods to pay and better shipping. Mr. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, then turned up the heat on the most vulnerable publishers -- those most dependent on Amazon. The company's relationship with those publishers was called the Gazelle Project after Mr. Bezos said Amazon ''should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.'' A joke, perhaps, but such an aggressive one that Amazon's lawyers demanded the Gazelle Project be renamed the Small Publishers Negotiation Program. Mr. Stone writes that Randy Miller, an Amazon executive in charge of a similar program in Europe, ''took an almost sadistic delight in pressuring book publishers to give Amazon more favorable financial terms.'' Mr. Miller would move their books to full price, take them off the recommendation engine or promote competing titles until he got better terms out of them, the book says. ''I did everything I could to screw with their performance,'' Mr. Miller told the writer. The program was called Pay to Play until the Amazon lawyers changed it to Vendor Realignment. Even some Amazon employees were literally sickened by how they had to behave, Mr. Stone writes. One book group employee said he had post-traumatic stress disorder for a year after quitting. Another was fired after he said it would be unethical to revisit a contract that had already been negotiated with Oxford University Press. Nearly a decade later, Amazon's hold on the bookselling market, both print and digital, is much greater than it was in those early days. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Stone's book, which was written with the cooperation of Mr. Bezos.",

        "content": " Laurence J. Kirshbaum, a stalwart of New York publishing  who joined Amazon in 2011   to lead its New York publishing imprint, will leave the company in January, Amazon said on Friday. Sarah Gelman, a spokeswoman for Amazon, said that Mr. Kirshbaum was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in starting Amazon\u2019s New York publishing office. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry to see him go,\u201d she said in an e-mail. Mr. Kirshbaum declined to comment. Daphne Durham, the publisher for Amazon Publishing\u2019s adult trade and children\u2019s businesses, will take over Mr. Kirshbaum\u2019s duties, Ms. Gelman said. Mr. Kirshbaum\u2019s departure is the latest sign that Amazon\u2019s publishing performance in New York has failed to meet the initial expectations. Traditional publishers worried at first about Amazon\u2019s growing power, and news reports speculated about whether New York was \u201cfacing a full-scale invasion from Seattle.\u201d Mr. Kirshbaum, whose background was in the more commercial side of publishing, was initially successful in signing some top authors, including Timothy Ferriss (\u201cThe Four-Hour Chef\u201d), Penny Marshall (\u201cMy Mother Was Nuts\u201d) and Billy Ray Cyrus (\u201cHillbilly Heart\u201d). But he was unable to persuade Barnes & Noble, the nation\u2019s largest bookstore chain, to sell Amazon\u2019s books in its stores. Independent booksellers, who tend to see Amazon as a discount retailer that undercuts their business, almost uniformly refused to sell its books. That damaged Amazon\u2019s ability to persuade authors and agents, who depend on print sales, to make deals with Amazon. Most book sales still come from print rather than digital. Benjamin Anastas, whose book \u201cToo Good to Be True\u201d was published by Amazon in 2012, said that he knew the lack of brick-and-mortar sales would be a \u201cstumbling block\u201d from the beginning. But Amazon executives promised that their Web site was a major advantage. \u201cThey said what they could depend on and what other publishers couldn\u2019t was that they have this incredible retail space, which is the Amazon online bookstore,\u201d Mr. Anastas said. While he said he would consider publishing with Amazon again, he acknowledged that \u201cit was frustrating not having the book in more bookstores.\u201d Shelf Awareness, an industry publication,  first reported   the news of Mr. Kirshbaum\u2019s departure. Mr. Kirshbaum, 69, began his career at Random House and eventually became the chairman and chief executive of the Time Warner Book Group. He retired in 2005 and became a literary agent. He is expected to return to work as an agent. In August, a sexual assault lawsuit was  filed against Mr. Kirshbaum   in Manhattan Supreme Court. His lawyer, Catherine Redich, declined to comment on the status of the case. Ms. Gelman of Amazon said that the New York office would continue to grow and that new imprints were expected to be introduced soon. Amazon Publishing includes imprints that are based in Seattle and focus on genre fiction like mystery, thrillers and romance.",

        "content": " SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon\u2019s third quarter followed a familiar script: it sold vast quantities of things, lost money while doing so, and investors were delighted. Revenue was $17.09 billion, up 24 percent and about $400 million more than predicted, the company said Thursday. But all that volume could not yield a profit. Amazon lost 9 cents a share, or $41 million, just like as had anticipated. Investors broke out the champagne. In after-hours trading, the stock was up $29, or 8 percent, to $361. The stock is up nearly tenfold since 2008. Amazon is the subject of an increasingly bitter debate about whether all of its investing in warehouses and new ventures will ever lead to solid profits. The bulls think the company is building an unassailable position as the most important retailer in the country. The bears point to things like this week\u2019s increase in the free shipping minimum to $35 from $25 as signs that Amazon must one day focus on the bottom line. For the moment, the bulls are very much in ascendance. Amazon had predicted that revenue in the third quarter would rise 12 to 24 percent. The results came in at the very top of that range. As for the loss, it was smaller than the 60 cents a share, or $274 million, the company lost last year. Much of the poor 2012 showing was related to an ill-fated investment in LivingSocial, a daily deals site. In a conference call with analysts, Tom Szkutak, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, focused on what he called \u201ca nice steady acceleration of growth\u201d in North America since last year\u2019s fourth quarter. But Mr. Szkutak was chary with specifics. Asked about a reference in the results to signing up \u201cmillions\u201d of new customers for the $79 Prime shipping service, he merely said, \u201cPrime is growing very fast.\u201d The results will nevertheless raise expectations for the fourth quarter. Amazon said sales might rise as little as 10 percent or as much as 25 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. And it warned it might once again lose money. \u201cAmazon is the teacher\u2019s pet of Wall Street,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research. \u201cThere is no other company in the entire world that has the consistently abominable rate of profitability they do and yet has the stratospheric valuation they do.\u201d Amazon has about 100 fulfillment centers \u2014 what in the old economy were called warehouses. It has streamlined the process of opening these centers, but it is still a tremendous expense. In the last 90 days, the company said, it began using eight million square feet of new warehouses. There is more to come. Amazon said this week that it would open new fulfillment centers in Hillsborough County and Lakeland, Fla., and in Baltimore. Sales Are Colossal, Shares Are Soaring. All Amazon Is Missing Is a  Profit Amazon has about 100 fulfillment centers, double the number it had a few years ago. | Matt Cardy/Getty Images | Employees at Amazon offices in Seattle. | Matthew Ryan Williams for The New York Times",

        "content": " Amazon.com tightened the requirements for one of its most popular shipping methods Tuesday morning. The change is to Super Saver Shipping, which for a over a decade mailed items free as long as the order met a $25 threshold. The new threshold: $35. Amazon gave no reason for the change. Super Saver Shipping was in many ways Amazon's best deal for people who were occasional-to-regular shoppers but did not need emergency orders of diapers. Why buy something for $20 and pay a few dollars shipping if you could buy two things and get them mailed for free? When Super Saver Shipping began, it was an innovation. It helped spark the movement to cheap or free shipping by all online retailers, and cemented Amazon's reputation as a cutthroat competitor. Here is the positive way to spin this announcement: This will tempt more customers to the Prime shipping service, which charges $79 a year for unlimited two-day delivery. It is thus a brilliant move by Amazon, which wants everyone to be Prime so they will buy more and more and keep raising revenue. Here is the negative way: This is the biggest rollback of benefits for Amazon's customers ever. Amazon incessantly talks about how it is doing more for its customers; this goes in the other direction. Customers will notice. ''I would often order two CDs to get the free shipping, but now that isn't going to happen,'' said Ariel Grostern of Washington. Here is the really negative way: Amazon is under stress. Paulo Santos, a widely read short-seller on the Seeking Alpha financial site, published a post after the news with the headline, ''Amazon.com Shipping Change Means The Earnings Miss Is Probably Massive.'' Mr. Santos quoted from Amazon's financial documents, where the company stresses, ''We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.'' ''What Amazon.com is doing is backtracking on this central tenet,'' Mr. Santos wrote. ''It would not do so lightly.'' The final spin: It will take more than this to dent investors' optimism. Amazon shares rose after the news broke. An Amazon spokesman had no comment.",

        "content": " It just bought an online education company and introduced a payment mechanism for Internet retailers that competes with PayPal. It started selling wine for the first time in New York, updated its line of tablets, gave the go-ahead to three new comedy pilots and began a design competition for its fashion division. It is setting up miniwarehouses inside suppliers like Procter & Gamble to ship goods faster. But one thing it will not be announcing this month: a significant profit. Who cares? Amazon lost money in 2012, and analysts are anticipating another loss when the company releases its third-quarter results on Thursday. Yet the stock is at a record high. Amazon shares are up about 150 percent since mid-2010, which perhaps not coincidentally was the last time the company had sizable profits. In other words, investors really decided they loved the company only when net income began to slide. \u2018\u2018This isn\u2019t supposed to happen,\u2019\u2019 said William H. Janeway, an economist and venture capitalist. \u2018\u2018It violates mainstream finance theory. Very few companies have been valued this way outside a systemic bubble.\u2019\u2019 No one is asserting that Amazon is a flat-out bubble, but there is an increasingly noisy debate about when it will \u2014 or even whether it can \u2014 deliver the sort of bottom-line profit that investors normally demand from a company expected to post $75 billion in revenue this year. The company declined to comment. Some analysts point out that those sales are negligible when set against the market being targeted by Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u2018\u2018The market is effectively limitless: All of global consumer commerce and maybe business-to-business commerce as well,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Janeway, author of \u2018\u2018Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy.\u2019\u2019 With that prize as the goal, making money today would be a positive hindrance. As Benedict Evans, an analyst in London, put it: \u2018\u2018Bezos has chosen to run Amazon to be the biggest, most powerful and successful retailer on earth 20 years from now. Any fool could run it profitably today.\u2019\u2019 Others argue that once a discounter, always a discounter. Amazon is branching out into many forms of commerce and technology, but at its core it sells commodity goods cheaply. A book from Amazon is the same book that it would be from any other retailer, and so is a package of diapers. Amazon also ships cheaply and has renowned customer service. To make a significant profit, though, some or all of those variables will have to change, and that might alienate customers and slow down that roaring revenue growth. That, in turn, would cause investors to demand a profit sooner. Best not to venture down that road, said Colin Gillis, senior technology analyst at BGC Partners. \u2018\u2018It is easier,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018to sell things and not make money than it is to sell things and make money.\u2019\u2019 In this view, Amazon\u2019s whirlwind of activity \u2014 a set-top box, thrusting it into more direct competition with Netflix, is expected to be announced any day, while the rumors of an Amazon smartphone will not cease \u2014 is merely a useful distraction from its retailing reality. The premise that Amazon can change its business model from selling other people\u2019s products at a razor-thin profit margin to selling other people\u2019s products at a large margin \u2018\u2018is not credible,\u2019\u2019 wrote Horace Dediu, an analyst with Asymco. Companies simply do not shift their business model so simply, he added, noting that Microsoft, for all its money and expertise, still could not reorient its PC-based strategy to take advantage of the trend to mobile computing. The current discussion about Amazon is reminiscent of the arguments about the company during the last systemic bubble, in 1999. Then, too, the corporate goal was to get big fast, to seize new markets before anyone else. But when the crash came, all the talk of unlimited potential disappeared. It was replaced by a fierce concentration on profit, which was described as being right around the corner. Mr. Bezos said in 2001 that the retailer would \u2018\u2018ferociously manage the products we carry so that we sell only products that are profitable. The 30-pound box of nails isn\u2019t long for our world.\u2019\u2019 Investors were mollified and the company survived. That was then. You can once again buy a box of 4,000 nails on Amazon (shipping weight: 38 pounds, or 17 kilograms) and have them delivered to your door free. But the retailer has gone far beyond such modest offers. The Thunderbird Cookie Dropping Machine costs $32,329 and weighs half a ton, but Amazon will also ship it free. (It is currently out of stock.) Commercial Food Services Equipment, a third-party vendor in Chicago, lists a Thunderbird for sale on Amazon, but charges almost $2,600 for shipping. \u2018\u2018Amazon will sell many more cookie dropping machines than I will, but even if you buy from me instead of Amazon, it will earn a commission on the sale and the shipping,\u2019\u2019 said Hyo Lee, the owner of Commercial Food. \u2018\u2018Now you know why Amazon\u2019s sales have gone from $34 billion in 2010 to $61 billion in 2012.\u2019\u2019 Still, she noted that Amazon was building dozens of warehouses around the United States and hiring tens of thousands of employees for them. \u2018\u2018It has all these fixed costs now,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018I think they\u2019ll have to start charging more for shipping.\u2019\u2019 Others agree that nothing grows to the sky forever. \u2018\u2018At some point, the piper must be paid,\u2019\u2019 said George Colony, the chief executive of Forrester Research. How? \u2018\u2018By raising prices. I don\u2019t see any other way.\u2019\u2019 At the edges, Amazon has started doing that, reining in a bit of its largess to the annoyance of some of its customers. For example, customers who paid $79 a year to join its Prime two-day shipping service used to be able to get really urgent things delivered the next day for an additional $3.99 an item. An Amazon customer named Perry Denton took full advantage of this when he bought a lawn mower. His Prime overnight fee was $3.99, Mr. Denton wrote in an Amazon forum. \u2018\u2018I kind of felt guilty, but I really needed a mower.\u2019\u2019 Last summer, devoted Prime users discovered that the company had started charging variable amounts according to size and weight, with a minimum of $2.99. A self-propelled Lawn Boy mower, for instance, is now $25 overnight. That is still a good deal, perhaps, but not as good as $3.99. The forum was full of complaints about how Prime customers were, as one of them put it, \u2018\u2018receiving less service for the same money.\u2019\u2019 Some who commented also wondered why there had been no announcement that the company was changing its shipping policies. An Amazon spokesman confirmed the change but said the company kept adding entertainment extras to Prime without raising the membership fee, including 41,000 movies and TV shows. Those three pilots it approved early this month, for instance, will be shown free to Prime customers. Amazon is reportedly losing as much as $1 billion a year on its streaming video service. Josh McFarland, chief executive of TellApart, a start-up that helps retailers manage their data, bought a $20 pair of flip-flops from Amazon. Then he found a pair he liked even more elsewhere, and prepared to return the Amazon set. The company told him not to bother. It would give him a refund anyway. Few retailers feel they can afford to be so generous, but other Amazon shoppers have recently reported the same experience. It is a game for the long term; will customers remember next year what you did for them today? \u2018\u2018What Amazon is trying to do is raise my expectations so that I\u2019ll eventually buy everything from it,\u2019\u2019 Mr. McFarland said. \u2018\u2018At some point it won\u2019t have any more competition, and I won\u2019t know if prices are being raised because I\u2019ll have nothing to compare it to.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "In switch, Walmart apes Amazon; Both retail giants\u2019 moves suggest stores and online are equally vital to them ",
        "content": " A plucky Silicon Valley company, having to compete for talented engineers, is trying it all: recruiting billboards on Highway 101, workplace perks like treadmill workstations and foosball tables, and conference rooms named after celebrities like Rihanna and Justin Bieber. The name of that arriviste company? Walmart. The largest U.S. retailer, which for years did not blink at would-be competitors, is now under such a threat from Amazon that it is frantically playing catch-up by learning the technology business, including starting @WalmartLabs, its dot-com headquarters. The two retail behemoths, one the king of the physical store and the other the conqueror of the online world, are battling over e-commerce \u2014 competing for the most talented engineers, trying to gain the upper hand in the new frontier of same-day delivery and warring over online pricing. They want to control not just Internet shopping but all shopping. Even as Walmart pours money into technology, Amazon is building a physical presence across the nation, adding warehouses and pickup locations. Both companies\u2019 moves indicate that they believe the future of commerce is not just stores and not just online but a combination of the two. For the first time in decades, Walmart, which drove company after company out of business, has a competitor it sounds a little scared of. \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t think for a second that Jeff Bezos is not a capitalist,\u2019\u2019 Neil M. Ashe, chief executive of Walmart Global E-Commerce, said of the belief of Mr. Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, in low prices and paper-thin margins. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re just playing a game, which is, \u2018We\u2019re just going to wait out the world.\u2019\u2019\u2019 Amazon declined to comment. Although the fierce competition between Walmart and Amazon is occurring in all areas, to get the technological edge Walmart has to succeed in San Bruno. The company has had a small presence near Silicon Valley for more than a decade, but until recently, engineers in the area barely knew it existed. It signed a lease three years ago for the San Bruno office, north of the valley \u2014 and across the street from YouTube \u2014 and is opening another this fall in Sunnyvale, home of Yahoo. It is trying hard to prove it is one of the cool kids. For example, at press events in Bentonville, Arkansas, Walmart\u2019s headquarters, the menu tends to be ham sandwiches, chips and iced tea. At a recent event in San Bruno, it was white asparagus panna cotta with house-smoked salmon tartar and charcuterie from a whole pig. Borrowing a page from Google and Twitter, the company offers hack days when engineers can work on whatever they want. The changes are more than cosmetic, though. This year, @WalmartLabs has gone on a start-up shopping spree, buying four companies \u2014 Torbit, OneOps, Tasty Labs and Inkiru \u2014 that build things like tools to crunch data and speed up Web sites. The acquisitions included some of the start-ups\u2019 founders and engineers, the time-honored way for Silicon Valley companies to hire the talented employees they need to build better Web and mobile tools. Walmart has hundreds of open jobs at its office in San Bruno. This summer, the company hired 150 people from companies like Yahoo and eBay. The company\u2019s pitch to engineers is that Walmart moves quickly and has huge problems to solve, even if it is not a nimble newcomer or a buzzworthy start-up. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s big data and there\u2019s Walmart big data,\u2019\u2019 said Ravi Raj, vice president for mobile and social products at @WalmartLabs. \u2018\u2018Every week, we release half a dozen features.\u2019\u2019 Rick Devine, chief executive of TalentSky, a Silicon Valley recruiting firm that has recruited for the company before, said Walmart\u2019s scale was attractive to young engineers. Still, he said, the competition is fierce. \u2018\u2018The kind of people they\u2019re going to be looking for \u2014 big data and e-commerce type of people \u2014 those are the same kinds of people Silicon Valley cares about,\u2019\u2019 he said. Amazon, which is based in Seattle, also has a Silicon Valley presence; its Lab126 research company, located not far from Apple\u2019s headquarters, developed the Kindle and is working on other mobile devices. Amazon is a much bigger player online, with $74.4 billion in revenue expected for 2013. While Walmart\u2019s total revenue is close to $500 billion, it has said it expects just a fraction of that, $10 billion, in e-commerce revenue for the year ending in January. Walmart.com had 62.5 million unique visitors in August, compared with Amazon\u2019s 133 million, according to Compete, which tracks Web use. \u2018\u2018Amazon is the Walmart of the post-2000 period,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Nemer, an analyst at Wells Fargo. Walmart was slow to embrace online shopping, keeping its Web operations separate and haltingly adopting new technology. These days, though, it is trying to turn its 4,100 stores in the United States and many of its 6,200 stores overseas into e-commerce assets. Two-thirds of the U.S. population is within five miles, or eight kilometers, of a Walmart, according to the company, and more than 10 percent of items ordered online are shipped from stores. Countries in which it has a physical presence for e-commerce include Brazil, China and Britain. It is also allowing customers to pick up online orders in stores or, in a test in Washington, in lockers. It is trying same-day delivery in five markets, and grocery delivery in the San Francisco Bay Area and Denver. Executives say Walmart wants to become almost as fast as Amazon, but for people who cannot afford the $79 fee of Amazon\u2019s Prime service, with its free two-day shipping. Amazon has been building warehouses throughout the United States as it tries to expedite its shipping and conquer online grocery delivery. It has had lockers at stores like 7-Eleven for about a year, though in September, RadioShack and Staples stopped participating in the program. Abroad, Amazon has moved even faster with services like same-day delivery and groceries. Following Amazon, Walmart has revamped its online and mobile technology. It has software to watch social media like Pinterest for popular products and to monitor online prices and lower them accordingly or alert merchants. And it has created a mobile app that flips into in-store mode when customers enter a store and guides them to the milk or celery and offers digital coupons; customers can scan items as they shop for quick self-checkout. Analysts say that while Walmart\u2019s scale and profitability give it an edge, its Web efforts still lag behind Amazon\u2019s. The grocery delivery test, for instance, has gone on for two years without expansion. Mr. Nemer of Wells Fargo called many of the efforts, like lockers and same-day shipping, \u2018\u2018blocking and tackling\u2019\u2019 without real relevance to Walmart\u2019s dominance, or inferiority, in the new world of shopping. Mr. Ashe of Walmart said of those efforts, \u2018\u2018The question is whether people want them.\u2019\u2019 Echoing Facebook\u2019s motto on risk taking, \u2018\u2018fail harder,\u2019\u2019 he said: \u2018\u2018We fully expect, and want, to shut things down.\u2019\u2019 And, he said, the culture clash between Bentonville and San Bruno has not been as great as one might expect. \u2018\u2018We are of Walmart and Silicon Valley at the same time,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018So we have a great cafeteria, but we don\u2019t pay for all your food.\u2019\u2019 CORRECTION: As published in the International New York Times An article on Oct. 22 about Walmart\u2019s efforts to catch up in online technology misstated the name of the company\u2019s e-commerce division. It is Walmart Global E-Commerce \u2014 not @WalmartLabs, which is a unit of the e-commerce division. Wednesday, October 30, 2013",

Very few companies have been valued this way outside a systemic bubble.\u201d No one is asserting that Amazon is a flat-out bubble, but there is an increasingly noisy debate about when it will \u2014 or even whether it can \u2014 deliver the sort of bottom-line profits that investors normally demand from a company expected to post $75 billion in revenue this year. The company declined to comment. Some analysts point out that those sales are negligible when set against the market being targeted by Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cThe market is effectively limitless: all of global consumer commerce and maybe business-to-business commerce as well,\u201d said Mr. Janeway, author of \u201cDoing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy.\u201d With that prize as the goal, making money today would be a positive hindrance. As Benedict Evans, an analyst based in London, put it: \u201cBezos has chosen to run Amazon to be the biggest, most powerful and successful retailer on Earth 20 years from now. Any fool could run it profitably today.\u201d A New Book Portrays Amazon as  Bully Jeff Bezos: A Brief  Anthology Tech Sector Responds to Bezos Deal for The  Post Daily Report: Tech Mogul in Deal for a Landmark in the  Capital Daily Report: Google Exceeds Earnings Estimates as Ad Prices Slip",

        "name": "Tech giants jostle for position in the booming market for tablets ",
        "content": " The intense competition will be highlighted on Tuesday, as Apple, Nokia and Microsoft each introduce new tablets. Those devices will be competing for consumer attention against several others recently released by other tech heavyweights, including Amazon, Google and Samsung Electronics. The stakes are high, and getting higher, as demand for tablets has exploded in the past few years. According to Gartner, a market research company, about 120 million tablets were shipped in 2012, nearly seven times as many as in 2010, when the Apple iPad was first released and generated wide interest. \u2018\u2018Getting on an airplane it\u2019s amazing the number of iPads that you now see that used to be either notebooks or portable DVD players,\u2019\u2019 along with smaller tablets and e-book readers that are replacing books and magazines, said Ross Rubin, an independent analyst for Reticle Research. Apple has maintained a clear lead, but with the tablet offerings from manufacturers almost as abundant as those for smartphones, the market has become more fractured. In the second quarter, iPads had the largest share of the worldwide tablet market, with 32 percent, according to the research firm IDC. Samsung, the No. 2 tablet maker, is quickly gaining traction, with 18 percent of the market in the second quarter, up from 7.6 percent in the period a year earlier. Apple is expected to announce significantly upgraded versions of its iPad and iPad Mini devices on Tuesday. The iPad Mini is expected to have a higher-resolution display, while the bigger iPad is expected to have a slimmer design, weighing about a pound. Both iPads will also most likely get Apple\u2019s new processors, but not the fingerprint sensor that is in the latest high-end iPhone. On the same day, Microsoft will release new versions of its Surface tablets, and Nokia, the mobile device maker Microsoft is in the process of buying much of, is expected to introduce a new tablet in Abu Dhabi. Mr. Rubin said each manufacturer had developed slightly different approaches with tablets. Microsoft, for example, is largely going after professionals by offering tablets that double as PCs. Samsung sells a large variety of tablets, some that include a stylus for drawing and taking notes, to cater to different professions and interests. And Apple markets its iPads as versatile devices that can be used for both work and play. Amazon offers low-priced tablets to get people to buy content from its stores \u2014 one of several less expensive tablets that have emerged to challenge the iPad. Amazon\u2019s Kindle Fire costs as little as $140, and Google\u2019s Nexus tablet starts at $230. Apple\u2019s iPad Mini starts at $330. Many new tablets have already failed or struggled. Hewlett-Packard\u2019s TouchPad tablet was killed after 48 days of slow sales. BlackBerry\u2019s PlayBook was a dismal failure. And Microsoft\u2019s first Surface tablets, released last year, sold so poorly that the company took a $900 million write-down for unsold inventory. Some of the tablets may not be catching on because people are not finding them very useful. A Gartner survey found that 80 percent of people with iPads use their tablets at least 10 times a day, much more often than people with other kinds of tablets. That gives iPad owners more time to be exposed to buying more apps, movies and games. And the more apps they buy, the more likely they will keep buying Apple hardware in the future. \u2018\u2018Other tablet providers need to understand why owners of their tablets spent significantly less time on their devices,\u2019\u2019 said Annette Jump, a research director at Gartner. Despite the difficulties of breaking into the market, device makers push hard, knowing that future profits could depend in large part on tablet sales. That is especially true for companies like Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, which have traditionally been closely tied to the PC market. Sales of PCs have softened considerably in recent years, and one reason is that consumers have turned to more mobile tablets for basic computing tasks, like Web surfing and casual game playing. That trend is expected to accelerate. Gartner predicts tablets will outship PCs on an annual basis in two years. About 184 million tablets will be shipped in 2013, Gartner says, versus 303 million PCs. But by 2015, manufacturers will ship 331 million tablets and 272 million PCs. Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, remarked on the rapid growth of the iPad in an earnings call last year. \u2018\u2018Just two years after we shipped the initial iPad, we sold 67 million,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Cook said. \u2018\u2018It took us 24 years to sell that many Macs, and five years for that many iPods, and over three years for that many iPhones.\u2019\u2019 For now, at least, Apple continues to be the standard to beat. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the reference point,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Rubin of Reticle Research. \u2018\u2018It was a pioneer in making tablets more popular and more accessible.\u2019\u2019 Even Apple, though, faces challenges, particularly in emerging markets. In China, for example, generic unbranded tablets that are occasionally fakes sell for as little as $80 and are extremely popular. Yet there is a bright side for Apple in China: The Chinese are buying either the cheap white-box tablets or an iPad, not much in between, according to Carolina Milanesi, a research vice president at Gartner. In such a fast-changing market, however, that could quickly change. What appears certain is that consumers will be hearing much more about tablets this fall, and particularly this week. \u2018\u2018A new iPad launch always piques consumer interest in the tablet category,\u2019\u2019 Tom Mainelli, a research director at IDC, said in a statement. \u2018\u2018And traditionally that has helped both Apple and its competitors.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "Tech Wealth and Ideas Are Heading Into News ",
        "content": " Producing serious news is an expensive enterprise with a beleaguered business model, one that remains tied to the tracks as a locomotive of splintered audiences and declining advertising hurtles toward it. But just when it looked as if all were lost, an unlikely cavalry has come roaring over the hill with serious money, fresh ideas and no small amount of enthusiasm. Silicon Valley and its various power brokers \u2014 some who had roles in putting the news business in harm\u2019s way to begin with \u2014 are suddenly investing significant sums of money in preserving news capacity and quality. Pierre M. Omidyar, the founder of eBay, revealed last week that he  would back   the journalist Glenn Greenwald and his colleagues in a newly conceived news site to the tune of $250 million. Just over two months ago, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, spent  the same amount   to personally buy The Washington Post. That\u2019s half a billion dollars dropped into serious news production, a sector that investors in distressed assets have been fleeing. It doesn\u2019t stop there. In July, Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Steve Jobs, invested in Ozy Media, a news start-up, joining a group that includes the angel investor Ron Conway; Larry Sonsini, a lawyer from an eminent Silicon Valley law firm; Dan Rosensweig of Chegg.com; and David Drummond, Google\u2019s chief legal officer. Chris Hughes used his Facebook money to buy The New Republic and provide financial support to Upworthy, an aggregator of quality material. Next-generation news companies including Vice, Vox Media, BuzzFeed and Business Insider have all recently received significant investment. (In addition, Jeff Skoll, another eBay alum, backed Participant Media and now the TV channel Pivot, to make \u201csocially relevant\u201d films and television.) The list goes on, but the trend is clear: quality news has become, if not sexy, suddenly attractive to smart digital money. It makes sense once you step back. For all its excesses, Silicon Valley has not been a place where ostentation creates social capital. While any tech reporter will tell you that the valley is far from media-friendly, the people in leadership there are close, ferocious consumers of news and have strong opinions about its current shortcomings. And it would be a mistake to view the recent moves by some of the most important people in technology as a lark. \u201cTechnologists have a view, perhaps inflated, that they can make the world better,\u201d Mr. Omidyar said in an interview over the weekend. \u201cThere may be limits to doing it only through technology, or perhaps you get tired of doing it only through technology. So getting into content and broad communication is appealing.\u201d It would also be a mistake to believe that the only thing digitally enriched players bring is money. The investment of intellectual capital will be just as important. If ever an industry was in need of innovation \u2014 of big ideas from uncommon thinkers \u2014 it is the news business. \u201cI think that technology could help find a way to actually do important journalism for our democracy that can impact many more people and help serve it to a general-interest audience in a way that can be commercially sustainable,\u201d Mr. Omidyar said. (More excerpts from the interview with Mr. Omidyar are at  www.nytimes.com/pages/business/media/index.html ). Smaller companies have created news sites that point a way forward but cannot begin to fill the loss of journalistic capacity that accompanied the great shakeout in the industry. For a time, it seemed as if newspapers, where much of journalism\u2019s horsepower is stored, would either be strip-mined or become a plaything. \u201cPeople have been speculating that newspapers would become nothing more than trophies for rich businesspeople at the end of their careers,\u201d said Michael Zimbalist, vice president for research and development at The New York Times. \u201cBut now successful midcareer entrepreneurs are investing and willing to play the long game. They have been disrupters themselves and won\u2019t be bringing the same assumptions to the table.\u201d A profound reset is under way. In more than a decade of covering the news end of the media business, I cannot think of a time of greater optimism or potential. Nontraditional operators like Mr. Bezos can afford to adopt a long-term strategy, something he has done rather effectively at Amazon. And the barriers to entry for ventures like Mr. Omidyar\u2019s start-up have evaporated: cheap digital tools enable production and collaboration, while social media like Twitter and Facebook enable the spread of content through sharing. Technology and journalism, former antagonists, are about to give bromance a try, with Mr. Bezos and Mr. Omidyar leading the way. Both men have upended and reinvented entire legacy categories. EBay created a community out of private buyers and sellers, while Amazon found gold among stacks of books with a seemingly infinite catalog, one-click buying and later, all manner of consumer goods. (Amazon also knows a little about last-mile delivery, so plopping a newspaper on the doorstep never had it so good.) Kenneth Lerer, who is a partner at Lerer Ventures and has backed online sites like BuzzFeed and The Huffington Post, says Mr. Omidyar\u2019s enterprise, which does not even have a name yet, has a leg up. \u201cThe freedom to start a digital concern without legacy baggage is an enormous opportunity, much easier than trying to pivot a traditional news organization,\u201d he said, adding that in both instances digital innovation would be in the front seat. \u201cYou cannot launch a successful modern media company without technology as an equal partner.\u201d It does not take an M.B.A. to understand that the ability to capture consumers\u2019 attention and move them around a platform, all the while extracting value, might come in handy in the media business. ITunes used cheap, uniformly priced content to animate the sales of devices like the iPod; Amazon used cheap devices like the Kindle to push lucrative content sales. EBay reduced the friction and suspicion between buyers and sellers of all kinds of goods. Reverse-engineering those skills into the production of news could have a big impact, as publishing companies turn toward consumers for revenue, pivoting from passive delivery of news to a deeper relationship with customers. The willingness to answer bedeviling old questions in new ways does not ensure success, but it creates remarkable possibilities. \u201cBoth Jeff Bezos and Pierre Omidyar have a hacker\u2019s ethos, a willingness to engage in lateral thinking to solve problems in a nonconventional way, to reject what has been taken for granted and MacGyver their way to solutions,\u201d suggested Shane Snow, a founder of Contently, a marketplace for content creators. Consider Amazon\u2019s ability to lead consumers through a highly personalized array of choices. \u201cIf you have a story that is read by a million people, that\u2019s great, but how do you get those million people to read another story?\u201d said Henry Blodget of Business Insider. \u201cAmazon is extraordinary at customizing its site for every visitor. They do endless testing and understand stickiness and relevance in a way few media companies do.\u201d One of the secrets of Amazon (and Netflix) is that it never offered one site, but millions of customized sites. It is not hard to envision a carefully measured invitation at the bottom of a highly trafficked news article: \u201cPeople who read this story are also reading ...\u201d This unfolding partnership will be fun to behold. For all their differences, the news and technology businesses share a kind of utopianism, an idealistic belief that the work of human hands can make life better for other humans.

        "name": "To Catch Up, Walmart Moves To Amazon Turf ",
        "content": " SAN BRUNO, Calif. -- A plucky Silicon Valley company, forced to compete for talented engineers, is trying it all -- recruiting billboards on Highway 101; workplace perks like treadmill workstations and foosball tables; and conference rooms named after celebrities like Rihanna and Justin Bieber. The name of that arriviste company? Walmart. The country's largest retailer, which for years didn't blink at would-be competitors, is now under such a threat from Amazon that it is frantically playing catch-up by learning the technology business, including starting @WalmartLabs at Walmart Global E-Commerce, its dot-com division. The two retail behemoths, one the king of the physical store and the other the conqueror of the online world, are battling over e-commerce -- competing for the most talented engineers, trying to gain the upper hand in the new frontier of same-day delivery and warring over online pricing. They want to control not just Internet shopping but all shopping. Even as Walmart pours money into technology, Amazon is building a physical presence across the nation, adding warehouses and pickup locations. Both companies' moves indicate that they believe the future of commerce is not just stores and not just online but a combination of the two. For the first time in decades, Walmart, which drove company after company out of business, has a competitor it sounds a little scared of. ''Don't think for a second that Jeff Bezos is not a capitalist,'' Neil M. Ashe, chief executive of Walmart Global E-Commerce, said of the belief of Mr. Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, in low prices and paper-thin margins. ''They're just playing a game, which is, 'We're just going to wait out the world.' '' Amazon declined to comment. Although the fierce competition between Walmart and Amazon is occurring in all areas, to get the technological edge Walmart has to succeed in San Bruno. The company has had a small presence near Silicon Valley for more than a decade, but until recently, engineers in the area barely knew it existed. It signed a lease three years ago for the San Bruno office, north of the valley -- and across the street from YouTube -- and is opening another this fall in Sunnyvale, home of Yahoo, in the heart of the valley. It is trying hard to prove it is one of the cool kids. For example, at press events in Bentonville, Ark., Walmart's headquarters, the menu tends to be ham sandwiches, chips and iced tea. At a recent event in San Bruno, it was white asparagus panna cotta with house-smoked salmon tartar, morel mushroom macaroons and charcuterie from a whole pig. Borrowing a page from Google and Twitter, the company offers hack days when engineers can work on whatever they want. The changes are more than cosmetic, though. This year, @WalmartLabs has gone on a start-up shopping spree, buying four companies -- Torbit, OneOps, Tasty Labs and Inkiru -- that build things like tools to crunch data and speed up Web sites. The acquisitions included some of the start-ups' founders and engineers, the time-honored way for Silicon Valley companies to hire the talented employees they need to build better Web and mobile tools. Walmart has hundreds of open jobs at its office here. This summer, the company hired 150 people from companies like Yahoo and eBay. The company's pitch to engineers is that Walmart moves quickly and has huge problems to solve, even if it is not a nimble newcomer or a buzzworthy start-up. ''There's big data and there's Walmart big data,'' said Ravi Raj, vice president for mobile and social products at @WalmartLabs. ''Every week we release half a dozen features.'' Rick Devine, chief executive of TalentSky, a Silicon Valley recruiting firm that has recruited for the company before, said Walmart's scale was attractive to young engineers. Still, he said, the competition is fierce. ''The kind of people they're going to be looking for -- big data and e-commerce type of people -- those are the same kinds of people Silicon Valley cares about,'' he said. Amazon, which is based in Seattle, also has a Silicon Valley presence; its Lab126 research company, located a few miles from Apple's headquarters, developed the Kindle and is working on other mobile devices. Amazon is a much bigger player online, with $74.4 billion in revenue expected for 2013. While Walmart's total revenue is close to $500 billion, it has said it expects just a fraction of that, $10 billion, in e-commerce revenue for the year ending January 2014. Walmart.com had 62.5 million unique visitors in August, compared with Amazon's 133 million, according to Compete, which tracks Web use. ''Amazon is the Walmart of the post-2000 period,'' said Matt Nemer, an analyst at Wells Fargo. Walmart was slow to embrace online shopping, keeping its Web operations separate and haltingly adopting new technology. These days, though, it is trying to turn its 4,100 stores in the United States and many of its 6,200 stores overseas into e-commerce assets. Two-thirds of the United States population is within five miles of a Walmart, according to the company, and more than 10 percent of items ordered online are shipped from stores. Countries in which it has a physical presence for e-commerce include Brazil, China and Britain. It is also allowing customers to pick up online orders in stores or, in a test in Washington, in lockers. It is trying same-day delivery in five markets, and grocery delivery in the Bay Area and Denver. Executives say Walmart wants to become almost as fast as Amazon, but for people who can't afford the $79 fee of Amazon's Prime service, with its free two-day shipping. Amazon has been building warehouses throughout the United States as it tries to expedite its shipping and conquer online grocery delivery. It has had lockers at stores like 7-Eleven for about a year, though in September, RadioShack and Staples stopped participating in the program. Abroad, Amazon has moved even faster with services like same-day delivery and groceries. Following Amazon, Walmart has revamped its online and mobile technology. It has software to watch social media like Pinterest for popular products and to monitor online prices and lower them accordingly or alert merchants. And it has created a mobile app that flips into in-store mode when customers enter a store and guides them to the milk or celery and offers digital coupons; customers can scan items as they shop for quick self-checkout. Analysts say that while Walmart's scale and profitability give it an edge, its Web efforts still lag Amazon's. The grocery delivery test, for instance, has gone on for two years without expansion. Mr. Nemer of Wells Fargo called many of the efforts, like lockers and same-day shipping, ''blocking and tackling'' without real relevance to Walmart's dominance, or inferiority, in the new world of shopping. Mr. Ashe of Walmart said of those efforts, ''The question is whether people want them.'' Echoing Facebook's motto on risk taking, ''fail harder,'' he said: ''We fully expect, and want, to shut things down.'' And, he said, the culture clash between Bentonville and San Bruno has not been as great as one might expect. ''We are of Walmart and Silicon Valley at the same time,'' he said. ''So we have a great cafeteria, but we don't pay for all your food.'' Neil M. Ashe of Walmart Global E-Commerce at the company's dot-com headquarters, @WalmartLabs, in San Bruno, Calif.

G.E. also announced partnerships with Cisco, AT&T and Intel as part of Wednesday\u2019s announcement. The company already has engagements with Accenture, and Amazon.com\u2019s big cloud-computing service. It is also an investor in   Pivotal , a company building Industrial Internet applications. In July, I.B.M. announced it would collaborate with Pivotal. The products that G.E. announced Wednesday, which work with a data management system it calls Predix, are in aviation, power and water, transportation, oil and gas, health care, and energy management. Mr. Ruh said that one product, designed to maximize a jet\u2019s fuel burn while monitoring carbon emissions, would save an airline $90 million over five years. A power generation product designed to optimize turbine usage was expected to increase one utility\u2019s profits by $28 million, while creating lower emissions per megawatt. The push into the Industrial Internet is likely to have profound changes for G.E. as well. Mr. Ruh, who heads a 300-person Bay Area office, said G.E. is adopting practices like releasing stripped-down products quickly, monitoring usage and rapidly changing designs depending on how things are used by customers. These approaches follow the \u201clean start-up\u201d style at many software-intensive Internet companies. \u201cWe\u2019re getting these offerings done in three, six, nine months,\u201d he said. \u201cIt used to take three years.\u201d Mark Little, G.E.\u2019s chief technology officer, has also said that the Industrial Internet could revive G.E.\u2019s manufacturing business in the United States, though not in ways traditional manufacturers would recognize. Since G.E. wants to understand how machines behave in the field, it also needs to have its sensors on them from the earliest part of their creation. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent most of my career trying to offload manufacturing,\u201d Mr. Little said in an interview in June. \u201cNow we\u2019re talking about vertical integration again.\u201d Much of the manufacturing, however, will be done by robots, he said. G.E. may be anticipating some criticism if it does move factories from China to the United States but doesn\u2019t put many humans in them. On Tuesday, the company published   a paper  saying that massive automation of factories would not mean a net job loss. Instead, it said, workers would be retrained to be more productive by interacting with the machines. It was not clear how or why this retraining, or the expansion of United States manufacturing using robots, would require nearly the same number of workers. \u201cNo one is talking about a refreshing of the tradition of manufacturing onshore,\u201d Mr. Ruh said. \u201cThe scope and kinds of jobs will change, and they will require lots more math and science skills.\u201d The Cloud Era Begins for Enterprise  Tech Daily Report: As Tech Industry Shifts, Big Players Scramble to  Adapt General Electric Adds to Its \u2018Industrial  Internet\u2019 For 2010, IDC Predicts an Apple iPad and Battles in the  Cloud Daily Report: Europe Weighs Regulations for Cloud  Computing Eric Anderson, an engineer at a turbine factory run by General Electric, which has been one of the biggest promoters of the so-called Industrial Internet. | Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times | Eric Anderson, an engineer at a turbine factory run by General Electric, which has been one of the biggest promoters of the",

        "content": " PARIS \u2014 French lawmakers on Thursday took aim at Amazon to protect local bookshops by voting through a law that bars online booksellers from offering free delivery to customers on top of a maximum 5 percent discount on books. The law is part of France\u2019s broader regulation of book prices and curbs on discounting, which was passed in 1981 by the Socialist government at the time to protect small bookshops from supermarket chains. In the past decade, online outlets have challenged physical bookstores, prompting French publishers to lobby for a change in the law to stop what they call Amazon\u2019s \u201cdumping\u201d and \u201cunfair competition\u201d. According to a French parliamentary report, online book sales rose to 13.1 percent of total book sales in 2011 from 3.2 percent in 2003. The country is still home to more bookstores than most countries with 2,000-2,500 in a country of 65 million people, compared with 1,000 in Britain, which has roughly the same-sized population. \u201cThe (book pricing) law is part of our cultural heritage,\u201d said conservative lawmaker Christian Kert who sponsored the bill. France\u2019s lower chamber, with the support of the Socialist government, passed the law unanimously. It will now go to the Senate, which is expected to pass it by the end of the year. For its part, Amazon said the law would have the perverse effect of hurting sales of books from the back catalogue and from smaller publishing houses, which were often bought online. \u201cAll measures that aim to raise the price of books sold online will curb the ability of French people to buy cultural works and discriminates against those who buy online,\u201d it said. The proposed law is only the latest example of France taking aim at U.S.-based Internet giants. Last week the country\u2019s data protection watchdog moved closer to fining Google for the way it stores and tracks user information after the search engine ignored a three-month ultimatum to bring its practices in line with local law. France has called on the European Union to regulate global Internet companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook more aggressively, to counter their growing dominance of online commerce and services. It is pushing within the OECD and G20 organisations to tighten tax rules to make sure that Internet companies cannot avoid tax by locating their headquarters in low-cost EU countries. Amazon and Google are subject of ongoing tax audits in France.",

        "content": " If it\u2019s October, that must mean the holiday buying season has begun \u2014 and that means Amazon will offer a new color tablet. It\u2019s the Kindle Fire HDX. The 7-inch, or 18-centimeter, model costs $230, and it\u2019s terrific. A 9-inch sibling is $380. The battery goes for about 11 hours, or 17 hours in a power-saving, reading-only mode. The stereo speakers sound great. The plastic case weighs less than the prior version and has narrower margins around the screen. There\u2019s a mediocre camera on the front for video chatting and, on the 9-inch, or 23 centimeter, model, also an 8-megapixel camera for taking pictures. The one big misfire was putting the power and volume keys on the back; you\u2019ll spend the first week hitting the \u2018\u2018off\u2019\u2019 button by mistake while trying to turn up the sound. The X in HDX refers to the screen\u2019s clarity. It packs in 323 tiny dots per inch, making it sharper than high definition, and making the iPad Mini\u2019s 163 dots per inch look coarse. The HDX\u2019s screen really is spectacular, if infuriatingly reflective. The trouble is, you can see the new sharpness only when you\u2019re looking at source material with resolution that high. The type in books and magazines looks razor-sharp, but most of the 150,000 television shows and videos in Amazon\u2019s catalog don\u2019t look any clearer. Movies are also the wrong shape for the screen; you see black bands above and below. Although the Kindle is based on the Android operating system, Amazon has thoroughly disguised it. The home screen still features a sliding horizontal \u2018\u2018carousel\u2019\u2019 of everything you\u2019ve had open recently \u2014 books, movies, music, apps. Below that carousel, you now see a traditional grid of icons, just as on other tablets. Good. Parental controls are easy and effective. You can limit your kids\u2019 time each day or limit which items they can use, watch or read. Amazon has started to bring its X-ray trivia feature to movies and music. Some of the songs you buy from Amazon (a few thousand, apparently) now display scrolling lyrics. And watching a movie with the X-ray panel open is great fun in that it identifies the actors in the scene before you, offers their bios in one tap, and tells you the name of the song playing in the background. The company says that in an upcoming software update, you\u2019ll be able to fling the video to a PlayStation 3 or a Samsung TV, while continuing to read the X-ray details on your Kindle Fire. That doesn\u2019t fully compensate, however, for the loss of any other way to connect the Fire to a TV: the HDMI jack is gone. Boldest and most stunning of all, though, is \u2018\u2018Mayday\u2019\u2019: a button that places an instant, free video call to a 24-hour help technician. The agents can see your screen, but can\u2019t see you. You can see the agents (in a tiny, 1-inch movable window), and accept their invitation to take control of your Kindle or draw with virtual highlighters around elements of the screen. Mayday is amazing and truly practical, but keep in mind that the HDX won\u2019t be for sale until later this month. Will there be enough of those video agents to go around, especially Christmas week? Now, $230 is an excellent price for a tablet this fast, smooth and satisfying \u2014 and this Amazon tablet finally includes a wall charger. It\u2019s $30 more than last year\u2019s model, but bargain hunters might be happy with the revamped Kindle Fire HD, which is only $140 despite being, as a rep told me, \u2018\u2018more performant.\u2019\u2019 I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s supposed to mean \u2018\u2018faster.\u2019\u2019 But $230 also happens to be the price of Google\u2019s Nexus 7 tablet, which is also fast, smooth and satisfying, and also has a 323-dots-per-inch screen. On the Kindle, though, you see a full-screen ad every time you turn on the device; getting rid of them forever costs another $15. For another $50, you can buy a cover that attaches magnetically and folds in weird ways to act as a stand. So which is the better deal? Depends on what you\u2019re looking for. The Nexus is a real tablet, with all of the flexibility and complexity that entails. The Kindle Fire is still clearly intended to show off the books, TV shows, music and videos you\u2019ve bought from Amazon. It still doesn\u2019t seem like a \u2018\u2018real\u2019\u2019 tablet. There\u2019s still no GPS navigation, no speech recognition, no to-do list or notes app. It doesn\u2019t run standard Android apps, and can\u2019t access the Google Play store that houses a million of them. About 100,000 apps have been tailored for the Fire, but lots of important ones are missing \u2014 including Dropbox, SkyDrive and anything by Google. That\u2019s not a slam, either. The Kindle\u2019s simplicity and dedication to its purpose has always been its primary virtue. Amazon should tread carefully; piling on features risks junking up this focused, efficient reader. Already, the company intends to add \u2018\u2018enterprise\u2019\u2019 features in a software update this autumn: VPN access, Office-compatible productivity suite, hardware data encryption and so on.",

        "content": " While researching  my article on Amazon Art , Amazon\u2019s new fine-art and collectibles site, I made a couple of test purchases. Because my budget was tight, I limited my browsing to the site\u2019s two lowest price tiers \u2014 \u201cunder $99,\u201d and \u201c$100 to $250.\u201d Anyone who has shopped for shoes or kitchen appliances on Amazon will recognize the format. On the left side of the Web page, a vertical list of categories helps narrow the search. These include medium (paintings or prints, for example), subject (abstract, still life, animals), style, price, color and gallery. Clicking on a gallery name summons up works by the artists offered by that gallery. Click on a specific work, and you get details about size and medium, a short biographical sketch of the artists, and, lower down on the page, a horizontal lineup of the artist\u2019s other works for sale on Amazon Art. A zoom feature allows you to inspect areas of interest close up. Clicking on the \u201cIn Room\u201d feature puts the work on the wall of a sparsely furnished room, allowing you to get a sense of scale. My first work, for $150, was a large reproduction Audubon print of a dusky albatross from the Amsterdam facsimile edition of \u201cThe Birds of America.\u201d The second,  \u201cI Get High With a Liitle Help From Vermeer,\u201d   was a signed $50 print by David MacDowell, described on the site as a satirist who \u201cvalidates the abused underbelly of society with X-ray glasses.\u201d The print showed a petulant-looking Ringo Starr in the turban-like headdress worn by the sitter in Vermeer\u2019s \u201cGirl With a Pearl Earring.\u201d The \u201cliitle\u201d in the title is apparently meant to suggest Dutch. Both prints were unframed. I entered my address and credit-card information, chose standard shipping from the usual list of three options, and clicked to purchase. Shipping and handling was free for the Audubon, $15 for the MacDowell. I finalized the transaction at 9:01 a.m. Donald Heald Rare Books, Prints and Maps, in Manhattan, sent me an e-mail 45 minutes later telling me that my print had shipped. It arrived the next morning in a sturdy cardboard mailing tube via UPS. Dirty Pilot, in Cochituate, Mass., shipped the MacDowell two days after purchase. It arrived the following day in the mail in a flat package fashioned from a mailing box. Both works were undamaged. The Ringo Starr print, signed by the artist and embossed with the gallery\u2019s seal, was numbered 52 in an edition of 90. A tasty-looking lithograph of cakes and pies by Wayne Thiebaud caught my eye. The price is $16,000, plus $550 shipping. It\u2019s just a click away.
