        "content": " Updated to add comment from Amazon. In the dark of night, very late on Tuesday, Amazon.com announced   a refresh of its Kindle Fire tablet line: lighter, faster, cheaper. The Fires were introduced two years ago, and this is their second update in a tablet environment that is brutally competitive. Microsoft, for instance,  announced   the new generation of its struggling Surface tablets earlier this week. And the devices are getting more proprietary. Tesco, a supermarket chain in Britain,  introduced  a tablet this week for its customers. Amazon said the Kindle Fire HDX, at 8.9 inches, would be 34 percent lighter than the previous model. It would have a faster memory and a faster processor, and 11 hours of battery time for mixed use. If you did nothing but read, it would be 17 hours. In its announcement , Amazon trumpeted the Fire\u2019s new \u201cMayday\u201d button, which it will be promoted in television commercials. Tap the button and you will be connected to an Amazon expert \u201c24\u00d77, 365 days a year.\u201d Which brings up the question: Why is this feature needed? Were the previous Fires so complicated that they confused customers? The Amazon public relations team was not as voluble as the Mayday squad, and no answer was forthcoming Tuesday night. (An Amazon spokeswoman later said that earlier Fires did not confuse customers.) The cheapest Fire will sell for $139, a substantial discount from the previous version. But it is hard to tell how the Fire is doing because Amazon does not release sales figures. This is clear: It is very far behind the iPad. Apple sold about $33 billion worth of iPads in the last year. Amazon\u2019s total revenue in 2012 was less than twice that, and Amazon sells many, many other things besides Kindles. \u201cThe challenge for Amazon is expanding its appeal beyond Amazon\u2019s super fans,\u201d said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forester analyst. \u201cThey\u2019re not the market leader, or anywhere near it. The risk is they fall by the wayside like Barnes & Noble \u2014 max out their base and then have nowhere to go.\u201d Next up, according to the rumors: Kindle TV, a set-top device that will feed Amazon\u2019s growing selection of video content directly into living rooms.

        "name": "Joy Covey, Top Executive in Amazon.com\u2019s Early Days, Dies at 50 ",
        "content": " Joy Covey, an executive who joined Amazon.com when it was a new company with big ideas and played a major role in turning those ideas into reality, died on Wednesday after the bicycle she was riding struck a delivery van in a remote stretch of San Mateo County, Calif. She was 50. The police said that a minivan apparently making deliveries for OnTrac, a shipping service used by Amazon and other online retailers, was turning onto a side road when the accident occurred along Skyline Boulevard. Ms. Covey was pronounced dead at the scene. The van driver was not charged. As Amazon\u2019s first chief financial officer, Ms. Covey helped take the company public and was an independent-minded advocate for Amazon\u2019s plans to ignore Wall Street and invest for the future. That notion, radical in its day, was the foundation for Amazon\u2019s growth into a $61 billion retailing and entertainment behemoth. In its early days, Amazon prided itself on its unconventional hires, telling staffing agencies to \u201csend us your freaks.\u201d Ms. Covey did not have a traditional background. She dropped out of high school at 15 and worked as a grocery clerk. She attended Cal State Fresno and later Harvard Law School, where, she said, she did not fit in. \u201cWe\u2019d go to lunch and people would talk about their favorite 17th-century poets, and I\u2019d be thinking, \u2018Could I even name five poets?  From any century?\u2019 \u201c But after joining Amazon in late 1996, when its annual revenue was less than $20 million, she thrived. She sold Wall Street the debt that the company needed to expand. The company went public on May 14, 1997, with an initial offering price of $18. Shares this week were selling for more than $312. Her own wealth is estimated at more than $200 million. Joy Dianne Covey was born on April 25, 1963, in Boston, to Maurice C. Covey, a physician, and the former Joan De Vries, a nurse. She grew up in San Mateo and lived in Woodside, Calif. As the senior woman in a red-hot Internet company, Ms. Covey drew a great deal of attention, including a profile in Forbes magazine headlined \u201cA Real Amazon.\u201d She left Amazon in 2000, as the dot-com boom was ending. Survivors include a young son, Tyler.

        "name": "Amazon to Pair Print and E-Books ",
        "content": " For most readers, print and electronic books are an either-or proposition. There just isn't a compelling reason to buy both editions of one book, at least not at full price. Amazon is about to test how much appetite there is for combined print-and-digital book purchases if it cuts the price of Kindle books to less than that of a Starbucks latte. On Tuesday, the company plans to announce a new program, Kindle MatchBook, that lets its customers buy the electronic versions of books they have already purchased in print form for either $2.99, $1.99, $0.99 or free. That's far less than the $11 or more that Amazon typically charges for standalone purchases of the latest Kindle titles. One benefit of MatchBook is that Amazon will let its customers buy Kindle editions of books that they purchased in print as far back as 1995, the year Amazon opened for business. The discounted Kindle edition prices apply to book purchases made in the future on Amazon too. In an interview, Russ Grandinetti, vice president of Kindle Content, said one of the most common requests Amazon receives from its Kindle customers is a way to build parallel print and digital book libraries, which hasn't been practical at full retail prices. He said many print lovers will enjoy Kindle features like text searching of books, especially reference books. Kindle fans, meanwhile, still want print editions of books as souvenirs and art objects. ''A lot of people are really attached to the idea of sticking books on a shelf,'' Mr. Grandinetti said. There's little doubt some book fans exist who are as enthusiastic about the benefits of e-books as they are wistful for the sight of colorful book spines on their walls. The question is how many of them there are. The success of the program will be determined partly by whether book publishers embrace it. So far, Amazon has agreements from only a couple of major publishers -- HarperCollins was the only one Mr. Grandinetti was willing to name -- to offer their titles through MatchBook. He said Amazon hadn't told most publishers about MatchBook yet and hoped to sign more up to join the program, which will begin in October. He predicted there will be more than 10,000 books available for purchase through MatchBook, including ''A Prayer for Owen Meany'' by John Irving, ''I Know This Much is True'' by Wally Lamb and ''The Thorn Birds'' by Colleen McCullough. Although publishers have shown discomfort with Amazon's outsize clout in book retailing, Mr. Grandinetti said he doesn't expect a lot of resistance, because MatchBook represents an ''incremental revenue stream for publishers and authors.'' Even if Amazon gets widespread buy-in from publishers, it isn't clear whether a discounted combined price will be compelling. In some cases, the price for Kindle editions of older books is already very low (the Kindle version of ''A Prayer for Owen Meany'' is $2.99, for example). MatchBook will make little difference to a print buyer of that book unless Amazon drops the Kindle price to almost nothing. For the latest bestsellers like Sheryl Sandberg's ''Lean In,'' the value could look better. Amazon currently sells the print and Kindle editions for standalone prices of $12.81 and $10.99, respectively. Assuming that Ms. Sandberg's book becomes available through MatchBook and that Amazon doesn't jack up the print price of the book, an e-book and print package for ''Lean In'' would cost $15.80 or less. Does the nostalgia for print run deep enough among Kindle users to justify the extra price, though, and is there really much hunger for digital editions of long-ago print purchases? Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, is fiendishly good at selling people things they didn't necessarily know they needed. If he can't sell two books for the price of a bit-more-than-one, then it's unlikely anyone can.",

        "content": " Let\u2019s say it: Last summer was the beginning of the end for the old guard in what is still the biggest part of technology \u2013 business spending on everything from servers to software. This fall begins a new competition for the hearts and minds of corporate customers. Consider a few of summer\u2019s events.  Dell   started to go private in the face of eroding personal computer demand. Hewlett-Packard once again  announced   lower revenue, and had more executive reshuffles. Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer,  resigned , then in the last big weekend of summer  bought   the handset business of a deeply weakened Nokia. That last step, an effort to build up mobility, is at the heart of Microsoft\u2019s efforts to be relevant in a new world of cloud computing, smartphones and tablets. So was VMware\u2019s  announcement   that it is building out its cloud business and changing its sales strategy globally. With autumn, we begin the new round of tech announcements, the way Detroit used to announce next year\u2019s car models. What you should look for is how the old guard adapts to the cloud, and how the new guys aim to consolidate disparate offerings and win trust. The world now passing away consisted of business systems dominated by computer servers and personal computers. The new one subsumes these into cloud computing and devices like smartphones and tablets. The inability of companies like Microsoft and Dell to cope quickly enough with this change led to their current problems. The steady, thorough way that companies like Amazon and Salesforce have used the new technology to go after their elders\u2019 business is what makes them contenders. Other challengers include Google, Workday and NetSuite. There are many more, but these companies in particular have both the assets and the money to build comprehensive offerings in software and services, and also to afford something like service guarantees in what many see as a still-unstable and security-challenged world. One way to do that is to become the unifying agent for all the data that companies are spreading across their servers and cloud services. On Friday, Salesforce announced  Salesforce Files , which searches through things companies have stored in Sharepoint, Dropbox, Google Drive and other storage and collaboration services. \u201cThe way to remove friction among all these repositories is to virtualize everything into a common repository,\u201d said Nasi Jazayeri, general manager of Salesforce Chatter, the company\u2019s corporate collaboration product. He added, \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to compete with the other repositories \u2013 we\u2019re trying to make it easier for people to find things.\u201d Salesforce wasn\u2019t trying to compete with the repositories because Chatterbox, its effort to do so, was a dud. But if Salesforce becomes a central hub for sorting diverse information, that loss can be a win. Workday, which has announced that it is putting data-analysis services in its cloud-based human resources and financial software, may be making a similar move to consolidate information for customers. \u201cBig data analytics is unifying,\u201d said Dan Beck, Workday\u2019s vice president of financials and analytics, since it may draw from information in, say, a Workday database and an SAP or Twitter database. \u201cWe\u2019re broadening out our applications footprint. Customers expect that.\u201d In the past several months, Amazon has introduced a \u201c trusted advisor \u201d program that inspects a company\u2019s use of Amazon Web Services, its cloud service, and suggests ways it can be better used. It has had a global series of \u201csummits\u201d aimed at ordinary business people along with skilled technologists, and  built out   a lot of big data offerings. Google has also expanded its corporate cloud strategy,  enlisting   more developers and guaranteeing higher performance for its cloud. It is also selling new and different ways people can use Google for big data analysis. Big data is being sold as a way to build efficiency and gain insights. But for many of these companies, offering big data services is also a way to consolidate data for customers. If you control information, you are almost by default the trusted partner, or what is known in the business as \u201cthe single throat to choke if something goes wrong.\u201d Jobs like that pay a premium. Some of these older enterprise tech companies, which also include Cisco and Oracle, will make the transition, just as incumbents like I.B.M. made it from mainframe computers to servers and PC\u2019s. Oracle\u2019s approach is to offer a complete system, making it a single throat to choke. I.B.M. already seems to be working both camps in the new world, offering its own systems and consulting with the new players. But just as surely as all of them, in their time, supplanted big incumbents, there will be other companies coming along to topple them.

        "name": "Amazon founder impresses Washington Post\u2019s news staff ",
        "content": " Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon.com\u2019s founder and the prospective new owner of The Washington Post, has assured newsroom employees that he is committed to preserving quality journalism, investing in news and making sure The Post adheres to his underlying philosophy about content: \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t be boring.\u2019\u2019 Over the course of the day on Wednesday, he gave some indication of the kind of journalism that interested him, answered questions about The Post\u2019s coverage of Amazon and did not disguise his interest at the intersection of his businesses, telling an afternoon meeting that \u2018\u2018it should be as easy to get a subscription to The Post as it is to buy diapers on Amazon,\u2019\u2019 according to one employee who attended the meeting. The two-day visit was Mr. Bezos\u2019 first trip to The Post since he agreed to buy the paper in early August for $250 million. With the deal set to close in October, Mr. Bezos made the visit to chat with employees from both the business and editorial sides about his plans for the company. By the end of his visit late Wednesday, Mr. Bezos seemed to have won over employees, who posted photographs of him, speculated on how many electronic devices he had in his pockets, liberally quoted his thoughts on the news business on social media and gave him the hashtag #bezospalooza. \u2018\u2018He charmed the room of 20 hard-bitten journalists,\u2019\u2019 said Jeff Leen, The Post\u2019s investigations editor, who attended a lunch meeting with Mr. Bezos. \u2018\u2018He was a big supporter of investigative reporting, which warmed my heart. He already has a very good grasp of our business. It was, all in all, a very impressive performance.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos started Wednesday with an hourlong breakfast with Bob Woodward. Mr. Woodward, the longtime Post writer who gained prominence through his reporting with Carl Bernstein on the Watergate scandal in the Nixon administration, said in an e-mail after the meeting that through the breakfast, \u2018\u2018Jeff Bezos explained the thinking behind his reasoned and careful step-by-step process in deciding to buy The Post.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Woodward added: \u2018\u2018I was struck by how wide-ranging and methodical he is. He voiced strong, even intense, optimism about the future of The Post, and I suspect he will be calling on everyone here to pitch in with extra amounts of energy, focus and creativity.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos then met for a little more than an hour for coffee with about 20 reporters and talked about how he defined success. \u2018\u2018What\u2019s been happening over the last several years can\u2019t continue to happen,\u2019\u2019 he said. Mr. Bezos told reporters that the paper should focus on delivering important, compelling stories to its readers. If it does that, advertisers will come, he said. Several reporters said that message had left them feeling upbeat, convinced that Mr. Bezos was committed to high-quality journalism. \u2018\u2018You got the feeling that he is not here to just take the Washington Post brand name and turn it into something else,\u2019\u2019 said one reporter who attended and who spoke anonymously. \u2018\u2018This is not somebody who is in a panic trying to make a profit for next year. He wants to solve it in a way that will endure for decades.\u2019\u2019 For lunch, Mr. Bezos met with senior editors. He mentioned that some of The Post\u2019s recent coverage that he had found especially intriguing included \u2018\u20189 Questions about Syria you were too embarrassed to ask\u2019\u2019 and the obituary of a bouncer at the 9:30 Club, a well-known Washington nightspot. In the late afternoon, Mr. Bezos met with the entire newsroom for a question-and-answer session that lasted more than an hour. That was the most widely chronicled event, with employees posting Twitter messages and comments \u2014 or what they called \u2018\u2018Bezosisms\u2019\u2019 \u2014 every few minutes. Mr. Bezos answered questions about why he had decided to buy The Post and why he would be interested in buying a newspaper when Amazon had a reputation for being slow to answer reporters\u2019 questions. Erik Wemple, The Post\u2019s media reporter, quoted Mr. Bezos on Twitter as saying, \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve always felt that the most powerful minds in the world can hold powerful inconsistencies.\u2019\u2019 Toward the end of the session, Mr. Bezos addressed more difficult questions, like the possible conflict of interest between Amazon\u2019s contract for computer work with the C.I.A. and The Post\u2019s coverage of the agency. One employee, who attended the session but did not feel comfortable speaking on the record about the paper\u2019s future owner, said that while Mr. Bezos \u2018\u2018danced around\u2019\u2019 his answer, he added that he expected The Post to cover the relationship aggressively. Mr. Bezos may have offered his most reassuring comments when asked about his thoughts on journalism\u2019s future. In a post, Cara Ann Kelly, The Post\u2019s Style Web producer, quoted him as saying, \u2018\u2018If it\u2019s hopeless \u2014 I would feel sorry for you guys \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t want to join you.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "Julie Gilhart: Bouncing Back With a Digital Twist ",
        "content": " \u201cI\u2019m in a completely virtual space,\u201d Julie Gilhart said recently. On the eve of her umpteenth Fashion Week, the former fashion director of Barneys, now a fashion consultant whose biggest client is Amazon, was reflecting on how much the pace of shopping has accelerated since her 18 years at the department store. \"It\u2019s \u2019global\u2019 at your fingertips, 24-7,\u201d she said. \u201cIt puts tremendous pressure on everyone from retailers to designers and everyone in between.\u201d Ms. Gilhart is 55, but she has plunged into the churning waters of e-commerce with a millennial\u2019s enthusiasm, bringing her famous eye for brands to the Amazon platforms Shopbop, MyHabit and Amazon Fashion and advising the company on the 40,000-square-foot photography studio it opened in Williamsburg last month. (She has leased a personal office in NeueHouse, the Gramercy private work-space collective.) \u201cObviously I didn\u2019t plan this, but with the Internet it\u2019s like I leapfrogged,\u201d Ms. Gilhart said, praising the transparency of the online environment in the way it allows retailers to track customer preferences, among other data. But, she said, \u201cfashion can\u2019t be just a technology equation, It is filled with instinct, emotion and an eye into the future.\u201d Ms. Gilhart herself has run the full gamut of emotions during her time in the industry, including shock when she was fired by Barneys\u2019 current chief executive, Mark Lee, as part of a management shake-up in 2010. \u201cI was like, What? Come again?\u201d Ms. Gilhart recalled of getting the news in his office. \u201cI remember, in slow motion, putting my coat back on. After that, it was just sort of a haze.\u201d Sporting a deep tan from a Costa Rica surfing trip, the tall Ms. Gilhart, a Texan, seems to have found clarity in a flexible role that allows her to devote more time to pet causes like ecologically conscious clothes. (Eventually, she said, customers \u201cwill not just be seduced by the \u2018fashion\u2019 but also by how the fashion is made.\u201d) But it was difficult going for a while. Ms. Gilhart\u2019s dog died and then she injured a disk in her back. Her longtime Barneys crew, which was \u201clike family,\u201d she said, had splintered (Judy Collinson, the executive vice president and a close friend, was also let go). And without the powerful establishment behind her, she said, \u201cevery relationship in my life changed.\u201d One that got better was with Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor. Ms. Gilhart said Ms. Wintour had never been \u201cparticularly close\u201d before the bad news but was the first to call after she was let go. \u201cShe said, \u2018It\u2019s going to be fine, these things happen,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Gilhart, who would go on to broker Amazon\u2019s sponsorship of the Costume Institute gala in 2012. \u201cShe had me immediately talking to people. She was like my fashion fairy godmother.\u201d In an e-mail message, Ms. Wintour wrote of Ms. Gilhart: \u201cShe has always been a fearless yet kind advocate for young designers in this country and beyond.\u201d Indeed, at the CFDA Awards in June, there was Ms. Gilhart, with her characteristic prescience, wearing a cutout frock by Suno, which that night won the Swarovksi Award for women\u2019s wear. \u201cShe\u2019s awesome \u2014 this cool, creative spirit in how she sees things,\u201d said the line\u2019s designer, Erin Beatty, before collecting the trophy. Ms. Gilhart started in the business in 1979, with a summer job after her junior year at the University of Texas, in the epicure department of the then-new Neiman Marcus in Dallas. \u201cThat was when Cuisinart first came out,\u201d Ms. Gilhart said. \u201cI cleaned up that summer.\u201d As a top saleswoman at the store, she was soon promoted to designer clothing. \u201cI was so over college,\u201d she said. She never graduated, getting an unofficial degree in 1980s fashion. (\u201cPerry Ellis, Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren,\u201d she said reverently). When a position as assistant to the well-respected buyer Benita Downing opened up, she pounced. \u201cShe had traveled with Stanley Marcus,\u201d Ms. Gilhart said. \u201cShe discovered the Missonis, discovered Ungaro. Karl Lagerfeld would write her birthday cards.\u201d Ms. Downing took Ms. Gilhart to Europe for the collections and refined her eye. \u201cLooking back, I think she\u2019s the one who taught me how to nurture talent,\u201d Ms. Gilhart said. After two years, she was promoted to buyer in European knitwear, which included then up-and-comers like Azzedine Ala\u00efa and Issey Miyake. \u201cI was so unprepared,\u201d she said. \u201cI was saved in some way because business was booming.\u201d The late \u201980s and early \u201990s were all about runway extravaganzas, she said: \u201dScene-y in a different way. You would be at a Gaultier show, and you weren\u2019t quite sure if you were going to get into the show or not. Today the scene is a lot more sedate. There are a lot of cameras now, a lot of people posing. There was none of that then. You were there for the show. It wasn\u2019t about getting your picture taken.\u201d Ms. Gilhart arrived at Barneys in 1992, when it was in the midst of a national expansion. She recalled Gene Pressman, whose grandfather Barney Pressman started the business in 1923, as \u201ca totally intimidating experience. I went into his office, and he was tossing this football. He said, \u2018I only hire really good-looking people.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Uh, O.K.\u2019 \u201d She was hired as a divisional merchandise manager, overseeing a team of buyers. Mr. Pressman became a mentor. \u201cHe was never afraid of things like Comme des Gar\u00e7ons,\u201d she said. \u201cHere\u2019s the big difference: nowadays a lot of people look at a designer and think, \u2018Can we sell that?\u2019 And the training here was, \u2018Look at a designer \u2014 your only hurdle was whether it\u2019s good or not \u2014 and we\u2019re going to figure out how to sell that.\u2019 \u201d One memorable appointment in Paris was with a 20-year-old Belgian, Olivier Theyskens, showing for the first time. \u201cThis was not a junior collection,\u201d Ms. Gilhart recalled, animated even years later. \u201cIt was already super-sophisticated.\u201d And Mr. Pressman didn\u2019t need convincing, she said. He operated on instinct. \u201cYou have to feel it,\u201d she said, alluding to some private equity firms that assess fashion companies based on their spreadsheets. \u201cThere is no formula.\u201d While Mr. Theyskens\u2019s initial designs were not manufactured, Barneys scooped up his second season. \u201cThey did the best buy,\u201d said Mr. Theyskens, now 36 and the creative director of Theory. When the Pressmans were forced out in 1999, Ms. Gilhart took over fashion direction, and despite Barneys\u2019 financial problems, continued to take risks. For the fall 2003 season, the store bought the entire thesis collection by two Parsons School of Design students, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez. Ms. Gilhart\u2019s confidence in them \u201ckick-started Proenza Schouler,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said. She \u201cwas there through our ups and downs,\u201d Mr. McCollough said, adding that the duo still values her advice. Ms. Gilhart also continued to endorse Mr. Theyskens. When the designer took the reins at Rochas in 2002, she arranged private runway shows where he could meet with select top shoppers. \u201cI have a very strong memory of that,\u201d said Mr. Theyskens. \u201cIt was one of the first times I had a real, engaging talk with specific customers. At the end of the day, our work, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about: to get presented and to have the customer have a relationship with the clothes.\u201d Now that Mr. Theyskens is based in New York, the two might grab coffee and walk through the company\u2019s meatpacking district flagship store, as they did one summer morning. Ms. Gilhart fingered a few knits and lingered over a supple leather cropped jacket. The cut was easy, a marked departure from Mr. Theyskens\u2019s earlier work for Rochas and later Nina Ricci, which drew some criticism for their impossibly skinny fits. Ms. Gilhart, though, is adamant that buyers not intervene too much with the visionary process. \u201cYou can say things to the designer, like \u2018We want more dresses,\u2019 but you\u2019re just following this person, lucky to engage with this talent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you have a hiccup in the business, it\u2019s like \u2018How can we work this out?\u2019 \u201d It\u2019s unclear what kind of traction Amazon will get in the world of New York fashion, but Ms. Collinson, now at Dior, seemed confident that her former colleague would survive regardless. \u201cJulie is like a dog with a bone; she is constantly searching,\u201d Ms. Collinson said. \u201cShe was, is, tenacious.\u201d Julie Gilhart has reinvented herself as a fashion consultant focusing on Web commerce. | Casey Kelbaugh for The New York Times | Ms. Gilhart with Stella McCartney in 2012. | Photo-Jonathon Ziegler/PatrickMcMullan.com | Attending the Suno show during New York Fashion Week in February. | Chelsea Lauren/Getty Images",

        "content": " Amazon  announced   this week that it would let customers who bought certain print books download the electronic versions of those titles for a small fee, or for free. For anyone who buys both kinds of books, myself included, the service, which Amazon calls Kindle MatchBook, raises a simple question: What took so long? Electronic books have been readily available since at least  2007 . But strangely bundling has never really taken off, despite Barnes & Noble experimenting with the concept   a few years ago. And it\u2019s unclear how many books Amazon\u2019s new service will include when it starts in October. The company has only announced the name of one major publisher, HarperCollins, who has agreed to participate in MatchBook,  according to   my colleague Nick Wingfield. Some in the publishing and retailing industries  have argued   that the technical issues associated with bundling are simply too complicated. Others seem opposed on the grounds that bundling would deprive authors of the full royalties they receive on the sale of each book \u2013 print or digital. But from the consumer perspective, bundling print and electronic books makes perfect sense. Few readers would be willing to pay full retail price for two versions of the same book but many would be willing to pay an extra $2.99 or $1.99 to have the electronic versions of the hardback and paperback they already own. Speaking for myself, I prefer print books when I am home or in the office because nothing beats the resolution of ink on paper, not even the Kindle\u2019s sharp display. But when I travel, I leave my physical books behind and carry a Kindle or an iPad, so I can easily carry multiple tiles. In some cases, having an electronic copy of a print book is also useful because it is easier to search the digital version by key words and phrases. And some readers who prefer reading on an electronic device still like to own print books as ornaments that can be displayed on bookshelves, coffee tables and night stands. Publishers and booksellers still reluctant to try bundling should look to companies in the newspaper and music businesses for inspiration. While those companies have also struggled financially like the book business, at least they are now letting their customers use their products seamlessly in the physical and digital realms.",

        "name": "Kindle in Japan: Late, but still dominant ",
        "content": " When Rakuten, Japan\u2019s leading e-commerce company, introduced its Kobo e-reader in Japan in July 2012, the company\u2019s chief executive, Hiroshi Mikitani, presented a gift to Yoshinobu Noma, the president of Kodansha, Japan\u2019s largest publisher. It was a T-shirt emblazoned with \u2018\u2018Beat Amazon.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Mikitani wanted to signal that the two companies had no intention of slugging it out in a print-versus-digital fight in Japan. The alliance did little to help them defend against Amazon.com. Four months later, Amazon brought its Kindle e-reader to Japan. It quickly became Japan\u2019s top-selling e-reader, gaining 38.3 percent of the market, according to the MM Research Institute, a data firm in Tokyo. Even though Kobo had beaten Kindle to market by nearly five months, it grabbed only 33 percent of Japan\u2019s e-reader sales during the same 12-month period. Sony, which had stated its goal of selling half of all e-readers by 2012, managed to hold only 25.5 percent with its devices. Amazon sells its Kindle in 14 countries, Japan being the very latest. Misao Konishi, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to talk about the company\u2019s goals for the Japanese market, but she did offer some insight into Amazon\u2019s ambitions. \u2018\u2018Every book ever printed, in every language, available to buy in 60 seconds,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Konishi said. \u2018\u2018There are many things to accomplish in order to achieve that vision in Japan.\u2019\u2019 The Kindle\u2019s quick success is a stark contrast to the Japanese companies\u2019 efforts. Until Amazon showed up, e-readers failed to live up to expectations. Sony brought out the first reader using E Ink technology in Japan in 2004, the Librie. Buyers of the Librie, which like early Kindles showed black text on a white background, suffered from a convoluted marketplace that allowed them only to rent e-books, not buy them. Amazon, which developed its Kindle with digital books people could buy from \u2014 where else? \u2014 Amazon.com, found instant success after its introduction in the United States in 2007. Sony stopped selling its device that year. The company\u2019s subsequent e-readers, even after Sony developed a library of books to buy, have met with limited success. Japan is not a big contributor to global e-reader sales, estimated at around 19.9 million units by IDC, a market research firm. MM Research said that a total of 470,000 devices had been sold there last year, and that it expected sales to climb about 10 percent, to 520,000 units, in 2014. Amazon\u2019s victory over Sony and Rakuten, which got into the e-reader business when it bought the Toronto-based Kobo in November 2011, began with aggressive pricing. Amazon sold the Kindle Paperwhite for \u00a57,980, or about $80 at current exchange rates. Not only was its price about $40 less than it was in the United States, it also matched that of the Rakuten Kobo and the Sony PRS-T2. In a bid to gain market share, Rakuten dropped the price of its e-reader in July to \u00a55,480, and it will continue to focus on the basic model, even as the company introduces the new high-end Kobo Aura HD in Europe and the United States this month. But Amazon was not winning just because of price. It also gave consumers another reason to prefer the Kindle. \u2018\u2018The reason for the Kindle\u2019s success in Japan is the same as it was in America,\u2019\u2019 said Munechika Nishida, author of \u2018\u2018The Truth About the E-book Revolution\u2019\u2019 and a technology analyst. \u2018\u2018The Amazon Web store is the easiest to use, the easiest to understand.\u2019\u2019 Sony and Rakuten\u2019s e-readers are not technologically inferior to the Kindle, Mr. Nishida said, but buying e-books on the Kindle marketplace takes fewer steps. Rakuten and Sony\u2019s devices make browsing and purchasing more difficult, he said. The Japan Kindle store, which opened last October, offers more than 140,000 Japanese-language titles. It added 7,000 more titles in just the past 30 days. Kodansha now has 10,617 e-book titles available on the Kindle marketplace. The Kobo store advertises more than 130,000 e-books, but its limited search capabilities make browsing difficult. The Sony marketplace offers more than 108,000 Japanese-language titles. Rakuten\u2019s latest bid to challenge the global dominance of companies like Amazon came Monday, with the announcement that it planned to purchase Viki, a Singapore-based video streaming platform similar to the U.S. site Hulu, but known for its focus on popular television dramas from South Korea and Taiwan and on anime. The details of the deal are not yet public, but the Japanese e-commerce giant will reportedly pay $200 million for the on-demand television and movie-streaming site, which was founded in 2007. Before the Kindle\u2019s arrival, Kobo and Sony\u2019s marketplaces each offered fewer than 80,000 e-book titles. Without a popular marketplace, Rakuten and Sony failed to convince the top two Japanese publishers, Kodansha and Shogakukan, of the profit-generating potential in e-books. Digitalization of their titles proceeded slowly. Amazon, however, had experience in the United States selling e-books and brought that experience to Japan. That made all the difference for fence-sitting publishers experiencing dwindling profits. Sales of books and magazines in Japan declined 3.6 percent in 2012, according to the Research Institute for Publications, the eighth consecutive year of declining sales. E-book and e-magazine sales, however, increased an estimated 18 percent, and the growth potential for e-publishing in Japan is expected to increase following proposed changes in copyright law announced last month by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. The changes, aimed at combating piracy and developing the e-book industry in Japan, are on the agenda for next year\u2019s Parliament session. Nao Takada, a 26-year-old employee of the Japan Automobile Federation, was visiting a Tokyo bookstore, but she, like readers in other parts of the world, may be buying less there. She said she had bought the Kindle Paperwhite because it was small and easy to carry, and she added that she liked the ease with which she could browse purchases. \u2018\u2018I still go to regular bookstores,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Takada said, \u2018\u2018but a lot of times I just browse, find something to buy, then go home and download it on Amazon.\u2019\u2019 In the Jimbocho neighborhood of Tokyo, famous for more than 100 years for its used and specialty bookshops, Hiroshi Kobayashi of Komiyama Books said people sometimes used their smartphones to snap photos of books they planned to download later. Still, he said that he did not consider the Kindle a threat to his livelihood \u2014 yet. \u2018\u2018Eventually, they\u2019ll begin making electronic versions of these older, rare books,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Kobayashi said. \u2018\u2018Then I\u2019ll have something to worry about.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "As Amazon grows, it reshapes downtown Seattle; Bezos\u2019 ambitious plans create an influx to once desolate neighborhood ",
        "content": " Often a corporation with a grand dream to reshape a city wants tax breaks in return. Not Amazon. When Amazon.com executives showed up last year for the first meetings about their proposal to build a new headquarters here \u2014 three towers that would draw thousands of workers downtown \u2014 city officials were taken aback. Not by the scope of the plan, but by the simplicity of the discussion. The executives said they were ready to break ground immediately on what would be one of the biggest development projects in city history. \u2018\u2018It was not a hard-boiled negotiation,\u2019\u2019 said Marshall Foster, the director of city planning. \u2018\u2018They basically walked in and said, \u2018We think this is the site.\u2019\u2019\u2019 A shovel-ready company that is clear and confident and with the cash to back it up \u2018\u2018doesn\u2019t happen very often,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Foster added. Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, has a reputation for the grand gesture, a knack for seizing an opportunity that can remake a landscape. His purchase of The Washington Post this month for $250 million cash, a bet that others might have shied away from, is a case in point. Here, in his company\u2019s hometown, Mr. Bezos has put his chips on the idea of Seattle and urban America itself. The first headquarters tower is already under construction, and the company occupies 14 smaller buildings nearby. The result in South Lake Union, previously a low-rise, low-rent warehouse district with ties to Seattle\u2019s gritty maritime past, is a flood of cash, construction detours and dust. Increases to the city\u2019s tax base aside, some people are apprehensive about whether the growth could outstrip the city\u2019s ability to keep up. \u2018\u2018South Lake Union was a place that people drove through, not to,\u2019\u2019 John Schoettler, Amazon\u2019s director of global real estate and facilities, said in an interview. \u2018\u2018Once we started development there, everything started to spring up around us.\u2019\u2019 The once-empty streets are flooded at lunchtime with Amazon workers, easily identified by their blue employee badges. Fleets of food trucks have arrived, offering Thai, Mexican and other fare. On a nice day, workers take their lunches to a park next to the Museum of History and Industry, which was recently renovated with a $10 million contribution from Mr. Bezos. The company already has about 15,000 employees in Seattle, mostly highly paid engineers, managers and programmers, out of a global work force of about 97,000, according to people familiar with its head count who were not authorized to discuss a figure that the company does not share publicly. The new towers have a capacity for 12,000, giving the company room for nearly 30,000 workers in Seattle, which has a population of 635,000. \u2018\u2018Nobody else in the downtown area has ever had this kind of impact,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Griffin, a 35-year veteran of the Seattle economic scene and the managing partner at the Pine Street Group, a real estate marketing and development company. But the Amazon effect only starts with its own big numbers. The thousands of new employees, recently hired or anticipated, have also caught the attention of apartment developers. Last year, Seattle issued more new residential building permits than in any year since at least 1984, when the current system of record-keeping began. Many of those new apartments are within walking or biking distance of Amazon. Service businesses and start-up technology companies, meanwhile, have sought nearby addresses. Northeastern University, based in Boston, set up a remote campus last year across the street from Amazon\u2019s current buildings. \u2018\u2018I think they\u2019ve single-handedly defined a whole region,\u2019\u2019 said Bryan Trussel, the chief executive of Glympse, an Internet start-up with offices next to Amazon. \u2018\u2018Now everyone wants to be there.\u2019\u2019 The setting is significant. In casting its lot in the center of a congested, bustling city, Amazon has rejected the old model of the suburban company campus that is typical of Silicon Valley and the technology ring road around Boston. The old way is perhaps most vividly exemplified by Microsoft. Its offices, and most of its 42,000 local employees, are in the suburb of Redmond. But it was, perhaps paradoxically, Microsoft money that made Amazon\u2019s torrid growth in the neighborhood possible. In the early 1990s, Paul Allen, Microsoft\u2019s billionaire co-founder, agreed to help finance the creation of a public park starting in South Lake Union, a project that was eventually killed by voters. As a result, Mr. Allen\u2019s investment firm, Vulcan, ended up being a big landowner in the area, eventually selling or leasing many of its buildings to Amazon. Other technology companies are moving into urban spaces. Twitter and Dropbox, the social networking and online storage services, have made San Francisco home, while Tumblr and Etsy, blogging and shopping sites, are in New York. Google has huge urban spaces from Paris to Pittsburgh. The appeal of cities to potential employees is part of the reason for the shift. An urban setting, with access to good restaurants, nightclubs and cultural attractions, has become as important a recruiting tool as salary or benefits for many companies. But most of those urban pioneers are still small, at least in their real estate and staffing needs. Twitter, one of the largest, employs about 1,500 workers in San Francisco. Amazon, by contrast, is both local and global. By encouraging its employees to live within walking distance, it could help Seattle meet its goals for energy efficiency and conservation, city officials said. As part of its development agreement, Amazon also plans to buy a new streetcar for the light rail line that runs past its properties and pay for a stretch of dedicated bicycle lane. Mr. Schoettler, Amazon\u2019s real estate director, said environmental considerations were an important factor in the company\u2019s decision to remain in Seattle, along with the type of employee that an urban location attracts. \u2018\u2018The energy and excitement from employees being in an urban environment \u2014 I hear it daily,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Schoettler, who walks to work. \u2018\u2018A lot of people don\u2019t even have a car. They want that urban experience right there.\u2019\u2019 By contrast, Microsoft\u2019s private bus line, called the Connector, is a common sight snaking through neighborhoods in Seattle and other local communities. Of the company\u2019s 42,012 employees in the Seattle area, nearly half are registered to ride, a spokeswoman for the company said in an e-mail. Amazon\u2019s transformative rush presents challenges for Seattle. Officials must manage the de facto city-within-a-city that is emerging around the company, with a surge of new restaurants, apartment complexes and commercial buildings. The new headquarters has limited parking, putting pressure on mass transit, which was crimped this year by a financing stalemate in the State Legislature. The city wants low-cost housing in the Amazon zone, but soaring rents and real estate prices, city officials said, will make that goal difficult to achieve. The company\u2019s business model, and tactics in avoiding state sales taxes in many states, also challenge retailers. And the company\u2019s mostly young work force may want to raise children here, requiring a new public school where none exists. The city has allocated $5 million for an elementary school, but planners are wrestling with a dilemma. A school built now could sit empty, they said, but waiting until the need arises might be too late if young families start moving elsewhere. \u2018\u2018As the city grows \u2014 and again, it\u2019s a good problem to have, one that other cities don\u2019t \u2014 we have to keep investing in all of our places,\u2019\u2019 Mike McGinn, the mayor of Seattle, said. \u2018\u2018How do we make sure we preserve the things that make the city special?\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " SEATTLE -- On occasion, I visit a small store in my neighborhood only to find a sign saying the store is closed for an hour or so. It's mildly irritating, but it has never occurred to me that those moments are worth freaking out over. Such restraint was not universally exercised on Monday, when people ran to social media to voice outrage about a rare Amazon service hiccup. That followed a pattern that we have come to expect now, after a week in which several of the Internet's biggest companies went dark for a time. Google did not work for five minutes the other day, while parts of Microsoft's Outlook.com Web mail service were out of commission for several days last week. A problem during regular site maintenance knocked the Web site of The New York Times offline for a couple of hours last week, too. Of course, the downtime presents some sort of financial consequences for these companies. BuzzFeed took out its calculator and decided that Amazon could lose $1,104 in sales for every second its American site was down. If you're like me, you simply went back when the site resumed service and made your purchase then. Around the time Amazon went dark, I was about to buy an air mattress for some house guests coming to visit. Once the short shutdown was over, I made my order, and I have the utmost confidence my mattress is being stuffed into a corrugated cardboard box at an Amazon warehouse. Some Web breakdowns are, of course, more serious. EBay had a well-known one that lasted nearly a full day back in 1999, when people were just beginning to realize how vexing it could be when always-on dot-com services vanished from their browsers. Investors crushed eBay's stock back then. Amazon's stock closed up slightly on Monday. Still, there is still impatience when the Web's favorite sites disappear, as Amazon did Monday. And people let it be known. These microfailures have become a curious new form of entertainment, like a fire drill that forces everyone to empty out an office building. The Twitter user Pourmecoffee captured the spirit of the moment on Monday with a joke about the primitive state of existence people must revert to in an Amazon blackout: Amazon is down! I have two disease-free chickens to barter directly for a curved blacksmith's veining chisel which I need in great haste. -- pourmecoffee (@pourmecoffee) 19 Aug 13",

They provide access to all the episodes of the Emmy-nominated \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and stockpiles of timeless black-and-white films, courtesy of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, as well as to the Web comedies and endless viral videos on YouTube. This year, Netflix cited the proliferation of these devices \u2014 \u201c inexpensive smart TV adapters ,\u201d it called them \u2014 when it predicted that on-demand and mobile TV would be the rule instead of the exception. To back up its prediction, the company also stated that \u201csmart TV sales are increasing and eventually every TV will have Wi-Fi and apps.\u201d Some already do. But until all TVs are smart, it falls on the backs of these streaming devices \u2014 most of them handy, but none of them yet perfect \u2014 to help a staid TV dip a cord into the future. THE GAMERS Millions of Americans already have a streaming device connected to a TV. Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation and Nintendo Wii video game consoles offer streaming video options and are among the most popular ways to tap into Internet TV. With a few simple clicks, the consoles can download apps for services like Netflix and Amazon Instant Video. Downloading them is free, but many require a paid subscription to actually stream video. (An Xbox also requires a subscription to the Xbox Live service for use of its Internet interface.) The consoles\u2019 controllers make navigating through lists of TV shows a breeze. And with the Xbox and PlayStation, there is also the option of buying an individual episode or season of a show through the Xbox Video Store or the PlayStation Store, in case it is not available on one of the streaming services. THE BEAMERS A problem with the gaming devices is that they all take a couple of minutes to boot up. (And with all the video available, time is of the essence. After all, there are hours and hours of \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d to watch.) That is not the case with a couple of other popular options, including Apple TV and Google\u2019s Chromecast, that can also beam videos from a phone or laptop to the TV screen. Why \u201cbeam\u201d? You might start watching a YouTube video on your iPhone and decide that you want to show it to your family \u2014 in that case, you would click a button on a smartphone and stream it on the TV set. Or you might be curious about an interview streaming live on YouTube. You can find the live stream on a laptop and push it to the big screen. When it comes to Apple TV, probably the most powerful of the beaming devices, the name can be misleading. It is not a television set or a cable channel or a full-blown competitor to Netflix. Rather, it\u2019s a sleek black box, shaped like a hockey puck, that connects to a TV set. Not surprisingly, given Apple\u2019s penchant for design, Apple TV is probably the most attractive of all the Internet TV adapters on the market. Apple promotes the device\u2019s $99 price, but it is actually more expensive \u2014 you will need to buy an HDMI cable to connect the box to the back of your TV. And the device\u2019s AirPlay beaming function works only with Apple phones, tablets and computers, so it\u2019s not as appealing if you are not in the Apple family already. Google\u2019s $35 Chromecast, one of the newest ways to make TV sets smarter, looks like a flash drive and plugs into an HDMI port on your TV. Using your home Wi-Fi, it will project on the TV whatever you are watching on your mobile device or computer. Google Android, Apple and Microsoft Windows devices are all welcome here. But Chromecast does not come with video apps the way Apple TV or the video game consoles do, so it is entirely dependent on the second device that you are using to find TV episodes or films, which can make it feel too constricting. On the other end of this plug-in spectrum are boxes like the Roku, which can be found online for as little as $40, and the slightly more expensive WD TV Play from Western Digital. These boxes have apps galore, even for streaming services you\u2019ve never heard of. But the Roku, the best known of this bunch, is just beginning to enable beaming from other screens. There are surely more of these boxes to come \u2014 Amazon is said to  have  one in the works , for example. THE FUTURE Of course, there is still promise that the TV itself will become smart. Some TVs already have Wi-Fi and Internet apps built in, allowing viewers to pause Netflix with the same remote control used to turn up the volume. Increasingly, these TVs will negate the need for special adapters, but in the meantime, the adapters are the best window into the television revolution. After a short while with Netflix via Apple TV or YouTube via Xbox or Hulu via Chromecast, you might wonder why anyone pays for cable television anymore. All the evidence until now suggests that for most people Internet streams are a supplement to cable, not a replacement. The way things are going, viewers may subscribe to more packages of TV in the future, not fewer of them, because of the convenience and sense of control that comes along with each. One thing is certain: strong winds of change are coming to TV. The streaming devices seem to be just the first step. Sony, Intel,  Google   and other companies are interested in selling a cablelike package of channels via the Internet, challenging incumbents like Comcast and Time Warner Cable. Apple is taking a different tack, collaborating with those incumbents to make it easier for viewers to watch TV on their own terms. For now, then, it may be best to think of the streaming devices as Trojan horses for the technology giants that manufacture them. Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon all want a seat at the table in TV\u2019s future. And these devices are a start. For now, it may be best to think of streaming devices as trojan horses for the technology giants that manufacture them: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and the like all want a seat at the table of the future of TV. | Julia Yellow",

        "content": " SEATTLE \u2014 On occasion, I visit a small store in my neighborhood only to find a sign saying the store is closed for an hour or so. It\u2019s mildly irritating, but it has never occurred to me that those moments are worth freaking out over. Such restraint was not universally exercised on Monday, when people ran to social media to voice outrage about a rare Amazon service hiccup. That followed a pattern that we have come to expect now, after a week in which several of the Internet\u2019s biggest companies went dark for a time. Google did not work for  five minutes   the other day, while parts of Microsoft\u2019s Outlook.com Web mail service were  out of commission   for several days last week. A problem during regular site maintenance  knocked   the Web site of The New York Times offline for a couple of hours last week, too. Of course, the downtime presents some sort of financial consequences for these companies. BuzzFeed took out its calculator and  decided   that Amazon could lose $1,104 in sales for every second its American site was down. If you\u2019re like me, you simply went back when the site resumed service and made your purchase then. Around the time Amazon went dark, I was about to buy an air mattress for some house guests coming to visit. Once the short shutdown was over, I made my order, and I have the utmost confidence my mattress is being stuffed into a corrugated cardboard box at an Amazon warehouse. Some Web breakdowns are, of course, more serious. EBay had a  well-known   one that lasted nearly a full day back in 1999, when people were just beginning to realize how vexing it could be when always-on dot-com services vanished from their browsers. Investors crushed eBay\u2019s stock back then. Amazon\u2019s stock closed up slightly on Monday. Still, there is still impatience when the Web\u2019s favorite sites disappear, as Amazon did Monday. And people let it be known. These microfailures have become a curious new form of entertainment, like a fire drill that forces everyone to empty out an office building. The Twitter user Pourmecoffee captured the spirit of the moment on Monday with a  joke   about the primitive state of existence people must revert to in an Amazon blackout: Amazon is down! I have two disease-free chickens to barter directly for a curved blacksmith\u2019s veining chisel which I need in great haste. \u2014   pourmecoffee (@pourmecoffee) 19 Aug 13 Google Asks Secret Court for Permission to Publish National Security Request Data Google Calls U.S. Data Request Disclosures a Step Backward for  Users Daily Report: Google, Facebook and Microsoft Ask to Reveal U.S. Data  Requests Is Google More Like Microsoft or Apple?

        "name": "A Trophy Owner Also Familiar With Turmoil ",
        "content": " Jeff Bezos\u2019s purchase of The Washington Post raises the possibility that he acquired the paper as a trophy to celebrate his success as the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com. The acquisition comes after the purchase of The Boston Globe by John W. Henry, the owner of the Boston Red Sox and a trading firm billionaire. The purchases are part of a broader trend toward private ownership of media companies. A classic economic study by Harold Demsetz and Kenneth Lehn finds that concentrated ownership might be explained by the \u201camenity potential\u201d of certain companies, including mass media and sports teams. John Henry\u2019s holdings nicely illustrate both. As the authors explain, winning the World Series or \u201cbelieving that one is systematically influencing public opinion\u201d may provide consumption benefits to the owners even if profits are diminished. The study raises another possibility, however. Concentrated ownership works better in highly volatile environments, where rapid change and external forces make it difficult for public shareholders to monitor and judge the performance of managers. In such \u201chigh agency cost\u201d environments, it may be more efficient for a single owner or a dominant shareholder to keep an eye on how managers are dealing with rapid change and disruptive innovation. \u201cThe noisier a firm\u2019s environment, the greater the payoff to owners in maintaining tighter control,\u201d the paper explains. \u201cHence, noisier environments should give rise to more concentrated ownership structures.\u201d Mr. Bezos has proven highly talented at managing in disruptive, innovative environments. Amazon is a publicly traded company, but Mr. Bezos remains the dominant shareholder, consistent with what the Demsetz and Lehn study predicts. Perhaps the right to control The Washington Post is worth more when Mr. Bezos owns the company. Not because it\u2019s a trophy, or to save the world, but simply because an experienced and talented captain gets to steer the boat through the rough seas ahead.

        "content": " Early employees of Amazon.com still remember the day the company took away their aspirin. It was late 1999. After years of heady excess, the Internet boom was beginning to falter. Amazon, among the most celebrated of the dot-coms, was burdened with debt and spiraling losses. Jeffrey P. Bezos, its founder and chief impresario, had to impress Wall Street that he was serious about cutting costs. But how? Amazon had never indulged employees with Silicon Valley perks like massages or sushi chefs. Just about the only thing that workers received free was aspirin. So the aspirin went. The removal created a lot of muttering, but the cost-cutting \u2014 including layoffs \u2014 and promises of future profit helped Amazon escape the jaws of doom. And now, 14 years later, Mr. Bezos, 49, has become so rich and successful that he can surprise the world by buying The Washington Post for $250 million. No one, apparently including Mr. Bezos himself, seems to know what he intends to do with that fabled newspaper. This is, after all, a man who says the quality he most wanted in a wife was someone who would be best at springing him from a third-world prison. He can probably be counted on to think unpredictably. The aspirin takeaway and similar incidents over the course of Mr. Bezos\u2019 career show a determination to do whatever is necessary to succeed and a fanatic attention to detail, even at the expense of appearing ridiculous. Also, he does not care about your headache. \u2018\u2018Jeff may be outwardly goofy, with that trademark laugh, but he\u2019s a very tough guy,\u2019\u2019 said James Marcus, who was Amazon employee No. 55. \u2018\u2018If he goes even halfway through with his much-vaunted reinvention of journalism, there is no way he\u2019s not going to break some eggs.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos is the sole founder, the public face, the largest shareholder and the visionary of Amazon. \u2018\u2018For many of us, creating earth\u2019s biggest bookstore would have been enough,\u2019\u2019 said Kerry Fried, employee No. 251. \u2018\u2018Jeff\u2019s goal was a touch grander: to conquer the world.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos has more than his share of detractors \u2014 just ask your neighborhood bookseller, if you can find one. But it is increasingly hard to dispute that he is the natural heir of Steven P. Jobs as the entrepreneur with the most effect on the way people live now. Amazon, which is as much a reflection of Mr. Bezos\u2019 personality as a corporation worth $125 billion can be, is by far the fastest-growing major retailer, although that simple label long ago ceased to suffice. It is also a movie studio, an art gallery(a 1962 Picasso, \u2018\u2018Jacqueline au Chapeau Noir,\u2019\u2019 can be had for $175,000) and a publisher. It is an empire that spans much of the globe and even has its own currency, Amazon coins. What it does not have much of, and never did, are traditional profits. The company has all sorts of regulatory and competitive concerns, making for a minefield of possible conflicts of interest for The Post. Amazon has opposed states\u2019 efforts to have e-commerce companies collect sales tax. It was the main beneficiary of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s successful pursuit of five publishers and Apple on antitrust grounds. It is locking horns with major companies like Wal-Mart Stores and I.B.M. And as it expands into same-day delivery of its products, it will come up against grocery chains and drugstores. Through its thriving data storage division, Amazon is becoming an important contractor to the government bureaucracy that is a mainstay of The Post\u2019s reporting. If persistent rumors are true and the company produces an Amazon phone, yet another set of antagonists will arise. Other newspaper publishers have similar, if fewer, conflicts. The Washington Post Co. owned Kaplan, a for-profit education company that came under congressional scrutiny, and the company fought efforts to impose regulations. But the newspaper nonetheless maintained its commitment to investigative journalism. Some argue that it would to take more than Mr. Bezos to transform that culture. \u2018\u2018Newsrooms are very conservative,\u2019\u2019 said Bill Buzenberg, executive director for the Center for Public Integrity. \u2018\u2018They have difficulty changing, and certainly they have difficulty selling out their core principles.\u2019\u2019 Perhaps. But then, few newsrooms have ever been confronted with a new owner whose zeal for disruption is matched by his obsession with tinkering until he gets it right. As Steve Yegge, a former employee, once put it, \u2018\u2018He just makes ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies.\u2019\u2019 A relevant fact: Mr. Bezos originally thought of naming Amazon \u2018\u2018Relentless.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Marcus, now the executive editor of Harper\u2019s Magazine, said it all made sense, kind of: \u2018\u2018Bezos is fascinated by broken business models. And whatever else you think of newspapers, the business model is broken.\u2019\u2019 There is a reason that not even the most imaginative media critics ever thought that Jeff Bezos might one day buy The Washington Post: he has never seemed a fan of journalism or journalists. He gives interviews only when he has something to promote, and always stays on message. He likes his privacy; there are no \u2018\u2018at home with\u2019\u2019 magazine features with him lounging with his wife, MacKenzie, and four children at his luxurious Seattle estate. Amazon\u2019s earnings calls are festivals of vagueness. Even a number as basic, and presumably impressive, as how many Kindle e-readers the company sells is never released. There are no bold signs on its growing Seattle headquarters complex to identify what is contained within. And there are fewer leaks out of Amazon than from the National Security Agency. The philanthropic Bill Gates, whose wife, Melinda, served on The Post\u2019s board, might have been a more likely buyer. Mark Zuckerberg, who adopted Donald E. Graham, the Post Co.\u2019s chief executive, as a mentor, could have been plausible. When it turned out to be Mr. Bezos instead, no one minded admitting astonishment. Neither his managerial style nor his entrepreneurial success nor his passion for secrecy seem to transfer over to his newest possession. \u2018\u2018Every story you ever see about Amazon, it has that sentence: \u2018An Amazon spokesman declined to comment,\u2019\u2019\u2019 Mr. Marcus said. Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment. Though indisputably one of the great marvels of the age, Amazon is a curious beast that offers few obvious lessons for how a newspaper like The Post might become profitable. Financial writers have noted that Apple makes more than twice as much money in a quarter than Amazon earned during the entire last decade. Last quarter, Amazon had a net loss of $7 million. But Wall Street loves Amazon anyway. One big reason is that Amazon tends to be lavish with its customers. It sells to them at a discount, will often ship free and, if a customer wants to return an item, will refund the money before even receiving the return. Sometimes it will even do more. Say you buy a book, and then decide it is not for you. You tell Amazon you are returning it. You might get a message like this: \u2018\u2018Keep this item and receive a refund! It\u2019s on us!\u2019\u2019 That is a sure way to win friends and lose money. But Wall Street believes that the company will someday \u2018\u2018monetize\u2019\u2019 tens of millions of customers \u2014 in other words, make a real profit each time it sells them something. Maybe next year. Or the year after. From the very beginning, Mr. Bezos has made Amazon an investment story about the company\u2019s potential rather than its reality. People who have worked closely with Mr. Bezos say he refuses to waste time on anything that is not directly about the customer. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s where his ego is,\u2019\u2019 one former colleague said. As technology companies grow old and big, they strive to keep the energy and boldness of the start-ups they once were. They almost always fail. Amazon is the exception. \u2018\u2018If a new product was launching, sometimes the day would never end,\u2019\u2019 a former employee said. As an Amazon joke has it, work-life balance is for people who do not like their work. In Seattle, of course, the employees are well compensated with a stock that has risen 600 percent in the past five years. Out in the warehouses, where most of Amazon\u2019s 90,000 employees work, starting pay is about $12 an hour and workers can quickly lose their jobs if they slow down. It was so hot in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in May 2011 that some workers at the Amazon warehouse there collapsed. Another company with different attitudes might have installed air-conditioning, or simply sent workers home during heat spells. If Amazon did that, however, East Coast customers might not get their Jay-Z CDs or diapers or jars of heather honey as quickly as they expected. So the company chose a different solution. It arranged to station ambulances and paramedics out front during five days of excessive heat, according to The Morning Call, the Pennsylvania newspaper that broke the story. Fifteen workers were taken to area hospitals after they fell, and as many as 30 more were treated by paramedics at the warehouse. Workers quoted by the paper said the heat index in the facility, a measure that includes humidity, was as high as 114 degrees Fahrenheit (46 Celsius). Amazon declined to cooperate with the newspaper, even when it later installed air-conditioning. It is unlikely that Mr. Bezos will treat The Post\u2019s reporters the way he treated his warehouse workers. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t expect him to turn off the air-conditioning,\u2019\u2019 said Ken Doctor, an analyst at Outsell. But Mr. Doctor suggested that Mr. Bezos did have one particularly relevant area of expertise: gathering data and using it to figure out what consumers want. \u2018\u2018The Washington Post has a major political news audience,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Doctor said. \u2018\u2018Yet it hasn\u2019t been able to segment that audience commercially.\u2019\u2019 One other competency that Mr. Bezos has: money, and lots of it. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s not a person in this world that can save the newspaper industry,\u2019\u2019 said Craig Huber, an independent research analyst. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s going to be dealing with operating losses as far as the eye can see. I think The Washington Post sold to him because he\u2019s going to be more willing to absorb those losses.\u2019\u2019 A core role for any newspaper is to cover the local government. For The Post, that includes the federal government. In recent years, however, Amazon has become a government contractor \u2014 in effect, the government\u2019s digital filing cabinet. Amazon Web Services, Mr. Bezos\u2019s cloud computing operation, is the world\u2019s largest service for third-party rental of computing and data storage. Besides hundreds of thousands of individuals and businesses, more than 2,000 research institutions and 500 government institutions worldwide use A.W.S. Amazon runs several large data centers, each containing of hundreds of thousands of servers, along with 42 smaller facilities around the world. The operations of the data centers, like most other details about A.W.S., are a closely held secret. Even the company\u2019s senior executives must have a valid reason to be inside one of the big facilities. In addition to the eight major centers, A.W.S. operates a separate data center, called GovCloud, for the U.S. government. GovCloud is compliant with the government\u2019s International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, controls. Only U.S. citizens can use the computers. Much other government work, for both the United States and foreign governments, is done in other A.W.S. centers as well. In one important recent development, A.W.S. was awarded a contract valued at $600 million to provide computing services to the C.I.A. James Staten, an analyst with Forrester Research, said the C.I.A. contract was a breakthrough for Amazon. \u2018\u2018Every other national intelligence service will want the same kind of computing, if they can get it,\u2019\u2019 he said. Every other cloud services company, meanwhile, wants a piece of the action. I.B.M. formally protested the award on undisclosed grounds. The Government Accountability Office, while finding generally for Amazon, said the C.I.A. should re-examine the deal. Amazon is expected to officially apply for the original award to stand. Although Mr. Bezos, not Amazon, bought The Post, his role as Amazon\u2019s chief executive and biggest shareholder makes for awkward relationships. Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security Studies, said, \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a serious potential conflict of interest for a major newspaper like The Washington Post to have a contractual relationship with the government and the most secret part of the government.\u2019\u2019 But Steve Aftergood, director of the project on government secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, said that if The Washington Post did not publish a story about the C.I.A. because of Amazon\u2019s business relationship with the agency, \u2018\u2018there would be no shortage of other venues that would be eager to publish the information in question.\u2019\u2019 Bob Woodward, The Post\u2019s most famous reporter, said he had first met Mr. Bezos at a conference in Colorado about a decade ago and that they had spoken \u2018\u2018a number of times at those conferences and elsewhere.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Woodward said that when he discussed projects and books with Mr. Bezos, \u2018\u2018he always struck me as very serious about it and in tune with the values of independence, aggressiveness.\u2019\u2019 He added that he hoped that because Mr. Bezos would run a company that was \u2018\u2018customer-focused,\u2019\u2019 the entrepreneur would recognize how much readers appreciate high-quality reporting. Mr. Bezos has made the right noises. Referencing a famous assertion that John N. Mitchell, President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s 1972 campaign director, directed at Katharine Graham, The Post\u2019s publisher, the Amazon chief wrote in a letter to Post employees that \u2018\u2018while I hope no one ever threatens to put one of my body parts through a wringer, if they do, thanks to Mrs. Graham\u2019s example, I\u2019ll be ready.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos\u2019s critics, however, have been clamoring to put him through a wringer for years now. Leaving aside the complaints of bookstores, publishers and distributors, all groups whose viability he is challenging, two controversies seem to prefigure the sort of conflicts he will have as The Post\u2019s new owner. WikiLeaks briefly used Amazon Web Services in late 2010 to host its purloined classified documents, but then Amazon pulled the plug. The company said that contrary to news reports, it was not acting at the government\u2019s request. Instead, it said it had taken WikiLeaks offline for violating Amazon\u2019s rules against posting material you do not own. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said Amazon \u2018\u2018ran away with its tail between its legs.\u2019\u2019 A more recent complaint involves the opposite of the WikiLeaks situation: a site that Amazon is declining to shut down. Ask.fm, a Web site for anonymous teenagers, is being blamed in the British media for allowing cyberbullying in the suicides of four youths. Amazon, which reportedly hosts Ask.fm, has been asked to take it down for violating its rules against hate speech. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment. Largely overlooked in the commentary over what Mr. Bezos will do with The Post is the fact that he has already commanded a large editorial team. In the early days of Amazon, he set up a department to produce reviews of the books that Amazon was selling. It was an impressive gesture: Whoever heard of a store with editors? But it offered Amazon instant credibility. Mr. Bezos never suggested that the reviews be positive, and he gave the department his full support. Until he did not. People at Amazon at the time describe a struggle between the high-minded humans and the data-driven Vulcans, otherwise known as masters of business administration. The Vulcans said that few customers actually read the reviews, so maybe Amazon should not spend so much to produce them. \u2018\u2018It was a culture war, and the Vulcans won,\u2019\u2019 said Tim Appelo, who worked in the editorial department. \u2018\u2018Many people in Amazon editorial were embittered because Bezos scuttled us.\u2019\u2019 The professional reviews yielded to the innovation of customer reviews \u2014 sometimes an impartial evaluation, sometimes a love song by the author\u2019s mother disguised as an impartial evaluation. There was no way to tell, and no one in management seemed to care. Many of the reviewers quit or were laid off. Mr. Appelo was not bitter. In fact, he went back to Amazon for a second stint, introducing its digital video store in 2006. (He is now at The Hollywood Reporter.) \u2018\u2018Bezos knows that there is a difference between the marketplace and the marketplace for ideas,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Appelo said. \u2018\u2018Bezos is relentlessly and ruthlessly inventive, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll indulge his Vulcan side too much.\u2019\u2019 Put like that, it sounds somewhere between a gut feeling and a heartfelt wish. In these troubled times for newspapers, that may be the most they can expect.",

As a companion to a  major profile this weekend by David   Streitfeld and Christine Haughney , here is a sampler of previous articles tracing what he has accomplished and how he has been perceived. 1999 Some of the coverage is downright skeptical, like  a 1999 article from The New York Times Magazine , in which the reporter Peter de Jonge notes that \u201cno matter what new foray or feature Bezos is trumpeting, he always keeps our filmy gaze locked on the future.\u201d But with online retailers spending 10 times as much per sale on marketing as physical retailers, he says, \u201cUntil Bezos and other Internet retailers can find a way to attract and keep customers without such an enormous outlay, they are all going to have a hard time making any money.\u201d 2002 Three years later, Mr. Bezos was a 38-year-old billionaire who\u2019d floated high with the Internet bubble and fell hard as it burst.  His company was steadily regaining ground , according to the reporter Leslie Kaufman, but had a central vulnerability. \u201cLook, they\u2019ve shown us that the book business can be a very nice, profitable business online,\u201d said Mark J. Rowen, a senior Internet analyst at Prudential Securities, but \u201cif Amazon is going to justify its market capitalization, it is going to have to show that other categories are viable on the Internet. So far, they have not shown that sales of other merchandise can grow rapidly and be profitable.\u201d 2005 A decade into its operations, Amazon had already upended the bookselling industry. But as it diversified into a retailer of all manner of products, the reporter Gary Rivlin wrote, some worried that the company  was spreading   itself too thin . And there were concerns, he said, about \u201ca chronic Amazon sticking point: profitability.\u201d The editor of an industry newsletter even questioned Mr. Bezos\u2019s suitability as chief executive. \u201cThe question that needs to be asked,\u201d he said, \u201cis how many years of declining stock performance will a board tolerate before they finally say, \u2018Listen, we need to make a change.\u2019\u201d 2011 As the stock market bounced back after the depths of the financial crisis, Amazon shares began their own steep climb. But as the columnist James B. Stewart noted in 2011, Amazon\u2019s  short-term results periodically seemed to   disappoint investors   who did not share Mr. Bezos\u2019s professed focus on the long term. \u201cNearly 15 years after Amazon\u2019s public offering, it\u2019s safe to say that Mr. Bezos and his colleagues have realized their goal of creating a company to tell their grandchildren about,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut one of these days Amazon has to deliver on its promise of higher margins and profits, however long term that may turn out to be.\u201d 2013 This month came Mr. Bezos\u2019s unexpected  move to purchase The Washington Post . Noting that there would be  no   quick fixes or short-term answers   to The Post\u2019s challenges, the reporters Jenna Wortham and Amy O\u2019Leary said of the Amazon chief: \u201cWhile terms like disrupter and innovator are often used to describe Mr. Bezos in his years at Amazon, he has also proved to be a long-term thinker, someone willing to buck Wall Street demands for big profits in order to invest in his company\u2019s growth.\u201d Tech Sector Responds to Bezos Deal for The  Post Daily Report: Tech Mogul in Deal for a Landmark in the Capital Daily Report: For Washington Post, a Promise of Innovation Daily Report: Amazon Runs Up Against Germany\u2019s Labor  Culture U.S. Proposes Solutions for Apple\u2019s E-Book  Price-Fixing Jeff Bezos heading to a conference in New York in 1998. | Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times | Jeff Bezos heading to a conference in New York in 1998. | Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times",

        "name": "A question of strategy, not content; Econoclast ",
        "content": " It has now been more than a week since Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, announced that he was buying The Washington Post in what could be the most exciting case of convergence between new media and old since the merger of AOL with Time Warner. But how might Mr. Bezos change this venerable flagship of U.S. journalism? And what could his ownership of The Post mean for news businesses around the world? These may seem strange questions for a column devoted mostly to controversies in public policy and economics, but newspapers today are a declining industry, comparable to the steel and shipbuilding industries in the 1980s. Public discussion often assumes that journalism is technologically doomed. The Internet, it seems, is ineluctably turning news and analysis from an industry that employs many into an unpaid hobby for philanthropists or self-promoters who earn their livings by other means. From an economic standpoint, this fatalism is unjustified. If high-quality news and analysis have significant value to customers, then the people providing these services will eventually find ways to get paid. It is often claimed that the news has become worthless because Internet distribution involves zero marginal cost, but this is poor economics. The true cost of news lies not in distribution, but in the research, composition, selection and editing required for good writing. These costs are as high as ever today. The real challenge to newspapers, therefore, is not the idealistic Internet clich\u00e9 that \u2018\u2018information wants to be free.\u2019\u2019 It is the failure of traditional media companies to devise business models that turn the new distribution technology to their advantage. Historically, such failure is not surprising. Just as the railroad companies failed to adapt to cars and competed themselves into bankruptcy, traditional media moguls have proved clueless in harnessing the Internet. This is why the news businesses must look for salvation to managers like Mr. Bezos, who treat the Internet neither as a curse nor as a libertarian utopia, but rather as a very efficient mechanism for getting consumers to spend money. So far, Mr. Bezos has said little about his plans for The Post. The few hints he offered in an open letter to editorial staff had the familiar na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the news proprietor who thinks he can reinvent journalism: \u2018\u2018Our touchstone will be readers, understanding what they care about \u2014 government, local leaders, restaurant openings, scout troops, businesses, charities, governors, sports \u2014 and working backwards from there.\u2019\u2019 As if that were not what newspapers have always done. The question Mr. Bezos ought to be asking is not how to reinvent journalism, but how to make journalism pay in the Internet world. The business model, not the content, is where Mr. Bezos needs to apply his formidable business acumen and intellectual powers. If he does this, he will surely come up with the obvious answer: If you want to make a profit from selling news, you must charge consumers its cost of production plus a profit margin. Traditional U.S. media executives fail to understand this elementary business principle because newspaper costs there have traditionally been subsidized by advertising. The essential economic problem of the news business is that on the Internet, this subsidy disappears, because search-based classified advertising is infinitely more effective than display ads that push unsolicited messages at readers, whether in print papers or on news Web sites. The survival of the news media, therefore, will depend on charging consumers directly for what they read. Unfortunately as they start to do this, traditional media companies are again stampeding in the wrong direction: toward a sole focus on subscriptions that demand annual payments from regular readers. This subscription model is almost as inimical to the Internet as the advertising model, since it tries to recreate the traditional local newspaper model of serving relatively small numbers of \u2018\u2018loyal\u2019\u2019 readers, instead of the millions or even billions of casual users who can be reached via the Net. Much Internet reading will always be casual rather than loyal, as nobody will buy annual subscriptions for more than a few Web sites \u2014 perhaps a local paper, plus a global source like The New York Times, plus a weekly magazine. Yet thousands of sites will occasionally feature items of interest to millions of readers, who could be turned into profitable customers. If, say, 20 million occasional readers spend as little as $1 a year on a Web site, this will create twice as much revenue as 100,000 subscribers paying $100 each. The business objective must surely be to secure both revenue streams \u2014 and this is where Amazon\u2019s success in managing large numbers of small transactions could come in. As co-founder of thebrowser.com, a Web site that aggregates high-quality writing and experiments with payment systems, I am all too aware that conventional wisdom views micropayments as doomed to failure. According to most Internet gurus, readers will always demand free content and find it in abundance. But this consensus is being disproved by events. More and more newspapers are erecting pay walls and demanding subscriptions, eliminating free content. Meanwhile, consumer resistance to Internet payments is disappearing as traffic moves to mobile devices, where data downloads are far from free. The confluence of these two trends creates the right environment for Web sites to levy micropayments for high-quality online content. With consumers now paying hundreds of dollars annually for Internet downloads, newspapers are crazy to cede all this revenue to telecommunications companies while offering their content free to nonsubscribers or completely locking them out. What newspapers need are easy, frictionless mechanisms for charging their casual readers small amounts. Mr. Bezos and Amazon could provide this \u2014 and if they do not, somebody else will.",

        "name": "Internet benefactors help bookshops weather tough times ",
        "content": " For years, independent bookstores in the United States have taken creative steps to fight off challenges from Amazon.com and the superstores by building in-house espresso bars, offering members-only lunches with authors and selling birthday cards, toys and trinkets. In 2013, it has come to this: Asking their customers for donations. Crowdfunding is sweeping through the bookstore business, the latest tactic for survival in a market that is dominated by Amazon, with its rock-bottom prices, and Barnes & Noble, with its dizzying in-store selection. It is hardly a sustainable business model, but it buys some time and gives customers a feeling of helping a favorite cause and even preserving a civic treasure. In San Francisco, a campaign for Adobe Books successfully raised $60,000 on Indiegogo.com in March after the store faced a rent increase and nearly went out of business. In Asheville, North Carolina, the Spellbound Children\u2019s Bookshop collected more than $5,000 when it appealed to customers for help in moving to a new location. In New York, Books of Wonder raised more than $50,000 in an online campaign last autumn after the recession and various losses depleted its resources. Web sites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, originally made for the public financing of creative projects, have simplified the logistics of raising money, and bookstores facing financial distress are seizing the opportunity. A store can set up a Web page explaining what its fund-raising goal is, why it is asking for money and what the deadline is. Donors pitch in as little as $5 or $10 with a few clicks and a credit card number. Peter Glassman, who owns Books of Wonder, said he had turned to a fund-raising campaign only as a last resort. \u2018\u2018I thought, given the financial strains we\u2019re under at the moment, perhaps this is the way to prevent us from getting into a really desperate situation,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Glassman said. He said it was the first time in 30 years that he had been willing to admit that the store needed help. \u2018\u2018You never tell people your problems,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018The worst you say is, \u2018Business is a little tight.\u2019\u2019\u2019 But that kind of tough-it-out attitude seems to have gone the way of the Book-of-the-Month Club. The independent bookstores that remain have taken a hard-nosed approach to their business, more willing to experiment with new technologies and to tap the carefully cultivated loyalty of their customers. Josh Mills, the longtime manager of The Bookstore in Chico, California, made a public appeal for $35,000 on Indiegogo when the owner decided to close the store and Mr. Mills stepped up to buy it. In less than two months, he and his wife, Muir Hughes, had collected $36,068, mostly in chunks of $15 and $25 from locals who were outraged at the thought of the bookstore\u2019s shutting down. Donations seemed to come from everywhere: Mr. Mills received $25 from one former customer in Hawaii who had heard about the store\u2019s plight via e-mail from a friend in France. Acquaintances threw local fund-raisers, serving wine, crostini and deviled eggs, and then funneled the money into the online campaign. \u2018\u2018I felt strange about asking for money that way \u2014 baring my soul and sharing my personal business is not what I do,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Mills, who now owns the store. \u2018\u2018Bookstores are sort of an endangered industry for lots of reasons. But it would have left a huge hole in our little community if we had gone away.\u2019\u2019 Independents\u2019 business has suffered in recent years for all of the usual reasons. Many customers have shifted their purchases from print books to e-books. Amazon\u2019s market share keeps growing, making it the biggest seller of books in the country. And the price of rent has gone up in city centers. A price war between Amazon and Overstock.com, another online retailer, that flared up last month resulted in a discounting of print books even more steeply than usual, sometimes close to 60 percent \u2014 a price cut that a small bookstore cannot match. (Amazon and Overstock can make up for their losses on books by selling jewelry, furniture and diapers.) But owners of independent bookstores also reason that if they cannot compete with Amazon on price, they will attract customers by having a more carefully chosen selection. If Barnes & Noble has uninformed salesclerks, theirs will have the fluency of a doctorate candidate in literature. If their customers have a fierce attachment to their local neighborhood bookstore, as many claim to do, then bookstore owners say that they should test that loyalty by making a direct appeal for donations. \u2018\u2018I think it\u2019s an indication of the emotional connection that many customers have with their bookstores,\u2019\u2019 said Daniel Goldin, the owner of the Boswell Book Company in Milwaukee. \u2018\u2018Every customer who buys a book at an independent could do it in a different way, a cheaper way. A lot of customers position us in their head like the nonprofits they support, like a humane society or a park.\u2019\u2019 The American Booksellers Association, a trade group, says the number of bookstores it represents has grown slightly in the past several years, despite an overall drop in the past decade \u2014 it has 1,632 members, down from about 2,400 members in 2002. \u2018\u2018Amazon obviously continues to grow,\u2019\u2019 said Oren Teicher, the chief executive of the association. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not like we\u2019re without challenges.\u2019\u2019 Seeking financial support from customers, he said, is an example \u2018\u2018of how a combination of technology and localism is helping stores get funded that 20 years ago would have been impossible to do.\u2019\u2019 Many independent bookstores said that despite the challenges to their business, they were doing just fine. Some of them are crowdfunding not as a means of survival, but as a way to expand. BookCourt, a fixture in the Cobble Hill neighborhood in the Brooklyn borough of New York, has been thriving despite competition from Amazon and Barnes & Noble \u2014 a two-story Barnes & Noble is just three blocks away. It recently started an ambitious online campaign to help pay for the purchase of a new bookstore space in the Catskill Mountains that will open next spring. Zack Zook, the events and development director for the store, said he had been inspired by online fund-raising campaigns for short films and art projects that he had occasionally participated in for the past several years. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s something that feels really neutral about throwing a hundred bucks in a pot,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Zook said. \u2018\u2018People like to be affiliated with a mission. And with any independent bookstore, it\u2019s almost like a nonprofit \u2014 there\u2019s really no money to play with.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Glassman, of Books of Wonder, said he had been gratified by the support. \u2018\u2018It was very touching to know how much people care,\u2019\u2019 he said. He acknowledged the fund-raising campaign was a short-term fix. \u2018\u2018It helped, but it didn\u2019t solve it,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018But we\u2019re not in danger anymore of closing tomorrow.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " Last month the Justice Department won an antitrust suit against Apple, convincing Judge Denise Cote of United States District Court that the company had colluded with five major publishers to fix e-book prices. At a hearing on Friday, the department will argue that its plan to remedy Apple's misconduct will ''restore lost competition.'' In a narrow sense it may, but the problem with this case all along was that the department ignored the potentially bigger anticompetitive force in the e-book market -- Amazon -- while focusing on Apple. Apple's wrongdoing dates back to 2010, when it introduced an ''agency model'' in which publishers set retail prices and Apple took a commission. The company also specified in its contracts that if a rival set lower prices than those in the iBookstore, the publishers would have to match them. After these deals, e-book prices went up. The Justice Department charged Apple with illegally conspiring to fix prices. As reparation, the Justice Department wants Apple to terminate its contracts with the five publishers. The government also wants to ban Apple from signing agreements with suppliers of e-books, music, movies and television shows that are likely to increase the prices at which rivals sell that content. It wants the company to pay for a court-appointed monitor to ensure compliance with antitrust law, and allow other retailers (like Amazon and Barnes & Noble) to sell e-books from their iPad and iPhone apps for a two-year period, without paying Apple a commission on those sales. What's in this for consumers? E-book prices, which spiked in 2010, dropped back down in 2012, after publishers started settling with the government. The proposed remedies should prevent future price-fixing and make it easier for readers to make purchases through apps. Mainly, the Justice Department's plan will keep Apple from getting back to its old tricks. It does not address the need for a counterweight to Amazon's dominance. Amazon controls an estimated 65 percent of the market, with Apple at 10 percent and other retailers splitting the rest. (Before Apple started selling e-books, Amazon had 90 percent.) The case against Apple has done nothing to solve that problem.",

''Is there a Kindle edition available,'' asked one reviewer of Monet's 1868 portrait of his son Jean. ''Pros'' include ''Looks good above my toilet'' and ''Fast shipping,'' another wrote. ''Cons: Frame and painting looked used.'' ''I think I'm going to touch this up a bit with some water colors I have laying around,'' the reviewer added. ''Make the colors pop more.'' Erik Fairleigh, an Amazon spokesman, declined to say just how many of the site's visitors have actually bought anything since the company the site opened on Tuesday morning, but he said: ''We are pleased with the early sales.'' He added:, ''We are thrilled with the strong customer response to the new Fine Art store.'' Could he be referring to a comment on another Monet, ''Fragment de Nymph\u00e9as'' for $2.5 million: '' The best part is that since I'm a prime member, I saved about 20 bucks on shipping.'' Or one on a Warhol screen print of a Campbell's Golden Mushroom Soup can for just under $25,000, that directed other customers to the grocery section and noted: ''This version is a much better price, and is delicious.'' Of course, the art marketplace still has a ways to go before it can match the more than 4,300 reviews that the banana slicer has elicited over six years, including those with practical advice: ''Once I figured out I had to peel the banana before using -- it works much better.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. (PHOTOGRAPH BY AMAZON.COM)",

What, many are asking, does Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, see in a 135-year-old newspaper that others do not? If his business history is any indication, do not expect a quick answer and do not expect any short-term fixes for The Post, which has suffered from years of sliding revenue and circulation. While terms like disrupter and innovator are often used to describe Mr. Bezos in his years at Amazon, he has also proved to be a long-term thinker, someone willing to buck Wall Street demands for big profits in order to invest in his company\u2019s growth. Now that he is the private owner of The Post, it would not be surprising to see him worry little about turning a quick profit and instead push to upend the often ossified world of newspaper publishing, just as he did with books more than a decade ago. Indeed, Mr. Bezos, who declined a request for an interview, hinted in a letter to employees that he felt a \u2018\u2018need to invent, which means we will need to experiment,\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018there will, of course, be change at The Post over the coming years.\u2019\u2019 But just what those experiments will be is anyone\u2019s guess. \u2018\u2018Jeff Bezos doesn\u2019t need The Washington Post to make money tomorrow or even in five years,\u2019\u2019 said Glenn Kelman, the founder and chief executive of Redfin, a real estate site that, like Amazon, is based in Seattle. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s proven that he\u2019s able to think over a geological time scale.\u2019\u2019 In recent years, newspapers large and small have experimented with concepts aimed at capturing elusive online revenue to make up for losses in print circulation and advertising. The Post, for example, has dabbled in some experimental news products, including the creation of a social reader for Facebook and a recommendation engine called Trove. Other news organizations have toyed with various strategies, most with limited success. The Daily, an iPad-only news app developed by News Corp., was closed after less than two years. The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, The New York Times and The Post have adopted various pay models for digital readers. The Guardian started a U.S.-based operation in 2011 to experiment with a digitally focused newsroom. All of these companies have created mobile apps and made significant investments in online video, where advertising revenue is expected to grow, but no paper has cracked the code on how to replace the steep declines in print advertising. Other traditional print magazines, like The New Yorker and Vogue, have digitized and sold portions of their archives. They have also dabbled with new ways to make money through Amazon, particularly through the Kindle Singles, which are shorter e-books. Amazon\u2019s biggest influence has been disrupting the economics of newspapers through millions of its Kindle mobile devices. Mr. Bezos said The Post would be run separately from Amazon, but there is little doubt that he will bring what he has learned over the years to the newspaper world. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s done an amazing job of bringing e-books to reality,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Galligan, the co-founder of the mobile news start-up Circa. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a strong likelihood that a similar transition could happen at The Post.\u2019\u2019 Though Mr. Bezos demurely noted in his letter that he had no history in newspapers, the fact that he is an outsider not steeped in the old ways of newspaper management has excited some. \u2018\u2018Washington Post to be sold to Jeff Bezos?! I\u2019d actually return to the journalism world if I could work for him,\u2019\u2019 wrote Adrian Holovaty on Twitter after the news broke. Six years ago, Mr. Holovaty held the title \u2018\u2018editor for editorial innovation\u2019\u2019 at The Post, but he left in 2007. The co-creator of the popular Web framework Django, he thinks Mr. Bezos will bring \u2018\u2018fresh, baggage-less thinking.\u2019\u2019 No baggage \u2014 and deep pockets \u2014 means room to try new things. Might Mr. Bezos apply technology industry concepts like frictionless payments, e-commerce integration, recommendation engines, data analytics or improved concepts for mobile reading? One of the biggest challenges for any company trying to sell goods on the Web, whether it is a crop-top shirt or a news subscription, is \u2018\u2018creating relevance,\u2019\u2019 said Deena Varshavskaya, the founder and chief executive of Wanelo, an e-commerce site popular with women. That is an area where Mr. Bezos might be primed to flex his expertise in analyzing data to find ways to engage a younger audience. In addition, his money could come in handy when it comes to adding to the newspaper developers, engineers, designers and others who could radically change the way the organization looks and runs. The tech industry from which Mr. Bezos has emerged certainly has offered new ways to consume news. Start-ups like Flipboard, Digg, Pocket and Feedly have long been testing and building out alternative ways to read and consume information on the Web and via mobile devices. That includes experimenting with news aggregation, recommendations and clever ways to bookmark interesting articles to read later. James M. Brady, who was the executive editor of The Post\u2019s Web site from 2004 to 2008, said that traditional news outlets had struggled to build and experiment with the digital arms of their organizations while retaining the values that built the company. \u2018\u2018We all tried to do it on the news side, but when you\u2019re dealing with declining revenues and still trying to put out a daily news product, there\u2019s not much money left for the developer side,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018We should have done it anyway, but at the time we were trying to preserve the core product, the daily newspaper.\u2019\u2019 In other words, the new ownership is an opportunity for a tech-oriented reboot. Mr. Kelman of Redfin said that the steady flow of new ideas and the consumer reach of sites like Yahoo, Google, Facebook and Twitter meant that technology had a lot to say about the future of The Post and other newspapers. That a tech mogul is now also a newspaper mogul should not be a shock. \u2018\u2018It used to be that in Silicon Valley we just built the platforms and someone else wrote the content,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018But that is changing. The lines have been blurred for a long time and this is just another step in that process.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " A day after the news that Amazon's founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is buying The Washington Post, his company officially entered another cultural arena: art. On Tuesday, the online retailer announced the start of Amazon Art, where customers can buy original and limited-edition art from more than 150 dealers and 4,500 artists, ranging in price from a $10 screen print by the up-and-comer Ryan Humphrey to a $4.85 million painting by Norman Rockwell. Amazon, which worked with Sotheby's for a short-lived experiment selling art on the Web in 1999, will now vie with other, more established competitors in the online marketplace, including Artsy and Artnet. Amazon has sought to blunt some of that competitive pressure by partnering with Paddle8, an online auction site, among other players. ''Amazon Art gives galleries a way to bring their passion and expertise about the artists they represent to our millions of customers,'' said Peter Faricy, the company's vice president for the Amazon Marketplace. Erik Fairleigh, an Amazon spokesman, said that the commission scale is similar to what other sellers that use Amazon pay: between 5 and 20 percent, depending on the price of the artwork. Amazon is not providing an ironclad guarantee of authenticity, but Mr. Fairleigh said that the company is ''working with prestigious galleries and dealers'' to ensure quality and would investigate any potential problems and ''take appropriate action.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. (PHOTOGRAPH BY MELVIN SOKOLSKY)",

        "content": " Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, is worth $28 billion,  Forbes estimates . In other words, he\u2019s good for the $250 million he\u2019s spending personally to  buy The Washington Post , even if the purchase, announced this week, is being described as  making little financial sense . Maybe he was on to something 14 years ago, when, as Peter de Jonge  wrote in an entertaining and still relevant   cover story for the magazine , Bezos and his company were fostering a \u201cforced and incongruous indifference to money\u201d among Amazon\u2019s work force. They had lots of morale-boosting mottos but a volatile stock price. (When de Jonge expressed skepticism about the company, one Amazon executive told him, \u201cI can tell you\u2019re not a believer.\u201d) De Jonge imagined that being employed there must have been \u201ca little like living in Pompeii 2,000 years ago.\u201d But apparently all those years of not-profit-making paid off. We went back to de Jonge\u2019s article looking for any insights into the character who will be taking over one of the country\u2019s best-known newspapers. This passage seemed germane. (The \u201cinvestment\u201d Bezos is referring to was Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Drugstore.com.) Bezos declined to say if he has investments in other e-commerce companies, but says, \u201cWe may do more investments like this.\u201d It\u2019s this kind of almost routine doubling down every few months of his already massive bet and nervy expansion of the scale of his ambitions that keeps the public and Wall Street on the edge of their seats, makes Bezos a moving target to his rivals and buys him more time to turn a profit. And as he encourages us to imbue his company with the same limitless potential that as a rule we only vouchsafe for ourselves, we have to keep revising upward and outward our best guess of just what Bezos is really after. Does he want to be the reincarnation of Sam Walton? Does he want to be Michael Eisner? . . . Bezos, who once told his younger brother that he \u201crefuses to evaluate either-or equations,\u201d most likely wants to be all of these and then some. Indeed, his every gesture, posture and feature, from his standard-issue wardrobe of khakis and brown rubber-soled shoes to his homemade desk fashioned out of a door, seems calculated to belie the incendiary fact that Bezos is one of the world\u2019s most ascendant capitalists, with apparently boundless ambitions. Today de Jonge says he recalls being \u201cvery impressed by the guy.\u201d After writing the article, he wanted to buy stock in Amazon. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says, he \u201cnever got around to it.\u201d Let\u2019s Help Michele  Bachmann Stock Advice for These Uncertain Times My (Legal) Editor\u2019s Dream",

        "name": "Amazon chief\u2019s new Capitol megaphone; Deal for Washington Post builds bridge between technology and politics ",
        "content": " The Washington of Jeffrey P. Bezos has been the state on the West Coast, a place of disruptive technology, fleece jackets and software engineers. He has shown little interest in the city on the East Coast, the Washington of politics, power suits and Woodward and Bernstein. Yet now, from his tech frontier in Seattle, Mr. Bezos has bridged those worlds by buying The Washington Post. The purchase price of $250 million is a pittance for a man who ranked 19th on Forbes magazine\u2019s list of billionaires, with an estimated fortune of more than $25 billion. But the deal was still an astonishing move for a magnate who has kept a low profile in politics and has said almost nothing about his interest in newspapers, except that he reads them. Nonetheless, Mr. Bezos will now have a megaphone in the capital as powerful as anyone\u2019s except in the White House. In keeping with many of his tech industry peers, he brings with him a libertarian bent, having supported gay marriage in Washington State and fought higher income taxes on wealthy people. \u2018\u2018Of the businesspeople I know, he and Bill Gates are the two most intellectually curious people I know,\u2019\u2019 said Rob Glaser, the founder of another Seattle technology company, RealNetworks, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s. \u2018\u2018It doesn\u2019t surprise me that Jeff would find something with the intellectual depth of The Post an intriguing, compelling thing to be involved with.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos, 49, said in a statement on Monday that he would leave the day-to-day operations at The Washington Post to others. But his history \u2014 rising quickly as a Wall Street whiz, then starting Amazon.com out of a garage and building it into a retailing giant \u2014 is chock-full of cold calculations to improve his company\u2019s fortunes. Many of his decisions have panned out, as Amazon has muscled its way into nearly every corner of retailing, leaving many competitors chafing in his wake. The purchase of The Washington Post fits into one of the more eclectic \u2014 some might say, eccentric \u2014 patterns of investing and charitable giving of today\u2019s billionaires. On top of the usual ream of stakes in technology start-ups like Uber and Twitter, Mr. Bezos has indulged his passion for outer space by financing the recovery from the seabed of an Apollo rocket that carried the first humans to the moon. He is paying for the creation of a clock buried in a mountain in West Texas that will tick once a year for the next 10,000 years. And now, Mr. Bezos \u2014 a man known for being an unsentimental business executive \u2014 has invested squarely in a sentimental business steeped in tradition. Of course, the deal for The Washington Post could feed his demonstrated appetite for reinventing venerable industries, from retailing to book publishing. Amazon\u2019s Kindle business has turned Mr. Bezos from a merchant into a media mogul, as celebrated in some circles as another digital disrupter, Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s former chief executive. Mr. Bezos and Donald E. Graham, chief executive of The Washington Post Co., have longstanding connections that may have helped the discussions. As an article on The Post\u2019s Web site noted, Mr. Graham gave the Amazon chief advice on how to promote newspapers on the Kindle device. And Amazon is an investor in LivingSocial, an e-commerce venture led by Tim O\u2019Shaughnessy, Mr. Graham\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Bezos has provided few clues about what changes might be in store. In an interview last year, though, he stated that he did not think people reading the Web would pay for a newspaper subscription because they were too trained to get it free. The Washington Post started an online subscription plan this year. He said in the same interview that there would be no printed newspapers in 20 years. The Washington Post had more than 457,000 subscribers to its daily print issue in the first quarter of this year. This year, Mr. Bezos was one of a group that put $5 million into Business Insider, a news site founded by Henry Blodget. Mr. Blodget rose to fame as a Wall Street analyst in the late 1990s with a wild forecast for Amazon\u2019s shares that came true. Drew Herdener, a spokesman for Amazon, who works with the Amazon chief on his personal initiatives, said Mr. Bezos was not available for an interview. As Amazon has grown, so too has the volume of criticism of the company. It controls at least a quarter of the book business, more than any company in the past. Critics say that concentration is unhealthy. Mr. Bezos\u2019 disinclination to collect sales tax led him to investigate setting up Amazon on an Indian reservation. The company stoutly resisted efforts in many states over the years to get it to collect the taxes, saying it preferred a national solution. A tax reform measure mandating the collection of taxes by Internet companies has passed the Senate but is stalled in the House of Representatives. Critics of Amazon were aghast at the news of the purchase, saying it would further increase the power of a company and a tycoon they think already have too much of it. Although Mr. Bezos and not Amazon bought The Post, rivals and critics were already concerned that the newspaper\u2019s work would be used to help Amazon. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s an old, boring story \u2014 rich man buys a newspaper \u2014 but in this instance it\u2019s one of the richest men ever buying one of the most important newspapers ever, which is the one our government leaders read first thing every morning,\u2019\u2019 said Dennis Johnson, the co-founder of Melville House, a well-regarded small publisher. \u2018\u2018This is the capper in the development of one of the most powerful vertical monopolies in our history, which is also one of the most controlling in matters of cultural concern.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bezos was a tinkerer from an early age. After Princeton University in New Jersey, he went to Wall Street, ending up at D.E. Shaw & Co., a hedge fund. He began Amazon when he took note of two things: how fast the Internet was growing as it became a consumer medium in the early 1990s, and how well-suited the book business was to selling online. One Web site could offer all the hundreds of thousands of titles in print in a way that a land-based store never could. As Amazon grew big, Mr. Bezos largely shunned the media spotlight. He has mostly shunned the political spotlight as well. His political contributions have gone mostly to Amazon\u2019s corporate PAC, which divides its campaign checks relatively evenly between Democratic and Republican candidates. The stepson of a Cuban immigrant, Mr. Bezos has stayed out of the immigration debate that has attracted so many luminaries from the technology business. Last year, Mr. Bezos and his wife made waves with a $2.5 million contribution to the successful campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington State. He was one of the biggest donors in 2010 to another winning effort to defeat a proposed income tax on the wealthy in Washington State. People who know Mr. Bezos describe his political views as libertarian, with a small \u2018\u2018l.\u2019\u2019 On Monday, Mr. Bezos told Washington Post employees that he did not intend to leave his full-time Amazon duties, or to relocate.",

        "content": " In the United States, technology giants like Amazon.com are often celebrated as fonts of innovation and jobs. But across the Atlantic \u2014 nein, non, no. Even as President Barack Obama spoke about middle-class jobs last week at an Amazon warehouse in Tennessee, Amazon was facing strikes at warehouses in Germany, its second-biggest market. Unions there say the company has imported American-style business practices \u2014 in particular, an antipathy toward organized labor \u2014 that stand at odds with European norms. \u2018\u2018In Germany, the idea that warehouse workers are going to be getting opposition from an employer when it comes to the right to organize, that\u2019s virtually unheard-of,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Courtney, a technology and communications department head at Uni Global Union, a federation of trade unions based in Nyon, Switzerland. \u2018\u2018It puts Amazon out in left field.\u2019\u2019 Amazon is hardly out there alone, however. Large American technology companies are increasingly running into obstacles as they expand in Europe. For Facebook and Google, the running issue is privacy. Google was fined this year by the German authorities for illegally collecting personal data while creating its Street View mapping service, after facing minimal sanctions over Street View at home. Meanwhile, European privacy regulators are considering tough regulations to protect consumers on the Internet, a direct challenge to Google, Facebook and other online companies that mine personal data. Antitrust officials in Europe are scrutinizing Apple\u2019s relationships with wireless carriers, as well as Google\u2019s competitive practices. And Google, Apple and Amazon have all been criticized by European lawmakers for tactics that help them minimize their tax bills. Amazon has been criticized for its working conditions in the United States, but not nearly to the same extent as in Europe. On the surface, Amazon\u2019s labor problems in Germany revolve around wages. The union says workers in warehouses in two small German cities are properly classified as retail employees and should be paid at the higher rate required for people who work in department stores and other retail outlets. Amazon says they are more properly classified as warehouse workers, and paid at a lower rate. The subtext, though, is Amazon\u2019s opposition to unions in its warehouses as a general principle, because the company fears unions will slow down the kind of behind-the-scenes innovation that has propelled its growth. Dave Clark, the company\u2019s vice president of worldwide operations and customer service, says Amazon views unions as intermediaries that will want to have a say on issues as varied as employee scheduling and the handling and packaging of orders. Amazon prizes its ability to introduce changes in such areas into its warehouses quickly to improve the experience of its customers, he said. Last year, the company spent $775 million to buy a manufacturer of robots that it plans eventually to deploy in its warehouses, though it has not said when they would come to Germany. The last thing it wants is to have to get approval from unions for such changes. \u2018\u2018This really isn\u2019t about higher wages,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Clark said. \u2018\u2018It isn\u2019t a cost question for us. It\u2019s about what our relationship is with our people.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018We\u2019re still a developing industry,\u2019\u2019 he added \u2014 despite the fact that Amazon posted revenue of $15.7 billion in the past quarter and the company is enjoying a buoyant stock price. In the United States, Amazon has successfully thwarted efforts to unionize. More than a decade ago, Mr. Courtney of Uni Global led an unsuccessful effort in the company\u2019s home state of Washington to organize Amazon\u2019s customer service representatives. Two years ago, an investigative article by The Morning Call newspaper in Pennsylvania\u2019s Lehigh Valley chronicled poor working conditions in an Amazon warehouse in the state, including instances in which it had stationed paramedics outside to take heat-stressed workers to the emergency room. Amazon says it has addressed the problem by installing air-conditioning in all of its facilities. More recently, a firm that provides temporary employees for Amazon warehouses is defending itself in a class-action suit that claims the firm shortchanged workers on pay as they waited in security lines to leave warehouses. Jonathan Barnes, a spokesman for the staffing firm named in the suit, Integrity Staffing Solutions, declined to comment. But it is a different story in Germany, where the powerful labor movement behind the Amazon strikes traces its roots for more than two centuries. Mr. Courtney, the Swiss-based head of the federation of trade unions, said other American technology giants, including I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard, have been more tolerant than Amazon of unions in their European operations. And the strikes in Germany raise especially knotty problems for the company, which has ambitious expansion plans there. Germany is Amazon\u2019s second-biggest market after North America, accounting for $8.73 billion, or 14 percent, of total company revenue in 2012. Even as workers in Bad Hersfeld and Leipzig began their recent strikes, Amazon announced plans to open a ninth logistics center in Germany, in the former East German state of Brandenburg, west of Berlin. The strike was organized by the powerful service workers union ver.di, which has about 2.3 million members across Germany, and a sizable war chest to pay striking workers. Thomas Schneider, ver.di\u2019s point man for organizing the strike at the Leipzig plant, argued that Amazon\u2019s tactics, along with its refusal even to enter into talks with the unions, had created an image of being against its own work force that could hurt it in the long run. \u2018\u2018When it is put under pressure, Amazon reacts,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Schneider said. The company says that after a year, its German workers make more money on average than those in similar businesses. And it says it has complied with German labor laws by allowing worker councils at its warehouses. But these councils are legally forbidden from getting involved in wage deals, which is why the union wants to get involved. In Germany, Mr. Clark of Amazon said, the strikes have not disrupted its business because the number of workers who have walked out has been relatively small. When necessary, the company has been able to shift orders to other facilities that are not striking, he said. The union, though, credits the strikes with recent improvements to overtime scheduling, an increase in the number of break rooms and a pledge by Amazon to pay Christmas bonuses, a standard practice in German industry. At a strike in June with hundreds of workers who gathered outside the gates of the Leipzig plant, the head of ver.di, Frank Bsirske, played on Amazon\u2019s motto of \u2018\u2018Work hard. Have fun. Make history,\u2019\u2019 telling the strikers they should take it to heart. \u2018\u2018You are making history by striking,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bsirske told the crowd to cheers and whistles. \u2018\u2018You are making history by demanding higher wages. We are not going to let a big American company come here and play Wild West. This is a clash of cultures.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "Amazon's Founder to Buy The Washington Post ",
        "content": " CORRECTION APPENDEDThe Washington Post, the newspaper whose reporting helped topple a president and inspired a generation of journalists, is being sold for $250 million to the founder of Amazon.com, Jeffrey P. Bezos, in a deal that has shocked the industry. Donald E. Graham, chairman and chief executive of The Washington Post Company, and the third generation of the Graham family to lead the paper, told the staff about the sale late Monday afternoon. They had gathered together in the newspaper's auditorium at the behest of the publisher, Katharine Weymouth, his niece. ''I, along with Katharine Weymouth and our board of directors, decided to sell only after years of familiar newspaper-industry challenges made us wonder if there might be another owner who would be better for the Post (after a transaction that would be in the best interest of our shareholders),'' Mr. Graham said in a written statement. In the auditorium, he closed his remarks by saying that nobody in the room should be sad -- except, he said, ''for me.'' The announcement was greeted by what many staff members described as ''shock,'' a reaction shared in newsrooms across the country as one of the crown jewels of newspapers was surrendered by one of the industry's royal families. In Mr. Bezos, The Post will have a very different owner, a technologist whose fortunes have risen in the last dozen years even as those of The Post and most newspapers have struggled. Through Amazon, the retailing giant, he has helped revolutionize the way people around the world consume -- first books, then expanding to all kinds of goods and more recently in online storage, electronic books and online video, including a recent spate of original programming. In the meeting, Mr. Graham stressed that Mr. Bezos would purchase The Post in a personal capacity and not on behalf of Amazon the company. The $250 million deal includes all of the publishing businesses owned by The Washington Post Company, including the Express newspaper, The Gazette Newspapers, Southern Maryland Newspapers, Fairfax County Times, El Tiempo Latino and Greater Washington Publishing. The Washington Post company plans to hold on to Slate magazine, The Root.com and Foreign Policy. According to the release, Mr. Bezos has asked Ms. Weymouth to remain at The Post along with Stephen P. Hills, president and general manager; Martin Baron, executive editor; and Fred Hiatt, editor of the editorial page. Mr. Bezos, who did not attend the meeting at The Post on Monday, said in a statement that he had known Mr. Graham for the past decade and said about Mr. Graham that ''I do not know a finer man.'' Ms. Weymouth said that in negotiating this deal, Mr. Bezos made it clear he was not purely focused on profits. The sale, at a price that would have been unthinkably low even a few years ago, represents the end of eight decades of ownership by the Graham family of The Post since Eugene Meyer bought The Post at auction on June 1, 1933. His son-in-law Philip L. Graham served as president of the paper from 1947 until his death in 1963. Then Graham's widow, Katharine Graham, oversaw the paper through the publication of the Pentagon Papers alongside The New York Times and its coverage of Watergate, the political scandal that led to the resignation of Richard Nixon and also a starring role for the newspaper in the film, ''All The President's Men.'' The Post's daily circulation peaked in 1993 at 832,332, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. But like most newspapers, it has suffered greatly from circulation and advertising declines. By March, the newspaper's daily circulation had dropped to 474,767. The company became pressed enough for cash that Ms. Weymouth announced in February that it was looking to sell its flagship headquarters. According to a regulatory filing associated with the sale, Mr. Bezos will pay rent to The Post Company on the space for up to three years. As of 2012, the newsroom, which once had more than 1,000 employees, had fewer than 640. People there on Monday described the mood as ''somber'' with ''a lot of people kind of in disbelief.'' In an interview in July, Mr. Graham was cagey about the family's future in the business. ''I'll just fall back on the same answer,'' he said, adding, ''In family companies you have judgments about the family and you have professional judgment. The family control of The Washington Post Company over the years, I think, has been a healthy thing.'' In an e-mail Monday, Ms. Weymouth, who replaced her uncle as publisher in 2008, talked about the effect of the sale on her family: ''Yes -- we knew the sale was coming. This was a process that was months in the making. It is, of course, sad for the family -- we have been incredibly honored to have been a part of The Post for the past 80, but we have always understood that this is a public trust and our focus was on ensuring that it would remain strong for generations of readers to come.'' The Post is not the only newspaper to move to new ownership. The New York Times Company announced early Saturday morning that it had sold its New England Media Group, which includes The Boston Globe, for $70 million, a fraction of the $1.1 billion the Times company paid for just The Globe in 1993. Ken Doctor, an analyst at Outsell, said that the Post sale reflected a broader trend of newspaper ownership returning to local investors rather than large, publicly traded enterprises. ''Newspapers are not really much creatures of the marketplace anymore,'' said Mr. Doctor. ''They're not throwing off much in profits. They need shelter from the pressure of quarterly financial statements and reports.'' Newspaper analysts also said that the sale seems to be good news for the future of The Post. Alan D. Mutter, a newspaper consultant who writes the blog Reflections of a Newsosaur, said that for the first time someone with a native digital background was purchasing a major newspaper rather than an old-time businessman who would try to restore The Post to its earlier heyday and treat it ''like 1953 Plymouths in Cuba.'' While Mr. Bezos may be purchasing The Post separate from Amazon, Mr. Mutter predicted that there could be collaborations between the brands, like The Post's content appearing on every Kindle or Post video content appearing on Amazon. ''This is a guy who literally has invested in building rockets because he thinks it's a good idea. I believe he's bought the newspaper because he wants to re-envision the enterprise and The Post is an iconic world brand,'' said Mr. Mutter about Mr. Bezos. ''He knows something about building iconic world brands.'' Shortly after the announcement, Leonard Downie, the Post's former executive editor, sat down at the Caribou Coffee store down the block from the newsroom he once led and contemplated a future where the Grahams no longer own the newspaper. Mr. Graham had called Mr. Downie, now a vice president at The Post Company, earlier in the day. ''I was completely shocked,'' Mr. Downie said. ''I could hardly say anything.'' Mr. Downie arrived at the paper nearly 50 years ago, and for all of the time since, the Graham family has been at the center of the newspaper -- and more broadly, he said, at the center of journalism in Washington. ''The important thing about the Grahams for me,'' he said, referring to Ben Bradlee, his predecessor as executive editor, ''is that starting with Ben and with me, and I assume my successors, is that the news decisions were always ours, but the Grahams were always behind us.'' Correction: August 13, 2013, Tuesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Tuesday about the sale of The Washington Post to Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, misspelled the given name of the father of Donald E. Graham, chairman and chief executive of The Washington Post Company. His father, who was a publisher of the paper and also president of the company, was Philip L. Graham, not Phillip. Katharine Weymouth, publisher, and Donald E. Graham, chairman and chief executive, represent the third and fourth generations of the Graham family to lead The Washington Post.

        "content": " $250 million. That's all Jeffrey P. Bezos paid on Monday for The Washington Post, which was once worth several billion dollars. $70 million. That's all John Henry paid on Friday for The Boston Globe, a paper The New York Times had acquired for $1.1 billion in 1993. Next to nothing. That's what IBT Media paid to buy Newsweek over the weekend from IAC, which itself had paid only $1 plus $40 million in pension obligations to buy it two years ago. How do you explain the prices that these storied media institutions have been sold for over the last 72 hours? The answer has little to do with dollars and cents, spreadsheets and valuation metrics. If it did, in truth, the buyers might have paid even less. If it wasn't clear that newspapers have become trophies for the wealthy with an interest in journalism or power -- or a combination of both -- it should be now. ''These deals don't make financial sense,'' said Ken Doctor, an analyst at Outsell, a research and consulting firm for the publishing industry. He suggested that Mr. Bezos's valuation of The Washington Post was a generous gift. ''It is a combination of good will and real estate,'' he said, before adding, ''I mean good will in the moral sense, not the financial sense.'' Mr. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon.com, is paying cash for The Washington Post out of his own personal wealth, currently estimated at more than $25 billion. The Post will cost him roughly 1 percent of what he owns in Amazon stock alone. Some billionaires like cars, yachts and private jets. Others like newspapers. ''Newspapers have gone from the public markets to the hands of a relatively few billionaires who have an appetite for social, civic and financial roles,'' Mr. Doctor said. Based on the math, it is hard to justify a $250 million valuation for The Washington Post. The company reported it lost nearly $50 million for the first half of the year on its newspaper operation that generated $138.4 million in revenue. Of the $50 million loss, nearly $40 million was a noncash pension expense. So you could argue that the company lost only $10 million on operations. But it lost $33 million in the first half of 2012, too, also including pension costs. Circulation fell about 7 percent in the first half of 2013. At the end of last year, the company valued its newspaper assets at $293.6 million, no doubt a generous figure. For the Washington Post Company, which will remain publicly traded and renamed, probably to reflect its focus on its education business, Kaplan, and its television stations, the sale of the newspaper represents a very small part of its business. The Washington Post Company's market value is $4.2 billion. But the newspaper, which has been owned by four generations of the family since 1933, was not just a business. Underscoring the size of the newspaper to the company, Katharine Weymouth, publisher of the newspaper, justified the sale by saying this in an interview with The Washington Post: ''If journalism is the mission, given the pressures to cut costs and make profits, maybe (a publicly traded company) is not the best place for The Post.'' By taking the newspaper private, Mr. Bezos can afford to be a patient owner. Profit and loss is probably the least of his concerns. A running joke on Monday was this from Ben Popper, the editor at the Web site the Verge, on Twitter: ''Jeff Bezos has reputation for building great companies with little to no profit, perfect guy to own a newspaper.'' While Mr. Bezos may not be buying the paper for immediate profits, it may not be entirely altruistic either. His parents, Jackie and Mike Bezos, run the Bezos Family Foundation, which is not expected to be involved in the business. As part of the deal, Mr. Bezos is assuming the pension obligations of the current employees of the newspaper. Compared with the deal John Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox, struck for The Boston Globe on Friday, Mr. Bezos looks like a lavish benefactor. Mr. Henry paid $70 million, but The Boston Globe has approximately $110 million in pension obligations, which The New York Times Company is keeping on its books. One billionaire who has been bullish on newspapers, not just as a benefactor, but as a business, is Warren Buffett. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, has acquired a series of newspapers, including The Omaha World-Herald, where he lives and grew up, and more from Media General. In my conversations with him over the last year, he has stressed that he likes small, community newspapers because there is a built-in audience that can't get the news elsewhere. But he has expressed doubts about regional newspapers, like The Los Angeles Times. Berkshire is a major shareholder of the Washington Post Company and Mr. Buffett was on the board for many years, until 2011. At Berkshire's annual meeting, Mr. Buffett said he expected his newspapers to make a profit, but ''it's not going to move the needle at Berkshire.'' On Monday night, just hours after The Post announced its sale to Mr. Bezos, James Fallows, a former editor of U.S. News & World Report who writes for The Atlantic, said the deal put him in a state of shock. ''Let us hope,'' he wrote, ''that this is what the sale signifies: The beginning of a phase in which this Gilded Age's major beneficiaries reinvest in the infrastructure of our public intelligence.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. The Washington Post announced on Monday that Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, was buying the paper.

        "content": " Updated, 4:53 p.m. | In July, the Justice Department won its antitrust lawsuit that accused Apple of conspiring with publishers to raise the prices of e-books. Now, the government wants to use its victory to discipline Apple in other markets where it does business, like movies, music and television shows. The Justice Department on Friday proposed guidelines to the United States District Court in Lower Manhattan on how to enforce the July ruling. The guidelines suggest that Apple should be forced to terminate its existing agreements with five major publishers and also avoid entering similar agreements in the future with providers of music, movies and TV shows and games. The guidelines would put rules in place to prevent Apple from facilitating price-fixing among publishers, or from retaliating against publishers that refuse to bend to its terms. The Justice Department also suggested that Apple allow Amazon and Barnes & Noble to insert links inside their e-book apps to their e-bookstores, so that consumers can easily compare prices of e-books. \u201cThe court found that Apple\u2019s illegal conduct deprived consumers of the benefits of e-book price competition and forced them to pay substantially higher prices,\u201d William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust division, said in a statement. \u201cUnder the department\u2019s proposed order, Apple\u2019s illegal conduct will cease and Apple and its senior executives will be prevented from conspiring to thwart competition in the future.\u201d In a statement filed by Apple\u2019s legal counsel, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Apple said the government\u2019s proposal was a \u201cdraconian and punitive intrusion\u201d into its business. The \u201coverreaching proposal would establish a vague new compliance regime \u2014 applicable only to Apple \u2014 with intrusive oversight lasting for 10 years, going far beyond the legal issues in this case, injuring competition and consumers, and violating basic principles of fairness and due process,\u201d Apple\u2019s lawyer, Orin Snyder, said in its statement. \u201cThe resulting cost of this relief \u2014 not only in dollars but also lost opportunities for American businesses and consumers \u2014 would be vast.\u201d The Justice Department declined to comment. In the case, brought last year, the Justice Department accused Apple and five book publishers of conspiring to raise e-book prices. It cast Apple as the ringmaster of the conspiracy, colluding with the publishers to collectively help them defeat Amazon\u2019s uniform pricing of $9.99 for new e-books. As part of its pitch, Apple asked the publishers to switch to a different model of selling books, called agency pricing, in which the publishers set the price of the books instead of the retailers. The publishers\u2019 contracts with Apple included a so-called most-favored-nation clause, requiring that no other retailer sell e-books for a lower price; if they did, the publisher would have to match the price of the e-book in Apple\u2019s store. That, the Justice Department said, defeated price competition and resulted in higher prices across the industry. The Justice Department\u2019s proposed remedy would presumably prohibit Apple from using contracts with a most-favored-nation clause to help providers of music, TV shows and movies raise their prices. But it is unlikely that it would have implications for every contract that includes a most-favored-nation clause. The judge, Denise L. Cote, said in her ruling against Apple that the most-favored-nation clause itself was not the issue, but more specifically the manner in which the clause was used as a mechanism to execute a price-fixing conspiracy. Outside the book business, it is still unclear whether most-favored-nation clauses raise prices for other industries, like music, said Charles E. Elder, an antitrust lawyer at Irell & Manella. \u201cOne question is, to what extent would Apple\u2019s getting rid of most-favored-nation clauses in those industries help for competition?\u201d Mr. Elder said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that question, but it\u2019s one the court should think about before rubber-stamping a requested remedy by the Department of Justice.\u201d Judge Cote will hold a hearing next week to discuss the Justice Department\u2019s proposed remedy.

        "content": " Correction Appended One way to judge a streaming-video service \u2014 the only way, if you look at recent news coverage \u2014 is by its original series. By that measure, Hulu is the scrappy, undersized contender of the Big Three, ranking below Netflix, the steamrollering champion, but above Amazon, which is still standing outside the ring lacing its gloves. The analogy holds regardless of what you think about ballyhooed Netflix series like \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and the rebooted \u201cArrested Development\u201d and whether you think the company\u2019s streaming-video wing deserves its 14 Emmy nominations. It\u2019s undeniable that the shows Netflix has developed have a substance and sheen comparable to the output of premium cable channels like HBO and Showtime. The original series at Hulu are slighter and cheaper, falling somewhere between basic cable and YouTube. They\u2019re also less frequent:  \u201cThe Awesomes,\u201d Hulu\u2019s latest (it goes live on Thursday) and most high-profile original show, is its first since the travel series \u201cUp to Speed\u201d last August. All of Netflix\u2019s heavyweight shows have appeared since then, dominating the market. \u201cThe Awesomes,\u201d an animated superhero spoof featuring the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d mainstay and future \u201cLate Night\u201d host Seth Meyers, isn\u2019t going to shift the current balance of power. Neither is  \u201cQuick Draw,\u201d   another Hulu original (beginning Monday), in which the actor and writer John Lehr parodies both grim westerns of the \u201cDeadwood\u201d variety and forensic cop shows like \u201cCSI.\u201d Both shows are lightweight, gag-driven, hit-or-miss comedies that have their charms but won\u2019t be drawing any votes when next year\u2019s Emmy Awards come around. Is that just further proof that Hulu,  recently taken off   the auction block by its owners (21st Century Fox, the Walt Disney Company and NBCUniversal) but still facing an uncertain future, is doomed to second- or third-class status in streaming video? Perhaps, if all you pay attention to is original series. But they make up a tiny fraction of these companies\u2019 offerings, and it\u2019s worth stepping back to look at the overall picture. While Netflix and Amazon, as well as the Walmart service Vudu, have much more extensive movie offerings than Hulu, things are considerably different when it comes to TV, and especially current shows. Netflix is great for past seasons, but for episodes from current seasons, you\u2019re pretty much limited to Amazon Instant and Hulu. (Vudu and iTunes also offer current shows, but little or no original-series content.) The television selections at Amazon and Hulu overlap, and Amazon has more extensive offerings. The key difference \u2014 strangely seldom remarked on \u2014 is that Amazon charges at least $1.99 for each episode of many of the shows you would want to watch. That\u2019s on top of the $79 annual Amazon Prime membership. A Hulu Plus subscription of $8 a month gives you free viewing of all shows available on Hulu. This summer, that includes quite a few of the more noteworthy or popular series: \u201cThe Bridge\u201d from FX, \u201cTwisted\u201d and \u201cThe Fosters\u201d from ABC Family, \u201cGraceland\u201d from USA, \u201cLongmire\u201d and \u201cThe Glades\u201d from A&E, \u201cDevious Maids\u201d from Lifetime, \u201cMistresses\u201d and \u201cRookie Blue\u201d from ABC. And beyond the category of \u201coriginal\u201d lies the broader category of \u201cexclusive,\u201d generally referring to foreign TV series receiving their American premieres on just one online service. Netflix scored a coup here recently with the British crime show \u201cThe Fall,\u201d but Hulu has done the best job of securing and promoting interesting foreign shows, from the Israeli drama \u201cPrisoners of War\u201d (the inspiration for \u201cHomeland\u201d) to the Irish comedy \u201cMoone Boy\u201d and the Danish \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d clone \u201cKlown,\u201d added two weeks ago. The big downside at Hulu \u2014 and for many viewers it\u2019s a deal breaker \u2014 is the presence of commercials. But given the available selection and the price, many people may forgive 90-second ad breaks at the naturally occurring spots in TV shows. It\u2019s not that much more irritating than fast-forwarding through the commercials on your DVR. The real issue with Hulu\u2019s original series, as opposed to those on Netflix, is that they look insubstantial next to the regular TV fare, which is what you\u2019re really paying for. \u201cThe Awesomes,\u201d with Mr. Meyers as the voice of a very minor superhero who assumes the leadership of a Justice League-style team, is cute but, in its pilot episode, surprisingly ordinary. The live-action \u201cQuick Draw,\u201d with Mr. Lehr as the irritating, Harvard-educated sheriff in a dangerous Kansas town, is looser and funnier and might turn out to be more interesting. But they both leave Hulu waiting for its first big thing. It has a few more chances before the end of the year, including \u201cThe Wrong Mans\u201d (Nov. 11), a new British comedy whose cast includes very funny people like James Corden and Dawn French. Correction: August 1, 2013, Thursday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misidentified an actor starring in Hulu\u2019s animated series \u201cThe Awesomes.\u201d He is Seth Meyers, not John Lehr. Hulu hopes shows like \u201cThe Awesomes,\" starring Seth Meyers, will help the service gain ground on Netflix. | Hulu | \u201cQuick Draw,\u201d starring John Lehr. | Doug Huyn/Hulu | A scene from \u201cThe Awesomes.\u201d | Hulu",

        "name": "Wiesenthal Center Calls for Closing of German Magazine It Says Glorifies Nazism ",
        "content": " FRANKFURT -- The Waffen-SS is widely seen as one of the main perpetrators of the Holocaust, but not in the pages of Der Landser, a weekly German pulp magazine. In one recent issue, members of the feared World War II military unit were portrayed as just a bunch of good-natured soldiers doing their jobs and, between battles, sharing rounds of local plonk with Greek villagers grateful to have been invaded. ''We conquered them, and they're still a friendly folk,'' remarked one member of the squad, a unit that served as Hitler's personal bodyguard. That jarring view of history, in a magazine published by one of Germany's largest news media companies and available for download on Amazon and Apple's iTunes, has come under fire from a prominent American Jewish group. Acting on what it said were several recent complaints, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles invoked German laws against Nazi propaganda and Holocaust denials in asking Berlin last week to shut down Der Landser. German Interior Ministry officials said they took the Wiesenthal Center complaint ''very seriously'' and would investigate. But in the meantime, companies that print and distribute Der Landser said they would continue doing so, noting that previous legal challenges had failed to find fault with the editorial stance of the magazine, whose relatively small circulation belies its lightning-rod role in Germany. The new focus on Der Landser is the latest incarnation of a debate -- one that has lasted decades -- over the balance between free speech and efforts in Germany to eradicate the neo-Nazi movement and tamp down anti-Semitism. The magazine, which advertises that it is based on true events but also clearly includes fictional elements, studiously avoids mentioning the word ''Nazi'' and does not overtly propagate anti-Semitism. But critics say Der Landser, with its failure to acknowledge atrocities and little sense of regret for the deaths of millions of people, is stuck in a World War II time warp that ignores efforts by broader German society to come to terms with Nazi crimes. ''The way they interpret it, everyone in the Wehrmacht was just like in the American Army or the Canadian Army or the British Army,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Wiesenthal Center, using the term for the German armed forces at that time. ''They forget the most important point. People in this army were thugs and murderers who almost brought down Western civilization.'' He called Amazon's refusal to stop selling the magazine ''preposterous.'' But even some experts skeptical of the magazine's pseudo-historical tales of military heroics and camaraderie among German forces question whether it violates the prohibition against glorifying Nazism or denying the Holocaust. ''Legally, there is not much to grab on to,'' said Peter Conrady, a retired professor of literature at the University of Dortmund who has studied Der Landser. Mr. Conrady said the magazine subtly promotes nationalism by portraying German soldiers, even from the SS, as sympathetic everymen who were morally superior to their enemies. Mr. Conrady said a ban of the magazine would simply drive such material underground. It would be more useful to promote public knowledge of the issues raised by the magazine's portrayal of history, he said. ''It's important for the public to be aware of this phenomenon,'' he said. The magazine's editor in chief, Guntram Schulze-Wegener, who is in his late 40s, waved off assertions that Der Landser plays to contemporary extreme rightist sentiments. In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Schulze-Wegener, who also edits several other magazines about military history, said the content was nonpolitical. He declined to comment further, saying he first had to consult with his superiors. Der Landser's publisher, Bauer Media Group, cited previous rulings by German officials that the magazine did not violate any laws. Its own review of the magazine has concluded that it ''neither glorifies National Socialism nor downplays Nazi crimes,'' Bauer said in a statement. The company would not disclose the circulation of the magazine, widely distributed on newsstands and online, but about a decade ago it was estimated at 60,000, not counting special issues. Amazon said it would continue to sell the magazine after determining that it had previously passed muster with German officials who scrutinize the news media available to children. Apple, which offers Der Landser on iTunes, did not respond to e-mails and telephone messages asking whether it was aware of the magazine's content.",

And in an era when any publication, no matter how obscure, can be disseminated far and wide via the Internet, the controversy sharpens the focus on the question of whether companies like Amazon and Apple are responsible for scrutinizing what is being sold through their digital channels. The magazine, which advertises that it is based on true events but also clearly includes fictional elements, studiously avoids mentioning the word \u2018\u2018Nazi\u2019\u2019 and does not overtly propagate anti-Semitism. But critics say Der Landser, with its failure to acknowledge atrocities and displaying little sense of regret for the deaths of tens of millions of people, is stuck in a World War II time warp that ignores efforts by broader German society to come to terms with Nazi crimes. Even if Der Landser technically stays within legal bounds, critics contend, it nourishes a violence-prone, far-right subculture that is particularly strong in eastern Germany, where a rightist party has seats in the state Parliament of Saxony. The law enforcement authorities in Dresden, the capital of Saxony, said they often found copies of Der Landser when they raided homes of those suspected of being neo-Nazis. \u2018\u2018The way they interpret it, everyone in the Wehrmacht was just like in the American Army or the Canadian Army or the British Army,\u2019\u2019 said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Wiesenthal Center, using the term for the German armed forces at that time. \u2018\u2018They forget the most important point.

It has been the subject of several critical academic studies and reports in the German news media, and individual issues of the magazine have been sanctioned by a government office that vets news media content that could harm young people. But even some experts skeptical of its pseudo-historical tales of military heroics and camaraderie among German forces question whether the magazine violates the prohibition against glorifying Nazism or denying the Holocaust. \u2018\u2018Legally, there is not much to grab on to,\u2019\u2019 said Peter Conrady, a retired professor of literature at the University of Dortmund who has studied Der Landser. Mr. Conrady said the magazine subtly promotes nationalism by portraying German soldiers, even from the S.S., as sympathetic everymen who were morally superior to their enemies. Mr. Conrady said a ban of the magazine would simply drive such material underground. It would be more useful to promote public knowledge of the issues raised by the magazine\u2019s portrayal of history, he said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s important for the public to be aware of this phenomenon,\u2019\u2019 he said. The magazine is now produced by an editor young enough to be a grandchild of the war veterans, who waves off assertions that Der Landser plays to contemporary extreme rightist sentiments. In a brief telephone interview, Guntram Schulze-Wegener, the editor in chief of Der Landser, as well as several other magazines about military history, said the content was nonpolitical. Mr. Schulze-Wegener, who is in his late 40s, declined to comment further, saying he had to first consult with his superiors. Der Landser\u2019s publisher, Bauer Media Group, cited previous rulings by German officials that the magazine did not violate any laws. Its own review of the magazine has concluded that the magazine \u2018\u2018neither glorifies National Socialism nor downplays Nazi crimes,\u2019\u2019 Bauer saidin a statement. Bauer would not disclose the circulation of the magazine, widely distributed on newsstands and online, but about a decade ago it was estimated at 60,000, not counting special issues. Amazon said Friday that it would continue to sell the magazine after determining it had previously passed muster with German officials who scrutinize the news media available to children. Apple, which offers Der Landser on iTunes, did not respond to e-mails and telephone messages last week asking whether it was aware of the content of the magazine. The Wiesenthal Center said it planned to complain to Apple but had not done so as of Friday. If anything, the recent criticism from the Wiesenthal Center seems likely to bring new, unflattering attention to Bauer, which is based in Hamburg. The center was named for Simon Wiesenthal, the famed Nazi hunter who helped the authorities locate war criminals like Adolf Eichmann. Bauer is a privately owned publishing giant with extensive business in the United States and other markets outside Europe. Bauer\u2019s U.S. titles include In Touch, the celebrity magazine, and also several soap opera fan magazines, including ABC Soaps in Depth. It also publishes the German edition of Cosmopolitan and Australian editions of Rolling Stone and a girl\u2019s magazine called Disney Princess, according to the company\u2019s Web site. Rabbi Hier said the Wiesenthal Center decided to complain to Bauer, Amazon and the German authorities after receiving several complaints and reviewing a study conducted for the center by Stefan Klemp, a German journalist and historian. Mr. Klemp compiled evidence that numerous officers profiled reverentially in Der Landser belonged to units that had committed atrocities, even if they were never themselves convicted of war crimes. One recent issue, for example, described the exploits of August Zingel, a member of a so-called SS-Totenkopf, or \u2018\u2018Death\u2019s Head,\u2019\u2019 unit. Members of the Totenkopf units were notorious for their role running concentration camps, including Auschwitz, though that fact was not mentioned by Der Landser. According to the magazine, Mr. Zingel survived the war and died in 2000 at the age of 79. Far from being a mark of guilt, the silver skull insignia of the Totenkopf unit is portrayed in the story as a badge of honor. \u2018\u2018On the day that he was accepted into the SS-Totenkopf unit,\u2019\u2019 the text says of one soldier, \u2018\u2018he stepped out of the shadow of his older brother. He had made it.\u2019\u2019 The story tells how the soldier was then able to marry his dream wife, Edeltraud, who bore him two healthy children. Critics say the magazine provides fodder for the far right\u2019s fascination with World War II military awards and medals. The magazine features profiles of officers who were awarded the Knight\u2019s Cross, a version of the Iron Cross, which predated the rise of the Nazis but was appropriated by them. Der Landser is seen as part of a far-right subculture that evades bans on swastikas and blatant Nazi propaganda with an elaborate system of codes and cultural markers they use to identify themselves. A tattoo of the numbers \u2018\u201888\u2019\u2019 stands for \u2018\u2018HH\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Heil Hitler.\u2019\u2019 (H is the eighth letter in the alphabet.) Clothing with the Thor Steinar brand has become so closely associated with neo-Nazism that some soccer clubs refuse to allow people wearing the label into stadiums. The Iron Cross belongs to the catalog of favored neo-Nazi symbols. Der Landser also provides this subculture a body of literature they can call their own, critics say. Even outside far-right circles, though, there remains a debate in Germany about how much blame the regular German Army of World War II bears for war crimes. In April, a huge television audience tuned in for a three-part fictional mini-series, \u2018\u2018Unser M\u00fctter, unsere V\u00e4ter\u2019\u2019 (\u2018\u2018Our Mothers, Our Fathers\u2019\u2019), which dealt with how World War II distorted the moral outlook of five young German friends. The film depicted Wehrmacht soldiers murdering civilians, including children. Though the series generally won praise, a few critics argued that it ignored the large number of soldiers who were neither war criminals nor resisters, but were just trying to survive. Many Germans still regard the regular army as largely guilt-free. Joachim Wolf, who operates several anti-Nazi Web sites, said that Der Landser perpetuated the myth that atrocities were the work of a few fanatics and that most German soldiers remained \u2018\u2018pure.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "A New Role for Amazon: An Engine for Jobs ",
        "content": " American technology companies like Apple have been  criticized   for outsourcing manufacturing of their gadgets to China, rather than employing people to do the work in the United States. But one tech icon, Amazon, is seeking to call attention to the thousands of working-class jobs it\u2019s creating in the United States. On Monday, Amazon plans to announce it is creating more than 5,000 new full-time jobs in its United States warehouses to handle growing customer demand. The company currently employs more than 20,000 warehouse workers here, so the new positions represent a significant increase in its head count. Amazon\u2019s announcement is timed to coincide with a speech on middle-class jobs that President Obama is expected to give Tuesday at an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga, Tenn. The jobs will be in warehouses in 10 states, from Delaware to California. For a tech company, Amazon is an unusual hybrid of white- and blue-collar jobs. It employs plenty of computer scientists, MBAs and all the usual types found at technology companies. But it also relies on tens of thousands of people to do the sweaty, physical work of picking, packing and delivering Amazon orders. Those are jobs Amazon can\u2019t outsource to China (though the company, like nearly all electronics makers, does have its electronic device, the Kindle, made overseas). How great those jobs are is a matter of some debate. The working conditions in an Amazon warehouse in Pennsylvania, including excessive heat, was the subject of an  investigative article   in 2011 by The Morning Call newspaper in Lehigh Valley. The company says it remedied the heat problem by installing air-conditioning in its facilities. Amazon has also resisted union organizing at its warehouses. Amazon said median pay in its warehouses is 30 percent higher than retail pay in those same areas. That doesn\u2019t include the stock grants full-time employees receive, which over the past five years have added an average of 9 percent to workers\u2019 base pay annually. The sheer numbers of people Amazon is hiring has obviously landed the company on the radar screen of politicians stumping for job growth. Since September 2008, around the start of the most recent recession, Amazon said it has added more than 40,000 jobs in the United States, including warehouse and white-collar jobs. Just last week, Amazon  reported   that it has 97,000 full-time employees around the globe, an eye-popping 40 percent increase from a year ago. The additional 5,000 positions it plans to hire for will push its global head count above 100,000. By contrast, Apple  reported   its head count was over 72,000 at the end of last September.  Microsoft   has over 99,000 employees.  Hewlett-Packard   has more than 300,000 employees;  I.B.M.   has over 400,000 workers. But Amazon was founded in 1994, decades after those other companies. It has certainly  gotten big, fast .

        "content": " Amazon\u2019s razor-thin profits turned to razor-thin losses in the last quarter, as the Internet commerce giant continued to plow money into warehouses, digital content and other big investments that it says will pay off down the line. But with revenue up 22 percent, Amazon showed that it could still deliver the sales growth demanded by investors, who have lifted the company\u2019s stock 21 percent this year. So far, those demands do not include an insistence on big profits. Until it does, Amazon seems content to pour money into initiatives aimed at gobbling up an increasing share of spending by consumers. For the quarter that ended June 30, Amazon said late Thursday that it had a net loss of $7 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with net income of $7 million, or a penny a share, in the period a year earlier. Amazon\u2019s revenue was $15.7 billion, up from $12.83 billion a year earlier. The results were slightly below the estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, who had expected Amazon to report earnings of 5 cents a share and revenue of $15.73 billion. The miss did not seem to trouble investors too much. The company\u2019s stock was up 6.8 percent in afternoon trading Friday, after a 4.5 percent gain on Thursday. A good illustration of Amazon\u2019s long-term bets is online video. The company is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on licensing rights to build a large library of video that its customers can watch through their Kindle tablets and other devices. These agreements are critical as movies, music and other media, which account for 28 percent of Amazon\u2019s total sales, shift from physical to digital form. The company recently cut its biggest such deal ever, with a multiyear agreement to license television shows from Viacom, including children\u2019s shows like \u2018\u2018Dora the Explorer\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018SpongeBob SquarePants.\u2019\u2019 As a result, Amazon spent almost 47 percent more on technology and content in the quarter, for a total of $1.59 billion, or roughly 10 percent of its total revenue. Included in that spending is the company\u2019s investment in Amazon Web Services, a lucrative business through which it rents capacity in its data centers to other companies. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re investing for the large opportunities we have in front of us,\u2019\u2019 Tom Szkutak, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said during a conference call. While Amazon is feared as a seller of physical goods, it faces several formidable rivals in the digital content business, including Netflix, Apple, Hulu, Microsoft and Google. Still, Amazon is also spending aggressively on the warehouses it needs to deliver physical goods, building them ever closer to big cities with the goal of offering next-day, or even same-day, deliveries to shoppers. This year, Amazon started selling groceries in the Los Angeles area, using its own trucks to shuttle fruit, meat and boxes of cereal from a new warehouse in the city to customers\u2019 doorsteps. The effort is expensive and risky, though Amazon would not say whether or how much money it was losing on it. The grocery business has killed Internet retailers before \u2014 Webvan was the most notable casualty \u2014 so Amazon chose not to expand its service beyond a test in Seattle until recently. \u2018\u2018The challenge we\u2019ve had over the past several years is how to make it economically viable,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Szkutak said. All the spending on warehouses and other projects has led to a surge in hiring at the company. Its head count swelled to 97,000, up more than 40 percent from 69,000 a year ago. A big part of Amazon\u2019s allure for investors remains its pre-eminent position in e-commerce. E-commerce sales worldwide are expected to grow 18.3 percent this year to $1.3 trillion, according to eMarketer. Much of that growth is coming from Asia, the research group said. Kerry Rice, an analyst at Needham & Company, said many investors believed that Amazon could keep stealing market share from physical retailers, and that eventually its profits would improve. \u2018\u2018On some level, I think some people are buying the stock because they\u2019re hoping for that investment cycle to begin to reduce,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Rice said. \u2018\u2018If they pull back on spending, you\u2019re going to see that operating margin tick up.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "Amazon Rejected as Domain Name After South American Objections ",
        "content": " A group of Latin American countries appears to have succeeded in an effort to block Amazon, the online retailer, from using. amazon as a new suffix for Internet addresses. A committee of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, an international governance group for the Internet, recommended this week that. amazon not be approved for use as a so-called global top-level domain \u2014 the letters that follow the dot in Internet addresses. At a meeting in Durban, South Africa, Icann reviewed applications for new domain suffixes like these in what has been billed as the biggest expansion of Internet addresses. Scores of companies, countries and organizations have applied to use their names or other terms as global top-level domains, alongside the handful of existing ones like .com and .org. While Icann has approved several new dot-terms, including the Chinese word for game and the Russian word for network, English-language brand names derived from geographical locations have proved to be more complicated. In the run-up to the Durban meeting, a group of Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, sent a letter to Icann, in which they argued that. amazon should be rejected because a river runs through it. \u201cIn particular \u2018. amazon\u2019 is a geographic name that represents important territories of some of our countries, which have relevant communities, with their own culture and identity directly connected with the name,\u201d the letter said. \u201cBeyond the specifics, this should also be understood as a matter of principle.\u201d The group had also objected to another application, from the outdoor clothier Patagonia, to use its name as an address suffix. That application was withdrawn before the Durban meeting. The decision on. amazon, by the Governmental Advisory Committee of Icann, is not necessarily final. The Icann board could overrule the committee, though in practice it rarely does so. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing the G.A.C. advice and we look forward to working with Icann and other stakeholders to resolve these issues as the process moves forward,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. One thing that remains unclear is why the United States government, represented in the Government Advisory Committee by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, an arm of the Commerce Department, went along with the decision. The administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before the meeting, it sent a letter to Icann in which it outlined its support for the use of names like. amazon as Internet suffixes, but added that it would stand aside if other governments objected. \u201cThe United States affirms our support for the free flow of information and freedom of expression and does not view sovereignty as a valid basis for objecting to the use of terms, and we have concerns about the effect of such claims on the integrity of the process,\u201d the administration said in the letter. \u201cHowever, in the event the parties cannot reach agreement by the time this matter comes up for decision in the G.A.C., the United States is willing in Durban to abstain and remain neutral.\u201d One analyst said that while the specific reasons the United States government went along with the rejection were unclear, its position on Internet governance issues had been weakened by the recent leaks of information about a vast digital surveillance program by the National Security Agency. Several countries in South America \u2014 though not those in the Amazon basin or the Patagonian region \u2014 have offered the leaker, Edward J. Snowden, asylum. \u201cIt is clear that the leaks of sensitive national security information have severely weakened the U.S. government\u2019s ability to fight for our economic interests and have left the U.S. isolated in the G.A.C.,\u201d said Nao Matsukata, chief executive of FairWinds Partners, a Washington-based consulting firm that specializes in domain name strategy. Milton Mueller, a professor at the Syracuse University School of Information Studies, said there might have been an element of horse-trading. By yielding to a broader consensus on the advisory committee, Washington could have been seeking to shore up broader support for Icann, whose control over the Internet address system has long irked the governments of countries like Russia and China. \u201cMy hypothesis is that the U.S. government has been scared to death for some time that if G.A.C. doesn\u2019t get enough of what it wants, governments will give up on the whole Icann regime,\u201d Mr. Mueller said.

        "name": "A bookstore that is good for Amazon; The Media Equation ",
        "content": " On Thursday night in Clifton, New Jersey, Barnes & Noble was a way station, a third place between work and home where people sought respite and diversion. With its high ceilings, wide aisles and a large Starbucks, it is the kind of retail outlet that gives big-box stores a good name. In one aisle, a father and daughter were having a spirited generational discussion over the side-by-side covers of \u2018\u2018The Great Gatsby,\u2019\u2019 one of which bore an image of Leonardo DiCaprio. For reasons I was not quite clear about but nonetheless found charming, an older couple used a book on vegetarian cooking to cover up a copy of \u2018\u2018The Art of Seduction\u2019\u2019 on the shelf. Nearby, two apparent siblings, one sporting pink hair and the other purple, traded loud opinions over the True Crime display. Watching the readers lounge in chairs with a view of Route 3, it was hard to reconcile the pageantry of retailing with the brutal recent headlines about the book business. At the beginning of July, the Big Six publishers became the Big Five with the blending of Penguin and Random House. At the beginning of last week, the chief executive of Barnes & Noble left the company after a grim earnings report that highlighted a failed strategy to have the company\u2019s Nook device compete in the crowded tablet space. Then on Thursday, Judge Denise L. Cote of U.S. District Court in New York issued a withering decision against Apple, writing that the company had conspired with the major publishers to fix the price of e-books in an effort to thwart Amazon.com\u2019s momentum. So far, what has been bad for the industry has not yet hit consumers directly. If they are among the many millions of people enthralled by the CBS television mini-series \u2018\u2018Under the Dome\u2019\u2019 and decide to read the giant Stephen King novel that inspired it, they can hop on Amazon and buy it with a click for $13.99. Or they could avoid its door-stopping heft and spend just $7.99 for the Kindle version. No wonder that e-book sales boomed last year, including a 42 percent increase in sales of fiction. Net revenue for publishers also climbed more than $1 billion in 2012, to $15 billion, according to BookStats, an annual survey of the book business. But while publishers revel in the robust margins provided by e-books \u2014 no manufacturing, no shipping and no remaindering \u2014 the growth of Amazon leaves them as secondary characters in a business they used to control. Apple may be the one that was found guilty of setting prices, but Amazon has the kind of market power that allows it to set prices unilaterally. The company is already pulling back on discounts on scholarly and small-press books. Barnes & Noble tried to keep up with the technological shift, but the company\u2019s earnings were perforated by a $177 million loss from its Nook e-reader division, and that news took out William Lynch Jr., the chief executive, and threw a deep scare into publishers. In my view, Barnes & Noble is a company that did the right thing, and got clobbered anyway. When most media companies get into the device business, what pops out is clunky and useless, but the Nook is an excellent reading device that drew critical praise and, initially, buyers. At a time when legacy media companies are derided for letting the future overtake them, Barnes & Noble aggressively innovated. Amazon, however, had not only the Kindle, but consumer relationships, inventory and technical know-how that could not be overcome. And as consumers moved from e-readers to tablets to take advantage of other functions, like video, the Nook ended up in a corner. During the last Christmas season, Nook sales were down 12.6 percent compared with the period a year earlier. But the current spate of bad news may mask underlying strengths. As Bloomberg News pointed out on Thursday, Leonard Riggio, the 72-year-old architect of Barnes & Noble\u2019s national buildup, is still considering buying the physical stores and taking them private, in part because the fundamentals of that business are still solid, if not spectacular. In the fiscal year that ended in April, the retail stores and Web site generated earnings of $374.2 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a 16 percent increase, even as sales declined almost 6 percent. One of the parties that might want to root for Barnes & Noble is Amazon. Sales of e-books fell immediately after Borders went under, leading some to suggest that reduced opportunity to browse the physical artifact had resulted in less online buying. Having a bookstore in your neighborhood, as opposed to one that is bookmarked on your browser, is an invitation. Not long ago, I was walking by an airport bookstore and thought, \u2018\u2018What if this was the only place to buy books?\u2019\u2019 Similar to Hollywood, only the blockbusters would get shelf space. After Borders called it quits two years ago this week, Barnes & Noble became the last big chain where publishers could get the exposure for their books that allows readers to discover them, and to sell all manner of books big and small that are still part of the foundation of the industry. Morgan Entrekin, publisher at Grove/Atlantic, says everyone has skin in the retail game. \u2018\u2018We need to have a diversity of distribution channels to be healthy, and Amazon may want it all, but they are smart enough to know that. People can\u2019t live online all the time.\u2019\u2019 Bookstores offer discoverability, not just the latest Dan Brown or Carl Hiaasen book on the front table, but sometimes treasures deep in the stacks, a long tail of midlist authors and specialty books.Even as the book business consolidates, the physical object displayed in an actual place will continue to be an important part of the ecosystem. Let\u2019s hope it survives. From the balcony of the Barnes & Noble, what looked like the buzz of literary commerce was less impressive on closer inspection. The checkout line was busy because there were only two people working the registers. And the coffee shop was not so much an amenity for consumers on the go as a spot where people camped out and pawed over magazines they had not bought and probably never would. On the way out of the store, I saw the father and daughter who had been arguing over the \u2018\u2018Gatsby\u2019\u2019 cover. They had bought neither, but they had probably settled on which one they were going to buy on Amazon.",

        "content": " It came as no surprise that a federal judge on Wednesday ruled against Apple in an e-book price-fixing case. The easy money was always on the Justice Department, which had evidence that Apple conspired with five major book publishers to manipulate the market. Yet it remains an open question whether these legal proceedings served consumers\u2019 best interest. Before Apple launched its iBookstore in 2010, Amazon controlled 90 percent of the e-book market. Amazon set retail prices as it saw fit, often steeply discounting best-sellers and hawking them for $9.99, at a loss. Not unreasonably, publishers worried that Amazon was too dominant and were delighted when Apple came on the scene, introducing an \u201cagency model\u201d in which the publishers set retail prices and Apple took a cut. Apple proposed price caps of $12.99 and $14.99 for new releases, with contracts that also included a \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d clause: if a competitor\u2019s list price for an e-book ever dipped below Apple\u2019s, the publishers would match it, allowing the iBookstore to offer the best deal. The Justice Department argued, and Judge Denise Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan agreed, that Apple \u201cfacilitated a horizontal conspiracy\u201d to eliminate retail price competition. Once the publishers were cozy with Apple, the Justice Department said, they used that relationship as a cudgel against Amazon, threatening to withhold new content unless Amazon moved to the agency model and let prices rise. The strategy worked. Amazon switched, and its prices went up. To make its case, the government unearthed a telling e-mail from Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s chief executive at the time, in which he said he could tolerate Apple\u2019s contracts with the publishers \u201cas long as they move Amazon to the agent model too for new releases for the first year.\u201d Apple plans to appeal the decision. The big picture is that while Apple\u2019s pact with the publishers raised prices in the short term, it also brought much-needed competition to the e-book marketplace. It is  estimated   that Apple now controls 10 percent of that market and Amazon 65 percent, with Barnes & Noble and others splitting the rest. That is healthier for the publishers and for consumers, too.

        "content": " Over the 15 years I\u2019ve been consulting in the corporate world, I\u2019ve only met a handful of senior leaders who had as a primary goal for their companies making a positive difference in the world. Surely, there are more such people, including a good number who are highly philanthropic outside their work. Still, as best as I can tell, higher purpose is not a common characteristic of the corporate world. I don\u2019t say this to bash business, nor to make a moral case for why leaders ought to focus more on serving the greater good. I fully understand that a primary obligation of any business is to earn a profit, and that without one, nothing else is possible. I also know that no amount of righteous haranguing is going to prompt leaders to fully embrace priorities beyond the bottom line. But what if they believed that articulating and embracing a nobler purpose would help them to attract, inspire and retain better employees, and ultimately make their companies more profitable? As  John Mackey   and Raj Sisodia put it in their book \u201cConscious Capitalism,\u201d \u201cJust as happiness is best experienced by not aiming for it directly, profits are best achieved by not making them the primary goal of the business. They are the outcome when companies do business with a higher sense of purpose.\u201d Professor Sisodia\u2019s research, which I\u2019ve cited before, suggests that \u201cconscious companies\u201d\u2014 characterized in part by an explicit commitment to a higher purpose \u2013 outperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index from 1996 to 2011 by an astonishing 10.5 to 1. Much of this is common sense. All things being equal, would you rather work at a company focused solely on maximizing profits, or one with a deep commitment to adding real value to the world through its products, practices and services? Wouldn\u2019t you find a greater sense of meaning by working for the latter, feel a greater sense of commitment and be less likely to leave? Employee engagement in the United States (and throughout most of the world) remains depressingly low. According to the latest Gallup poll, 70 percent of Americans are either not engaged or are actively disengaged from their companies. According to Gallup, the cost to productivity just from the actively disengaged employees is $450 billion to $550 billion a year. In the simplest terms, a purpose defines the difference an organization is trying to make in the world. In some cases, that\u2019s a natural and straightforward outgrowth of what the organization actually does to earn a profit. Whole Foods, for example, is explicitly committed to helping people to eat well, as a way to improve the quality of their lives and increase their lifespan. Patagonia sets out to model sustainable environmental practices by taking complete responsibility for every product it makes \u2013 repairing, recycling and helping people sell those products when they no longer need them. Eileen Fisher, the clothing company, has a five-part mission that includes producing \u201conly what we love,\u201d creating a \u201cjoyful atmosphere in the workplace\u201d and \u201csupporting women through social initiatives that address their well-being.\u201d Or put even more simply: \u201cHave our mission drive our business and our profitability foster our mission.\u201d There are many ways to create a nobler purpose in an organization, even if the products or services themselves intrinsically do not. Toms Shoes, for example, makes a very conventional product, but founder Blake Mycoskie has infused passion among employees partly by giving away, with each purchase of a pair of shoes, a second pair to someone needy. Now Toms is expanding that model to other products, including eyewear. The company is also consistently profitable, not least because its noble purpose is differentiating, and appealing to consumers. We live in a highly commoditized world. Why couldn\u2019t a big bank differentiate itself by using a matching model like Toms does and offer, say, financial planning to those who are needy? It\u2019s also possible to build a noble purpose around caring deeply about your customers. Think of  Amazon.com , Zappos, Ritz Carlton and  Southwest Airlines . Likewise, you can create a higher purpose around the commitment to truly great products and inspiring design, as  Apple   did under  Steven P. Jobs . Here are three questions I believe all chief executives ought to regularly ask themselves, not just to be good citizens, but as a powerful way to build competitive advantage: What is our noblest purpose and are we fulfilling it? How can we give our employees a greater sense of meaning in what they do, so they feel more enthusiastic about coming to work every morning? In what practical ways can we add more value in the world (and do less harm)? Comparing the Valuations Behind Amazon and Apple Shares Case Study: Can Honest Tea Say No to  Coke?

        "name": "E-book ruling gives Amazon an advantage; While Apple faces a fine, its publishing rival is free to exert its dominance ",
        "content": " Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, loves disrupting markets. In that regard, he must be having a delightful summer. The book business, once so mired in the past it seemed part of the antiques trade, is up for grabs. A U.S. judge ruled Wednesday that Apple had illegally conspired with five of the six biggest publishers to try to raise prices in the budding e-book market. The decision came two days after Barnes & Noble lost its chief executive and said it would not appoint another, signaling that the biggest chain of physical bookstores could be immediately broken up. The verdict in the Apple case might have been a foregone conclusion, telegraphed by the judge herself, but it emphatically underlined how the traditional players in the book business have been upended. Only Amazon, led by Mr. Bezos, seems to have a plan. He is executing it with a skill that infuriates his competitors and rewards his stockholders. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re at a moment when cultural power is passing to new gatekeepers,\u2019\u2019 said Joe Esposito, a publishing consultant. \u2018\u2018Heaven forbid that we should have the government telling our entrepreneurs what to do, but there is a social policy issue here. We don\u2019t want the companies to become a black hole that absorbs all light except their own.\u2019\u2019 The Apple case, which was brought by the Justice Department, will have little immediate effect on the selling of books. The publishers settled long ago, protesting that they had done nothing wrong but saying they could not afford to fight the government. But it might be a long time before they try to take charge of their fate again in such a bold fashion. Drawing the attention of the government once was bad enough; twice could be a disaster. \u2018\u2018The Department of Justice has unwittingly caused further consolidation in the industry at a time when consolidation is not necessarily a good thing,\u2019\u2019 said Mark Coker, the chief executive of Smashwords, an e-book distributor. \u2018\u2018If you want a vibrant ecosystem of multiple publishers, multiple publishing methods and multiple successful retailers in 5, 20 or 50 years, we took a step backwards this week.\u2019\u2019 Some in publishing suspected that Amazon had prompted the U.S. government to file its lawsuit. The retailer has denied it, but it still emerged the big winner. While Apple will be punished \u2014 damages are yet to be decided \u2014 and the publishers were chastened, Amazon is left free to exert its dominance over e-books \u2014 even as it gains market share with physical books. The retailer declined to comment Wednesday. \u2018\u2018Amazon is not in most of the headlines, but all of the big events in the book world are about Amazon,\u2019\u2019 said Paul Aiken, executive director of the Authors Guild. \u2018\u2018If the publishers colluded, it was to blunt Amazon\u2019s dominance. Barnes & Noble\u2019s troubles may stem from a misstep with its Nook tablets, just as Borders\u2019s bankruptcy might have been hastened by management mistakes, but its precarious position is that of any rent-paying retailer facing a deep-pocketed virtual competitor.\u2019\u2019 Last week, Penguin and Random House officially merged, creating a publishing behemoth that might be able to determine its future rather than suffer the fate of Barnes & Noble, a once-swaggering entity that now seems adrift. Random House was not a target of the Justice Department; Penguin was. Penguin and Random House were innovators who made paperbacks into a disruptive force in the 1940s and 1950s. They were the Amazons of their era, making the traditional book business deeply uneasy. No less an authority than George Orwell thought paperbacks were of so much better value than hardbacks that they spelled the ruination of publishing and bookselling. \u2018\u2018The cheaper books become,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, \u2018\u2018the less money is spent on books.\u2019\u2019 Orwell was wrong, but the same arguments are being made against Amazon and e-books today. Amazon executives are not much for public debate, but they argue that all this disruption will ultimately give more money to more authors and make books more widely available at cheaper prices, and who could argue with any of that? That was not a prospect that many on Wednesday were putting much faith in. Amazon, its detractors argue, is not a nonprofit organization or a public trust but a hard-nosed company with investors who hope it will make lots of money someday soon. Its shares closed Wednesday at a record high of $292.33 and were heading for another record Thursday, up 2 percent to $298.25 in afternoon trading in New York. \u2018\u2018The Justice Department\u2019s guns seem pointed in the wrong direction,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Aiken said. But the more pressing concern for the industry is the fate of Barnes & Noble. When the book retailer Borders collapsed two years ago, analysts said there was an unexpected consequence to the loss of 400 stores: the e-book growth rate began to taper off, as readers could no longer examine new titles before ordering them from Amazon. E-books, in other words, were not a magical technology that could shed all the existing infrastructure of publishing. They needed the bookstores. \u2018\u2018If all of those corporate outlets vanish, there is suddenly a hell of a lot less space devoted to showcasing a large number of titles,\u2019\u2019 said J.B. Dickey, owner of the Seattle Mystery Bookshop. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ll probably see a continuing shrinking in print runs, maybe fewer titles published, fewer authors published and the New York houses retreating into the known best-sellers. Which means more novice and midlist authors scrambling to find a way to stay in print and more authors self-publishing their print books \u2014 or more likely releasing their works as e-files.\u2019\u2019 All of that sounds dire. Perhaps the only consolation for those who fear the power of Amazon is the knowledge that all companies eventually peak, no matter how unlikely that seems as they rise. Mr. Esposito, the consultant, remembered that 30 years ago there was a book called \u2018\u2018The Media Monopoly,\u2019\u2019 which worried about the excessive power of the Gannett chain of newspapers as well as the three major U.S. television networks.",

        "content": " There have been some big shifts in e-books lately. First, a judge this week found that  Apple was guilty of price-fixing e-books   \u2014 colluding with other e-book vendors to keep prices high. Apple says it will appeal the decision. Second, Barnes & Noble\u2019s chief executive, William Lynch, has resigned. He was appointed in March 2010 to lead the bookseller into the high-tech age (he had been an executive at Palm and Home Shopping Network). But sales haven\u2019t been going well with Barnes & Noble, electronically or otherwise. I\u2019ve had my clashes with Mr. Lynch. Twice, I\u2019ve publicly called out the company for cheating in the way it advertised its Nook e-readers. Once,  it understated the Nook\u2019s weight   by an ounce. Another time,  it advertised a   Nook   to have a high-definition screen when it didn\u2019t. \u201cLook, Barnes. Listen, Noble,\u201d I wrote. \u201cYou have a perfectly good product. You don\u2019t have to stretch the truth to sell it.\u201d Mr. Lynch called me up, deeply upset, to ask if I had some kind of ax to grind with Barnes & Noble (I didn\u2019t, and don\u2019t). But in both cases, he did order the advertising changed to correct the misleading specs. But his departure, I suspect, has to do with the failure of the Nook over all. According to the research firm IDC, Barnes & Noble\u2019s tablet market share wasn\u2019t even in the top five for the first three months of this year. Last week, Barnes & Noble said that it would stop making color Nook tablets. That\u2019s it: Amazon won that battle, and has no more competition. (Barnes & Noble says that the color tablets will be \u201cco-branded with yet-to-be-announced third-party manufacturers of consumer electronics products,\u201d whatever that means. Barnes & Noble will still design and sell the black-and-white tablets, like the Nook SimpleTouch and Glowlight.) It\u2019s really too bad. The color Nooks were easily competitive with Amazon\u2019s Kindle Fire \u2014 better in many ways. The color Nooks could run any Android app, not just a handpicked special selection. They have memory-card slots so you can expand the storage. In fact,  CNET argues   that there\u2019s never been a better time to buy a color Nook, since the company has slashed the prices. At the moment, they cost far less than Amazon\u2019s equivalent Kindle: $130 for the 7-inch model (Amazon\u2019s is $170), $150 for the 9-incher (Amazon\u2019s is $270). The problem, of course, is the copy protection. Idiotically, each tech giant in the e-book game (Apple, Amazon, Barnes & Noble) developed a different, incompatible form of copy protection for its books. Once Barnes & Noble drops out of the game completely, any e-books you bought for your Nook will probably become unreadable. Betamaxed, you might say. (Yes, there are Nook apps for Mac and Windows, but  Barnes & Noble abandoned them   some time ago. There\u2019s also a way to read these books on a Web page, but it doesn\u2019t work for many e-book titles. The company still has a Windows 8 app that can read its books.) So the bottom line is all bad news. People who bought e-books from Barnes & Noble may wind up with libraries they can\u2019t read. Amazon no longer has a competitor to keep it on its toes (and its prices low). The future of Barnes & Noble\u2019s e-book business now looks murky, which means that even more customers will stay away, creating a vicious cycle of declining sales. In the end, it may be that all we can salvage from this smoking mess is a lesson or two \u2014 although what they might be escapes me at the moment.

        "name": "Latest vision for downtrodden Las Vegas: A downtown vibe; Billionaire aims to create a scene that has nothing to do with gambling ",
        "content": " Tony Hsieh didn\u2019t look much like a modern-day Bugsy Siegel. Wearing backpack, T-shirt and jeans, standing outside a downtown bar, he patrolled his future empire along East Fremont Street here one sweltering morning. But the flamboyant Siegel changed this city for good when he built the Flamingo Hotel, the first luxury casino on the Strip. Now Mr. Hsieh, a soft-spoken 39-year-old Internet billionaire who runs Zappos, the online clothing store, plans to do something as transformative. It\u2019s a classic American dream: a Western-scale roll of the dice in a city that suddenly conjured up Belle \u00c9poque Paris and ancient Rome out of the desert. The idea this time is to build a version of the Mission district in San Francisco or the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in downtown Vegas. Mr. Hsieh is relocating Zappos headquarters from Henderson, Nevada, about 16 miles away, or 25 kilometers, and investing hundreds of millions of his dollars to retrofit downtown with, well, a downtown, in line with the latest trends. There is not much to see yet, but his $350 million Downtown Project \u2014 a mix of investments, acquisitions and loans \u2014 envisions blocks and blocks of pedestrian-friendly, small-business-oriented, high-density, high-tech urbanism in long-depressed and troubled neighborhoods. Zappos will take over the decrepit old City Hall. That gesture alone, salvaging a local landmark, has endeared Mr. Hsieh to many here. The Downtown Project also will seed tech start-ups, boutiques, mom-and-pop restaurants and bars; the world\u2019s largest Airstream trailer park; a playground and geodesic dome; a complex of recording studios; a charter school; a doggy day care; a bike share program; a Tesla electric car share; and theaters for TED Talk-like lecturers and music festivals. There\u2019s no designer-led master plan, no single billion-dollar construction project, no star architect. The concept is top-down but preaches piecemeal, bottom-up development and reuse. It exploits a picturesque supply of abandoned flop houses, vacant offices and collapsing warehouses, capitalizing on a growing desire among young Americans for urban life: an anti-Strip vision of America. Out on the Strip, MGM opened CityCenter in 2009, a $7.8 billion luxury development and celebrity-architect petting zoo, which in a sense is the same concept, but pegged as a theme park for tourists. It\u2019s a smart and sleek attraction; business has been improving. CityCenter and the Downtown Project are both visions for evolving the same city. But unlike MGM\u2019s development, which opened in the midst of the housing collapse, Mr. Hsieh\u2019s timing could hardly have been better. The local economy, devastated when the bubble burst, is limping back. The population (increasingly young Asians and Hispanics) keeps rising, and wealthy out-of-towners prop up the high end of the housing market. Most properties are still under water, and the city is down 100,000 construction jobs from pre-recession highs, but the picture isn\u2019t as bleak, or straightforward, as four years ago. At the same time, Las Vegas suffers the pitfalls of being a one-industry town. Baked into its economy are minimal taxes and a state government inclined to ship much of what Las Vegas contributes to the rest of Nevada, which, among other consequences, insures the school system is perennially poor. Casino moguls, needing a steady supply of parking attendants, hotel maids and blackjack dealers, not college-educated workers, were once fine with that. But times are changing. Now the lack of good public schools and downtown amenities \u2014 demanded by those mobile and educated young Americans other cities are competing to attract \u2014 has become a liability. On top of which, Las Vegans young and old complained about not having \u2018\u2018authentic places,\u2019\u2019 which are \u2018\u2018locally owned, one of a kind, less corporate,\u2019\u2019 as Tyler Jones, a 35-year-old architect-developer of luxury homes and third-generation Las Vegan, put it. They wanted a Las Vegas for Las Vegans. Which is where Mr. Hsieh comes in. Downtown began to decline by the 1960s. The casinos, department stores and middle-class homeowners fled south to the Strip, seizing upon cheap and plentiful land. In the 1990s, the Fremont Experience turned five desperate blocks of what used to be the heart of the downtown gambling scene into a pedestrian concourse beneath a lighted canopy that pulled in low-end tourists but few jobs or residents. It\u2019s now a blighted attraction. Neonopolis arrived in 2002, a retail and entertainment mall, which soon went belly up, leaving a fortress-size hole amid the pawn shops and homeless shelters. Since then, there has been progress. The Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, designed by Frank Gehry, opened downtown in 2010; the popular Smith Center for the Performing Arts, a $485 million project, last year; along with a new City Hall. And back in 2007, a small bohemian speakeasy called the Downtown Cocktail Room opened on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Boulevard, once the main intersection. Hanging out in the Cocktail Room a few years ago, Mr. Hsieh began to picture a different vision for the neighborhood: as an affordable locus for upscale young adults, having little or nothing to do with gambling. In some ways, the most fascinating aspect of this vision is the relocation of Zappos. Moving its headquarters downtown represents a pointed alternative to the multibillion-dollar suburban office parks that Google and Apple are building in Silicon Valley, notwithstanding that so many of their own employees want to live in, and commute from, San Francisco. Mr. Hsieh has bought into the solid notion that chance encounters on the street or at a club urban collisions \u2014 spark innovation: cities, inherently, nurture the economy and culture. It\u2019s a gentrifying idea that comes at the cost of displacing some existing businesses whose owners say downtown Las Vegas wasn\u2019t a blank slate. Critics like Joel Kotkin, a fellow of Urban Futures at Chapman University, have told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that Mr. Hsieh\u2019s project commits tax dollars (by, for instance, helping finance Zappos\u2019s purchase of the old City Hall) that might otherwise be spent on training programs or buses. But then there\u2019s Eat. It\u2019s the antithesis of the celebrity chef chains on the Strip \u2014 more like some neighborhood hot spot you\u2019d stumble across in Austin, Texas. Natalie Young, the chef and owner, having grown tired of her job on the Strip, opened the place with a no-interest $225,000 loan from the Downtown Project. When she fell behind on her apartment rent, according to The Review-Journal, she called Michael Cornthwaite, a friend, who owns the Cocktail Room. His wife showed up at Ms. Young\u2019s door with a check. Eat has since been hopping. That story encapsulates the sort of communal entrepreneurship that Mr. Hsieh hopes to inspire. I toured the East Fremont district with Don Welch, one of Mr. Hsieh\u2019s partners, who talked in the dreamy, assured way developers do about filling blocks and blocks of vacant land in the next few years with a bustle of businesses and people. We\u2019ll see. Short term, success depends on Mr. Hsieh\u2019s running the table, investment-wise. A range of business leaders, local converts to civic diversification, not just from the gambling industry, hopes he does. Long term, success will depend on a broader vision, which incorporates downtown casinos that have reinvested in themselves, like the El Cortez, along with establishments that haven\u2019t. And new development will need to be integrated with existing schools, homeless shelters and convenience stores, so the city doesn\u2019t simply end up with an isolated hipster office park. That Caesars Entertainment on the Strip is also retrofitting urban-style streetscapes for tourists suggests Mr. Hsieh\u2019s project is making some waves. It\u2019s in contrast to the marooned, star-architect-driven mega-developments like the Smith Center, which are, so far, poorly knitted into the fabric of downtown streets. Mr. Hsieh isn\u2019t himself thinking in terms of new architecture yet. He\u2019s repurposing vernacular buildings, though the project, in its open-endedness, would seem to present an opportunity for resourceful architects to pitch the virtues of inventive new design. Hard as it may be not to feel skeptical, the small-scale civic principles are solid. And sometimes a single determined mogul is just what a struggling city needs.",

        "name": "Chief Leaves Book Chain After Losses On E-Readers ",
        "content": " William Lynch Jr., the chief executive of Barnes & Noble, resigned on Monday, two weeks after a devastating earnings report that accentuated the bookseller's losing battle against powerful rivals like Amazon. Mr. Lynch's departure was part of a series of sweeping changes the company announced as it tries to regain its footing after a failed initiative to build up its Nook division and compete in the increasingly crowded market for e-readers. When it revealed its fourth-quarter earnings late last month, Barnes & Noble said it would cease making its own color tablets, an acknowledgment that they were lagging popular brands like Amazon's Kindle Fire and Apple's iPad. Instead, the company said it would form partnerships with third parties to make the color devices, while it continued to make and sell its own black-and-white versions of the Nook. In a statement late Monday, the company said that Michael P. Huseby had been appointed chief executive of the Nook division and president of Barnes & Noble. Mr. Huseby has served as chief financial officer since joining Barnes & Noble in March 2012; previously he held that position at Cablevision Systems, a media company. Max J. Roberts, the chief executive of the college division, will report to Mr. Huseby, while Mr. Huseby and Mitchell S. Klipper, the chief executive for the retail stores, will report to Leonard Riggio, the company's chairman. The moves on Monday appeared to be a step toward separating the digital and retail divisions, as the company has indicated it might do. Barnes & Noble has been in talks over a potential sale of its digital assets, as well as its 675 bookstores. Microsoft is one potential buyer of the Nook business; last year it invested hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire 17.6 percent of the division. Mr. Riggio has expressed interest in taking back ownership of the physical stores that make Barnes & Noble the largest bookstore chain in the country. Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble, declined to provide an update on that offer. There was no indication that a new chief executive would be named. ''Because the company is in a transition period, we have no immediate plans to name a C.E.O.,'' Ms. Keating said. ''We thank William Lynch for helping transform Barnes & Noble into a leading digital content provider and for leading in the development of our award-winning line of Nook products,'' Mr. Riggio said in a statement issued Monday. ''As the bookselling industry continues to undergo significant transformation, we believe that Michael, Mitchell and Max are the right executives to lead us into the future.'' The financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter underscored the urgency of the need to take action. The Nook unit showed a $177 million loss in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, more than doubling the loss from the period a year earlier. Sales fell 34 percent, to $108 million. The signs have been ominous for the company since the beginning of the year, when it announced that sales for the nine-week holiday period in late 2012 had declined at both its bookstores and in the Nook unit. Mr. Lynch joined Barnes & Noble in February 2009, with no previous experience in bookselling. He was executive vice president for marketing at HSN.com and also worked for Gifts.com. At the time, his arrival was hailed as a forward-thinking move, since Mr. Lynch, a Texas native, was only 39 years old and fluent in e-commerce and technology. Within months, Barnes & Noble introduced its first Nook e-reader. To publishers, Mr. Lynch had performed a temporary miracle, helping create a product that provided a welcome competitor to Amazon's Kindle, which dominated the market and offered e-books at a relatively inexpensive price. The Nook was initially successful, drawing critical praise and capturing consumers who were uneasy about buying an e-reader -- at the time a brand-new device -- online, without testing it out in person. Barnes & Noble's hundreds of retail stores allowed potential customers to see and touch what they were buying. But even though Barnes & Noble quickly gained a sizable piece of the e-book market, it was not enough to ward off Amazon. And as black-and-white e-readers gave way to multifunctional color tablets, Barnes & Noble found itself competing unsuccessfully against companies many times its size, like Amazon and Apple, that have had technology in their DNA from the start. As chief executive, Mr. Lynch worked from the company's Ninth Avenue office in Manhattan, across town from the Fifth Avenue building where Mr. Riggio keeps his office. Mr. Lynch threw his energies into the digital side of the business, taking far less of an interest in the retail stores, and frequently flew to Palo Alto to build up Barnes & Noble's presence in Silicon Valley, where their e-readers are designed. Mike Shatzkin, the founder and chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a publishing consultant, said a split of the business could help stave off the company's decline. ''The Nook business clearly is going to need some global investment to have any kind of chance at all, and it certainly looks possible that they will be better off separate than together,'' Mr. Shatzkin said. ''There's a glide path to oblivion, and you can affect the speed of the decline. Nobody's going to bring back a robust brick-and-mortar book business.'' William Lynch resigned as chief, and was not replaced. (PHOTOGRAPH BY PETER DaSILVA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (B1); William Lynch, who resigned as chief, with a version of the Nook.

        "name": "Q&A: Avoiding Mobile Malware ",
        "content": " Q. Why is Android such a big target for malware, and how can I tell if an app may be suspect before I install it? A. Android has become the dominant mobile operating system around the world, and like Windows before it, malware writers typically target the most commonly used platform in hopes of snaring the most victims. Not all phones can run the latest, more secure versions of the Android system, which can make them more vulnerable to malicious apps. Third-party app sites help spread malicious software as well. Common sense and a discerning eye can help keep your device safe. If you want to avoid malicious apps, get new software from trusted sources like the Google Play store or Amazon\u2019s Android app store \u2014 and avoid installing any apps from random third-party sites. Although it does not make developers go through a formal approval process when submitting new apps, Google does  automatically scan apps   that are added to its Google Play store for malware. The company has also  withdrawn bad apps   that have wormed their way into the store. Sticking with apps from well-known developers or apps that have been professionally reviewed can help keep you away from the junk and scam programs that may have made it into the store. (Badly written or spammy apps are a universal problem and Apple\u2019s App Store has plenty of those, too.) Even when shopping in the Google Play store, you should thoroughly check out an app before installing it. Be wary of apps that seem to have a lot of downloads and high ratings \u2014 but a minimal amount of written reviews \u2014 since a scammer may be trying to get attention. You can also check the app\u2019s Permissions tab on the Google Play page to see what parts of your Android phone or tablet it wants to use, and then avoid apps that look too invasive. If you like to visit third-party app sites, you may want to consider installing  mobile security software   from a reliable company. Some apps, like  Lookout   or  F-Secure , also help track lost phones and remotely wipe data \u2014 because a missing or stolen device may be more of a security problem than malware for many people anyway.

Now, the book, \u2018\u2018Born to Lose,\u2019\u2019 is losing momentum \u2014 yet Amazon.com, to the writer\u2019s intense frustration, has increased the price by nearly a third. \u2018\u2018At this point, people need an inducement,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Hollock, a retired corrections official. \u2018\u2018But instead of lowering the price, Amazon is raising it.\u2019\u2019 Other writers and publishers have the same complaint. They say Amazon, which became the biggest force in bookselling by discounting so heavily it often lost money, has been cutting back on its deals for scholarly and small press books. That creates the uneasy prospect of a two-tier system in which some books are priced beyond the reach of an audience. There is no way to track the movement of prices on Amazon, so the evidence is anecdotal and fragmentary. But books are among the few consumer items that still have prices printed on them. Any Amazon customer who uses the retailer\u2019s \u2018\u2018Saved for Later\u2019\u2019 basket has noticed that its prices have all the permanence of plane fares. No explanation is ever given for why a price has changed. Bruce Joshua Miller, president of Miller Trade Book Marketing, a Chicago firm representing university and independent presses, said he recently surveyed 18 publishers. \u2018\u2018Fourteen responded and said Amazon had over the last few years either lowered discounts on scholarly books or, in the case of older or slow-selling titles, completely eliminated them,\u2019\u2019 he said. Amazon says it is not belatedly trying to improve its anemic profit margins. \u2018\u2018We are actually lowering prices,\u2019\u2019 said Sarah Gelman, an Amazon spokeswoman. \u2018\u2018We pay for these price decreases with relentless focus on improving our execution \u2014 and this commitment to low prices is one of the reasons our print books business continues to grow.\u2019\u2019 Offered a list of random titles whose discounts had dropped, she said she would not talk about specific books. They included David Foster Wallace\u2019s essay on John McCain, which went to 10 percent off from 20 percent. Ellen Galinsky\u2019s \u2018\u2018Mind in the Making\u2019\u2019 went to 24 percent off from 32 percent. Jim Harrison\u2019s \u2018\u2018Songs of Unreason\u2019\u2019 dropped to 16 percent off from 32 percent. Higher prices have implications beyond annoyed authors. For all the hoopla around e-books, old-fashioned printed volumes are still a bigger business. Amazon sells about one in four printed books in the United States, according to industry estimates, a level of market domination with little precedent in the book trade. It is an achievement built on superior customer service, a vast range of titles and, most of all, rock-bottom prices that no physical store could hope to match. As Amazon became one of the largest retailers in the United States, it never seemed interested in charging enough to make a profit. Customers celebrated and the competition languished. Now \u2014 with traditional U.S. book retailers like Borders dead, Barnes & Noble struggling, and independent booksellers greatly diminished \u2014 for many consumers there is simply no other way to get many books than through Amazon. And for some books, Amazon is, in effect, beginning to raise prices. Stephen Blake Mettee, chairman of the board of the Independent Book Publishers Association, said Amazon was simply following in the tradition of any large company that gains control of a market. \u2018\u2018You lower your prices until the competition is out of the picture, and then you raise your prices and get your money back,\u2019\u2019 he said. Authors like Mr. Hollock say they feel helpless about Amazon\u2019s control. Mr. Hollock says he has called Amazon several times to ask why the price of his book was going up and has never received an answer that made sense. In its 16 years as a public company, Amazon has received rare permission from Wall Street to concentrate on expanding its infrastructure, increasing revenue at the expense of profit. Stockholders have pushed Amazon shares up to a record level, even though the company makes only pocket change. Profits were always promised tomorrow. Small publishers wonder whether tomorrow is finally here, and they are the ones who will pay for it. Curt Matthews, chief executive of Independent Publishers Group, a Chicago book distributor that got into a dispute with Amazon last year over margins on e-books, speculated that Amazon could be data-mining its customers. \u2018\u2018They are wondering, \u2018If we knock off only 10 percent as opposed to 35 percent, where do we come out ahead?\u2019\u2019\u2019 Mr. Matthews said. \u2018\u2018They don\u2019t care how many books they sell, they want to know how many dollars they get.\u2019\u2019 For Mr. Hollock, the \u2018\u2018Born to Lose\u2019\u2019 author, the issue is readers, not dollars. His award-winning book, published by Kent State University Press, had a steep list price of $35 to begin with. In the author\u2019s view, Amazon is simply compounding the trouble by raising its price to more than $30 from $23. \u2018\u2018I see all these other books out there that are cheaper,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Hollock said. \u2018\u2018I thought, \u2018Man alive, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to compete.\u2019\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "The Price of Amazon ",
        "content": " The Amazon.com story is remarkable. Within living memory, bookselling was a local activity. A major city would have two or three large independent stores selling new books and other large, scruffier stores selling secondhand books. Paperbacks would receive wide if uneven circulation on bus station and drugstore racks. It was not a perfect system, but it had the advantage of being diffuse and thus hard to control. The hippie, black and women\u2019s movements of the 1960s would not have been so successful in challenging authority without the bookstores, which made their ideas widely available and sympathetic in a way that television, for instance, did not. That transmission system has now been largely dismantled, killed by high rents and new technology. With little discussion, Amazon has skillfully absorbed a large part of the book trade. It sells about one in four new books, and the vast number of independent sellers on its site increases its market share even more. It owns as a separate entity the largest secondhand book network, Abebooks. And of course it has a majority of the e-book market. The company is a marvel in many ways. You can get almost any print book you want, by the end of the week! And Amazon will pay the postage! For book lovers, it was a dream come true. Amazon presents itself as less a company and more a public utility. One of its greatest accomplishments is the way it has made the future of bookselling seem as if it will inevitably be owned by Amazon. One consequence of this shift is that soon no one will know what a book\u2019s \u201creal\u201d price is. Price will be determined by demand and perhaps by whim. The first seeds of this can be seen in the Justice Department\u2019s suit against the leading publishers, who felt that Amazon was pricing their e-books so low that it threatened their viability. The government accused the publishers of colluding to raise prices in an anti-consumer move. Amazon was not a party to the case, but it emerged the big winner. Perhaps as a result, the question of how Amazon prices books is now a radioactive topic with some publishers. While reporting  my article in Friday\u2019s New York Times , I tried to ask the University of Chicago Press why Amazon seemed to be cutting discounts on its books, effectively making them more expensive and thus possibly less salable. Laura Avey, promotions manager, replied: \u201cThis just isn\u2019t something that anyone here is going to be able to comment on. Pricing questions involve proprietary information, and we just aren\u2019t able to share that.\u201d One of the few publishers willing to speak his mind about Amazon is Dennis Loy Johnson, proprietor of the Melville House, one of the most interesting new presses since its founding in 2001. Melville had an immediate hit last month with a rediscovered article by James Agee,  \u201cCotton Tenants.\u201d   But as sales slow in the days since publication, Amazon is charging more for it. The price-tracking site  camelcamelcamel shows \u201cCotton Tenants,\u201d  which lists for $24.95, moving from $16 on Amazon shortly after publication to $19.79 last week before falling back slightly to the current $19.23. If you were a few weeks late getting the news about \u201cCotton Tenants,\u201d you paid 20 percent more. But it is still cheaper than the neighborhood bookstore, assuming of course there is one left. Right? \u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that there\u2019s one retailer able to so massively underprice other retailers, especially in a business that so desperately needs more retailers,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like the inconsistency of the pricing, either \u2014 the raising, the lowering \u2014 because it sends a confusing message that good books are worth less, and because it encourages buying based on something other than the quality of the book. It\u2019s just an unhealthy business if people are buying a thing mostly because of its price, not its quality. That\u2019s how you sell widgets, not books.\u201d \u201cDiscounting, and especially inconsistent or shifting discounting, really messes with a publisher\u2019s ability to price a book fairly and accurately to its cost,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to consider the fact that whatever price you put on the cover, Amazon is going to reduce it by as much as half \u2014 unless they don\u2019t \u2014 or they may, but only for a while. But in short they\u2019re going to make your book look like a thing with a cost lower than the one you placed on it. \u201cSo do you raise the price, knowing they\u2019re going to lower it, so that the price will then appear closer to what you need it to be? But if you do that then you\u2019re screwing the more honest retailers who can\u2019t discount. And we\u2019ve gotten a long way from recognition of the fact that publishers have costs in making books, and that should have something to do with the price.\u201d Apple and Netflix Dominate Online  Video Amazon\u2019s Diminishing Discounts Amazon Starts a Shopping Site for the Environmental Crowd Questions for Amazon on Privacy and the Kindle Fire Inside Amazon\u2019s Very Hot Warehouse Jim Hollock\u2019s first book, \u201cBorn to Lose,\u201d has been losing momentum, yet Amazon has increased the price by nearly a third. | Jeff Swensen for The New York Times | Jim Hollock\u2019s first book, \u201cBorn to Lose,\u201d has been losing momentum, yet Amazon has increased the price by nearly a third. | Jeff Swensen for The New York Times",

        "name": "Technology Workers Are Young (Really Young) ",
        "content": " It\u2019s well known that technology is a young man\u2019s game. Still, it is surprising to see just how young (and how male). PayScale, a company based in Seattle, has determined that the median age of workers at many of the most successful companies in the technology industry, along with information on gender and years of experience. Just six of the 32 companies it looked at had a median age greater than 35 years old. Eight of the companies, the study said, had median employee age of 30 or younger. Women were generally less than 30 percent of the work force, and in fields like semiconductors, represented much less than that. While the results may affirm a widely held hunch, they are nonetheless striking:  According to   the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the overall median age of American workers is 42.3 years old. The company with the oldest workers on the PayScale list, Hewlett \u2013 Packard, came in at 41 years. The other five companies with older workers, in descending order of median age, were I.B.M. Global Services (38 years old), Oracle (38), Nokia (36), Dell (37) and Sony (36). The seven companies with the youngest workers, ranked from youngest to highest in median age, were Epic Games (26); Facebook (28); Zynga (28); Google (29); and AOL, Blizzard Entertainment, InfoSys, and Monster.com (all 30). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only shoe stores and restaurants have workers with a median age less than 30. Median age means that an equal number of workers are above and below the figure. In large populations, the number is considered representative. PayScale, which surveys many industries, says it covers 3 percent of the American work force, an amount that could yield meaningful results. In this survey, some 21,700 company employees submitted information. Not surprisingly, the companies with older workers tend to be older companies, because some people still stay with one employer for many years, and over time a company may accumulate more of these people. Cisco Systems has a median worker age of 35, and both Samsung and Microsoft come in at 34. These companies also tend to have workers with a lot more experience. Younger companies tend to have workers with less time at the firm, which is partly an effect of being new and hiring intensively in recent years. Facebook\u2019s median worker has been with the company just 1.1 years, while Intel, I.B.M., Oracle and others come in around six years. Other factors are also in play, however. \u201cThe firms that are growing or innovating around new areas tend to have younger workers,\u201d said Katie Bardaro, the lead economist at PayScale. \u201cOlder companies that aren\u2019t changing with the times get older workers.\u201d One reason for this, she said, was a function of skills. \u201cBaby Boomers and Gen Xers tend to know C# and SQL,\u201d she said. C# is a software language, while SQL is a database technology. She added, \u201cGen Y knows Python, social media, and Hadoop,\u201d which are newer versions of those things. Amazon.com, notably, has a median stay with the company of just one year, a figure Ms. Bardaro ascribed to the intense pace of work there. (The study did not include workers in Amazon\u2019s warehouses, where skills and turnover are different.) \u201cWe\u2019re based in Seattle, and know a lot of people at Amazon,\u201d she said. \u201cThe consensus is that you are run through a gamut there, make money, burn out and leave.\u201d The survey was derived from information PayScale gets from individuals who come to PayScale seeking employment information, and volunteer their data to share information from others. PayScale, which works with LinkedIn, sells its data to human resources departments. Ms. Bardaro said her company had also backed up the information with third-party data, to confirm the numbers.

        "name": "Losing Ground on Nook, Barnes & Noble Ceases Its Own Manufacture of Color Versions ",
        "content": " Barnes & Noble conceded on Tuesday that it cannot compete head-to-head with the iPad and the Kindle Fire. Reporting a big loss at its Nook e-reader division that dragged down the company's fourth-quarter results, Barnes & Noble said that it would no longer make its own color tablets. Instead, it will work with third parties, which will make the devices in exchange for co-branding opportunities. The announcement is essentially Barnes & Noble's white flag, signaling that it cannot compete in a market dominated by Apple, Amazon.com and Samsung. It will still make and sell the black-and-white versions of the Nook, which generate the majority of the company's digital book sales. The company plans to discount its remaining Nook tablets through the holidays. ''Our aim is to sell great tablets connected to our best content catalog and high-quality bookstore services we've done, but do so without the sizable upfront risk,'' William J. Lynch Jr., Barnes & Noble's chief executive, said on a call with analysts. The development raises questions about what lies ahead for the embattled bookseller, which remains under pressure from better-financed digital rivals like Amazon. The company's loss of $2.11 a share exceeded the average analyst estimate of 99 cents, according to data from Capital IQ. Revenue decreased 7.4 percent, to $1.28 billion, while the net loss was $118.6 million. Company executives were silent about talks with Leonard S. Riggio, Barnes & Noble's chairman, who has sought to buy the chain's 675 stores. Nor did they discuss the state of talks with Microsoft, an investor in the Nook business that had shown interest in buying the division's digital assets. Talks about possible transactions were still continuing, according to a person briefed on the matter, though it was unclear if or when a deal would be reached. Barnes & Noble has indicated that it will not part with its core retail stores for anything less than $1 billion. Though the company's latest results gave investors heartburn -- shares in Barnes & Noble tumbled 17 percent Tuesday, to $15.61 -- stopping some of the red ink in the Nook unit may help stabilize the business and make it more attractive to potential suitors. And the company can still point to its inventory of digital books as its single most valuable asset, which may draw possible buyers. But the outsourcing of the device manufacturing reflects the difficulties for Barnes & Noble in refashioning itself more in the Apple mold. Introduced in 2009, the Nook was meant to help usher the company into the Internet media age, allowing it to compete head-to-head with Amazon in both devices and digital books. The next year, Barnes & Noble took the even riskier step of introducing a color tablet, the Nook Color, that was aimed more at competing with the iPad. The company introduced ever more sophisticated models, including a 9-inch high-definition tablet. Such was the promise of the Nook that it drew in both Microsoft and the British publisher Pearson, which together bought 23 percent of the business and valued it at about $1.8 billion. And several Nook tablets have won higher praise from reviewers than their Kindle rivals. That has not translated into sales, and the division meant to revive Barnes & Noble has instead weighed down the rest of the company. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the Nook unit lost $177 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, more than doubling the loss from the period a year earlier. Sales fell 34 percent, to $108 million. The company has also had to grapple with the high costs of manufacturing its own devices. Unsold tablets accounted for a $133 million write-down in the fourth quarter and $222 million for the entire 2013 fiscal year. Mr. Lynch outlined some of the expenses involved in supporting its tablet business to analysts. Not only was the company responsible for the hardware, it also invested in developing the software and in marketing the devices. Barnes & Noble's physical bookstores have not fared much better. Fourth-quarter Ebitda at the company's retail arm fell 24 percent, to $51 million, while revenue declined 10 percent, to $948 million. One sign of the company's troubles: the fourth quarter suffered in comparison to the year-ago period, which reaped huge benefits from sales of ''The Hunger Games'' and the ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' trilogies. Mr. Lynch told analysts that while the company opened two retail stores last year, it closed 18. Barnes & Noble will open five locations this year, but will close 15 to 20 existing ones. One brighter spot for Barnes & Noble was its college bookstore business, which had $3.8 million in Ebitda for the quarter on $252 million in revenue. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. Barnes & Noble will still make and sell the black-and-white versions of the Nook.

        "content": " One of the most influential companies in high technology right now may be a 135-year-old industrial stalwart. On Tuesday, General Electric announced software for what it calls ''the Industrial Internet,'' which means the use of sensors, networking technology, and data analysis to better understand and use large industrial processes like electric power production. It is the latest step in G.E.'s push to make the rest of the world's equipment and systems operate more like the Internet. ''The rise of industrial big data is moving at twice the speed of other big data. That's a great opportunity.'' said William Ruh, the head of global software at G.E. ''There's all kinds of experiences that we're going to create.'' One product was an enhanced data analysis framework, based on the Hadoop software used by Internet companies for Big Data analysis. Customers will use it to combine both historic and real-time information to build data-analysis applications to more efficiently manage industrial production. The other is a kind of application software to help power companies figure out how to best build out and operate their turbines. By October, G.E. hopes to have similar applications out for railway, mining, and oil and gas companies. G.E. also announced it is working with Amazon Web Services, offering its products to industrial customers over that public cloud. The Hadoop-based product, Mr. Ruh said, was a first part of a much larger platform for data gathering and analysis that G.E. plans to construct and use both internally and with customers. Effectively, G.E. is taking the data-driven tools and strategies used by Google and Facebook to the much larger global economy. What tracking cookies in a browser do for understanding what Web ads to put in front of you, a turbine rich with sensors and complimentary software will do for better operating an electrical grid. G.E. already manages more than 100 million data-gathering ''tags'' on its products, and foresees putting out far more than that while also collecting sensor data around the surrounding environment. By 2020, GE figures, total spending on the Industrial Internet will be $23 billion. Better management of processes and understanding of systems will yield $1.279 trillion in value, the company said. What G.E. does not yet have nailed is just how its new products will be used. The Hadoop-based analysis tool is for now tied to G.E. products, and the industrial application will be sold as its own product. Late last year G.E. formed a joint venture with Accenture, called Taleris, designed to gather and analyze data from commercial aircraft, for airlines. More recently, G.E. invested $105 million in a company called Pivotal, which is building Industrial Internet software. The different approaches may indicate how big and pervasive a business G.E. considers the Industrial Internet to be. Mr. Ruh called it ''one of G.E.'s top priorities.'' G.E. is not the only company looking to make the rest of the world like a Web company. Cisco Systems is in the middle of an ''Internet of Everyhing'' strategy that involves selling software and services for a world rich in sensors. This is aimed more at things like traffic and water systems than manufacturing, however. Also on Tuesday, Philips announced an open-source competition to speed its product innovation. Phillips is also offering data-gathering connectivity in both its health care and lighting products, hoping to boost the efficiency of things like a patient's medication adherence, or tuning lights to compliment the amount of available sunlight. ''Everybody knows they'll need this technology, but they don't know exactly what they'll do with it yet,'' said Mr. Ruh. He was speaking about G.E.'s customers, but he might also have been speaking about the companies connecting the world, and trying to figure out how best to profit.",

        "name": "Bookshop Memories in a Changing India ",
        "content": " In the summer of 1984, two years before I was born, my father, Ajit Vikram Singh opened a small corner bookshop, Fact & Fiction, in South Delhi\u2019s Vasant Vihar area, opposite a decrepit cinema hall that would screen films like \u2018The Sex Life of Animals\u2019 to a packed audience. Nearly 30 years later, it\u2019s disheartening to see him disillusioned with the Indian book industry. A descendant of a royal family, my father was brought up in old, decadent fashions and with a pet elephant in the house. He got a degree in science from Delhi\u2019s St Stephen\u2019s College, but veered toward the art of curating, collecting, and making a life selling carefully selected books. I grew up in a world unlike his, one filled with books. When I was a baby, he would carry me in a tiny basket to the bookstore. One day, he found me crawling on the floor and sinking my teeth on books lying on the floor. \u201cYou literally grew up biting into the word,\u201d he chuckled. In the early 1990s, I would see my father diligently scan catalogues of international publishing houses, highlighting titles he wanted for the bookstore. He knew where a book in the store was kept because he would stack them himself. \u201cA bookstore isn\u2019t about keeping books you like to read,\u201d he would say. \u201cIt\u2019s about filling it with books that people will want to pick out and buy.\u201d This was perhaps his first lesson in selling books. It was neither a luxurious nor a profitable trade, and my friends at school would wonder how my father managed to pay my school fee. My literary-minded colleagues, however, would imagine the store as a retreat filled with days of quiet reading and fancy thoughts of opening their own bookstores. My father\u2019s days at the bookstore are still punctuated by visits from a bewildering cast of characters, fewer than before. There will be sophisticated gentlemen seeking details of an international best seller; a hassled aunt wanting a birthday gift option for a prodigal niece seeking a \u201cnice\u201d book; a television celebrity hanging around the aisles, hoping to be recognized and drop names of writers she has interviewed; the vague intellectual who proffers instant dismissive reviews of books others pick out while he thumbs through another book he wouldn\u2019t buy; and people with neither the recollection of the title nor the name of the publisher, yet persistently describing a book they want to purchase. Over the years, I\u2019ve watched my father become a solitary man who spends his days manning the store from a squeaky chair behind a tiny desk along with the help of a manager. He knows the regulars well \u2014 writers, scholars, journalists \u2013 who years ago walked into the store as awkward young men and have grown up to be people whose books found a place on his bookshelves. My father shares a unique rapport with them. He knows who reads graphic novels, he knows who seeks philosophy, and he knows who wants science fiction. There are some who make an annual pilgrimage to the bookshop, for whom he\u2019ll disappear into the hidden attic, and fish out a book he has been saving for them. He would even read unpublished manuscripts. In a ruthless, brash city like Delhi, here was an independent bookstore where you could openly talk about literature, religion and politics. Over the years, my father has come to acquire a reputation of being an eccentric bookseller. A few Sundays ago, I was sharing a cup of coffee with him at the bookshop, when a man walked in and asked for the \u201cself-help books\u201d section. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that defeat the purpose,\u201d my father replied. Another time, a man asked him the same question, and he was pointed toward the \u201creligion and philosophy\u201d section. What upsets him is the way people treat books. It bothers him when he sees the corners get turned when someone tries to shove a book back in its place on the shelf without looking. It hurts when people walk in and complain how small the bookstore is and then don\u2019t look at his books. It annoys when people insist on heavy discounts for a $10 book, but wear shirts that would cost $50. Delhi, he often says, is a city with more writers than readers. \u201cBooks are not written because the world needs to read another one,\u201d he once told me a long time ago. \u201cIt\u2019s because writers feel the world must read their books.\u201d We were somewhere in North Delhi at a used bookstore. I was sitting on a pile of books, sipping a cold drink, my hands caked in book dust, wondering how on earth my father had found this decrepit place and why people feel the need to write books. There was a time when my father would skulk around the city, forever on the lookout for old and out-of-print books. He knew every nook and cranny of the city where he could find them and sometimes would take me along on these intrepid \u201ctreasure hunts\u201d. My father would get a lot of leads from the pavement and second-hand booksellers. In turn, he would help them sift through their stash and lend a friendly ear to their troubles. He also had a knack of mending old books, ravished by termites and silver fish, by treating them with spirits, and selling them for a small price. Today, like independent bookstores, the pavement and second-hand booksellers are also finding it hard to keep books and survive. A chain bookstore the size of a food court that opened much later in the same marketplace openly declared that they will have him shut by the end of the year. They couldn\u2019t. In the past few years, independent booksellers like Fact & Fiction around the world are fighting to stay in business. The flurry of chains, online retail, and now e-readers and tablets are gradually edging the corner bookstore out. But the bigger dragon to slay is the skyrocketing rents of commercial spaces in recent times, spitting fire on the ground on which they stand. Had my brother and I been in school today, perhaps my father would not have been able to afford the fees. Many claim there is little or no future for small corner bookstores. But it isn\u2019t books that will suddenly cease to exist if the corner bookstore goes. The glut of shopping malls swelling on the Indian cityscape house outlets of a chain bookstore offering stationery, stuffed toys, DVDs, and books at a discount. Online book retailing is no longer a mere threat. Earlier this month, Flipkart.com sold one million books in a single day. According to a Nielsen survey, it occupied an average 40 to 45 percent share of the book trade in 2013. Vying for the same space is Amazon, which has just entered the Indian market. A day will dawn when a section of readers might miss the experience of walking into a corner bookstore, recognizing a few faces, stumbling upon an unexpected book, long for the civility of a conversation outside a bookstore, crave for a bookseller whose approving smile on the purchase of a copy of Man Without Qualities could be the beginning of a beautiful literary friendship. Few might remember the smell of a bookstore in the morning after the shutters are lifted. And, who would tell me the story a writer confessed about skipping lunch to save enough for a particular book he wanted from Fact & Fiction? A bookstore is a sea of stories. India needs to support its independent bookstores, perhaps now more than ever, for the same reason it seeks to preserve its architectural heritage. I am often surprised how a tiny bookstore in a market dominated by a cinema, garish bars, and garment stores attracted and inspired a generation of writers and scholars. A good bookstore, however, can\u2019t survive on its lore. My father and others who run independent bookstores can no longer get access to the books they were once known for. Their shelves are going barren by the day as they are rejecting the mass-market pulp fiction and the lowbrow offerings the publishers are forcing their way. At a recent literature festival, a popular writer who has sold close to two million copies of a truly mediocre novel was introduced to a renowned novelist. \u201cSo, what do you like to read,\u201d asked the renowned novelist. \u201cActually sir, I don\u2019t like to read. I just like to tell stories,\u201d he answered. For years, my father has been dealing with inept marketing people of publishing houses to keep his selection eclectic. Today they are the ones responsible for bringing books to India and are turning their backs on him. It\u2019s sad because they are only concerned about ordering books in bulk to meet sales margins \u2014 Books that are tried-and-tested, formula-driven drivel, found on international bestseller lists. Books they can\u2019t go wrong on excel sheets. Every day independent bookshops around the world are shutting down. Booksellers like my father are being swept out of the book trade. An evening is not far when books will close on corner bookstores like his and the blues he softly plays will forever stop.

        "name": "Apple trial examines e-mail by Steve Jobs; Executive says message does not indicate firm colluded with publishers ",
        "content": " Just days after Apple introduced the iPad and opened an e-bookstore, the biggest player in the e-book market, Amazon.com, changed the way it sold digital titles. Steven P. Jobs shot off an e-mail to the Apple executive who had negotiated deals with the publishers. \u2018\u2018Wow, we have really lit the fuse on a powder keg,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Jobs, the late Apple chief executive officer, wrote in the e-mail, dated Jan. 30, 2010, to Eddy Cue, the company\u2019s senior vice president of Internet software and services. The e-mail was brought up as evidence during the second half of Mr. Cue\u2019s testimony in a New York courtroom on Monday, where much of the discussion focused on whether Apple had intended to help the publishers raise Amazon\u2019s prices. Mr. Cue testified Monday that Mr. Jobs\u2019s e-mail had not been a memo congratulating him about how Apple\u2019s entry into the e-book market affected Amazon, causing it to switch to a business model called agency pricing, in which the publishers, not the retailer, sets the price of the books. Mr. Cue said Mr. Jobs had been remarking on the company\u2019s ability to \u2018\u2018cause ripples\u2019\u2019 in the e-book industry, which was then largely dominated by Amazon. While Mr. Cue conceded that some e-book prices had gone up as a result of agency pricing, he noted that many titles might not have become available in any digital store at all if Apple had not introduced agency pricing to the market. He said he had learned from his meetings with publishers that they were unhappy with Amazon\u2019s uniform $9.99 pricing for e-books and that they were planning to use a tactic known as windowing \u2014 delaying the release of an e-book until after the more expensive hardcover had been in stores for a while. Mr. Cue testified that both he and Mr. Jobs believed that \u2018\u2018withholding books is a disaster for any bookstore.\u2019\u2019 The U.S. Justice Department was not persuaded. Lawrence Buterman, a Justice Department lawyer, asked Mr. Cue whether he was aware that only 37 e-books had ever been windowed. \u2018\u2018The number doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Cue said. \u2018\u2018What matters is which books. Thirty-seven could be a huge number if it\u2019s the right books.\u2019\u2019 Both parties showed their evidence on a projector screen. Apple\u2019s legal team used a MacBook to shuffle among evidence documents, stacking them side by side in split screens and zooming in on specific paragraphs. In contrast, the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers could show only one piece of evidence at a time. One video that Mr. Buterman played as evidence failed to produce the audio commentary needed to make his point. In its antitrust case brought a year ago, the federal government is trying to cast Apple as the ringmaster that conspired with five big book publishers to raise e-book prices. The publishers have all settled their cases. On Monday, the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers homed in on a condition in Apple\u2019s contracts with the publishers: the \u2018\u2018most favored nation\u2019\u2019 clause, which required publishers to allow Apple to sell e-books at the same price as the books would be sold in any other store. Apple has said that clause existed to guarantee that Apple customers got the lowest e-book prices. But Mr. Buterman argued that it defeated Amazon\u2019s ability to compete on price and that it had left Amazon with no choice but to switch to the agency model while allowing the publishers to raise prices. Mr. Cue said he disagreed. He noted that Amazon had 90 percent of the e-book market before Apple entered the game. \u2018\u2018Amazon could have negotiated a better deal,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018They had a lot more power.\u2019\u2019 Lawyers for Apple and the government spent much of the hearing debating whether the e-mails exchanged between Apple executives and publishers illustrated Apple\u2019s intent to help the publishers force Amazon\u2019s hand. In one e-mail sent to Mr. Jobs, Mr. Cue was reviewing his meeting with the publishers, saying they were interested in solving the \u2018\u2018Amazon issue.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Cue said he was referring to the publishers\u2019 ability to price books above Amazon\u2019s uniform price of $9.99 in the Apple iBookstore. Apple had proposed price caps of $12.99 to $14.99 for new releases. But he said that did not refer to enabling the publishers to force Amazon to raise prices, too.",

        "content": " Now that the video rental store is all but dead (see: Blockbuster), many people are turning to Internet services to get TV shows and movies. By some measures, Apple is No. 1 in online video, but by others, Netflix is leading. Apple on Wednesday  released new statistics   on the videos it provides in the iTunes Store. The company said customers were downloading 800,000 television episodes and 350,000 movies a day. In a recent study, the NPD Group, a research firm, said Apple was by and large  the leader for home video   downloads . For television shows, iTunes accounted for 67 percent of this market in 2012, and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox video service was a distant second with 14 percent of the market, NPD said. For movies, iTunes had a 65 percent share of the market, with Amazon and Microsoft far behind at 10 percent each, it said. Another popular method for watching movies and TV online is paying a subscription and streaming as many as you want. In the subscriptions-based video streaming market,  Netflix is dominant, with a 90 percent share , and Hulu Plus and Amazon are still hardly relevant. To put things in perspective, subscription-based streaming is the most popular method for watching online video. For all the movies watched at home in the first quarter of 2013, 19 percent of consumers watched a movie using a subscription-based service like Netflix, and 5 percent downloaded a movie rental from an on-demand service like iTunes, according to Russ Crupnick, an NPD analyst who follows the online video industry. About 74 percent of consumers watched a movie on a DVD or Blu-ray disc they bought or rented, he said. (The numbers are not mutually exclusive; some people watch movies on Blu-ray, Netflix and iTunes.) Apple, to date, has not entered subscription-based video streaming. Instead, it has teamed up with companies that offer that service. The Netflix and Hulu Plus apps are available on the Apple TV. Apple on Wednesday also announced new partnerships with Home Box Office and ESPN. Coming to the Apple TV are the HBO GO app, which allows HBO subscribers to stream the network\u2019s programs, along with the WatchESPN app, which allows cable TV subscribers to stream some ESPN channels. Apple TV owners can get the apps by downloading a free software update. *   HBO Go, the Best Online Video Service I Cannot Use *   Apple Hopes to Re-enter the Living Room *   A $30 Cable and an iPad on a Television *   Google Asks Secret Court for Permission to Publish National Security Request Data *   Daily Report: Tech Companies Reveal Some Numbers on Requests for Customer Data Steve Jobs discussing the Apple TV in 2010.

        "name": "HGGC Strikes Deal for MyWebGrocer ",
        "content": " As giants like  Amazon.com   move into the online grocery business, an investment firm is betting that a technology company can help traditional retailers fight back. HGGC, a middle-market  private equity   firm formerly known as Huntsman Gay Global Capital, has taken control of MyWebGrocer, a 14-year-old company that provides Web and digital marketing services for brick-and-mortar grocers. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. But people briefed on the matter said the size of HGGC\u2019s investment was on the higher end of its deal range of $25 million to $100 million. HGGC is buying control of the company from the Stripes Group, an investment firm focused on technology and consumer products companies. With the transaction, HGGC is hoping that MyWebGrocer can help clients like  Kroger , Ralphs and smaller grocers fend off incursions by nontraditional rivals. The company claims more than 140 national retailers as customers, providing them with e-commerce services, Web sites and digital circulars. MyWebGrocer, which is already profitable, is expected to report more than $50 million in revenue in its current fiscal year, according to Richard Tarrant, MyWebGrocer\u2019s founder and chief executive. It posted a revenue gain of nearly 60 percent in 2012 from the year earlier. \u201cWe\u2019ve become the digital arm of the brick-and-mortar grocery chain,\u201d Mr. Tarrant told DealBook. It is a space that Amazon and  Wal-Mart Stores   are clearly considering. On Monday,  Amazon expanded its   groceries program   to Los Angeles for members of its Prime service, and the company plans to move into about two dozen other markets through next year. \u201cThe bigger picture is that the industry is driving this direction,\u201d Richard F. Lawson, a managing partner of HGGC, told DealBook. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about delivering groceries. It\u2019s about Amazon.\u201d But he added that unlike Amazon, MyWebGrocer did not need to build out refrigerated warehouse space. Instead, it will draw on existing stores that the company links together with its software. Just as interesting to HGGC is the company\u2019s digital marketing business, including advertising on social media that product makers can use to better focus on customers. Mr. Lawson cited the high valuations placed on e-marketing companies like ExactTarget, which   Salesforce.com  bought last week for $2.5 billion. HGGC is hoping that its latest deal will turn out to be as successful as its investment in Hybris Software, an e-commerce services provider for corporations. Last week,   SAP  agreed to buy that company in a deal reportedly worth more than $1 billion. *   Safeway to Sell Its Operations in Canada *   I.B.M. Buys SoftLayer, a Cloud Computing Firm",

        "name": "In Viacom Deal, Amazon Scoops Up Children\u2019s Shows ",
        "content": " If parents of preschoolers want to plop their children in front of the laptop or tablet to watch \u201cBlue\u2019s Clues\u201d and \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d they may have to join Amazon\u2019s subscription streaming service. On Tuesday, Viacom and Amazon announced an extensive, multiyear deal that includes granting Amazon exclusive rights to Nickelodeon\u2019s preschool shows. The agreement, estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars, is Amazon\u2019s biggest streaming deal yet and signals that the heated battle for online rights has increasingly moved to television\u2019s youngest viewers. In April, Netflix said it would allow its deal with Viacom to expire. Then last month Netflix struck a deal with the Walt Disney Company to gain exclusive rights to stream Disney Jr. series like \u201cJake and the Never Land Pirates\u201d and Disney XD\u2019s \u201cTron: Uprising.\u201d In 2011, Netflix introduced its \u201cJust for Kids\u201d menu with a selection of shows and movies aimed at children, or parents looking to entertain them. That put pressure on Amazon to secure children\u2019s programming for its Amazon Prime subscription service, which it hopes will compete with Netflix and Hulu in the streaming video market. Amazon has a smaller streaming audience than Netflix, but for Viacom the arrangement presents the opportunity to have tie-ins with the consumer products that Amazon sells, like DVDs, \u201cDora\u201d backpacks and \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d beach towels. \u201cThey\u2019re a very consumer driven company and they also connect our Nickelodeon content to products,\u201d Philippe Dauman, Viacom\u2019s chief executive, said in a telephone interview. As part of the deal announced on Tuesday, Amazon also secured the rights to stream shows that are first broadcast on Viacom\u2019s Comedy Central and MTV, including some episodes of \u201cJersey Shore\u201d and \u201cTeen Mom 2.\u201d But the key to the agreement is making Amazon\u2019s Prime Instant Video subscription service the exclusive outlet for pre-school-age children to watch old episodes of shows like \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d \u201cGo, Diego, Go!\u201d and \u201cThe Backyardigans.\u201d Since children do not mind reruns as much as adults do, deals for these types of shows often cost less than series aimed at adults. Bill Carr, Amazon\u2019s vice president of digital video and music, said in a statement that children\u2019s programming was \u201cone of the most-watched TV genres on Prime Instant Video.\u201d In a letter to customers, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, said the deal gave Prime Instant Video more than 250 TV seasons and more than 3,900 episodes from Nick Jr., Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. \u201cWe have increased by 55 percent the number of episodes available to top Prime shows for kids,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote. The deal, he said, added \u201c400 episodes of new shows like \u2018Team Umizoomi,\u2019 \u2018Bubble Guppies,\u2019 \u2018Victorious,\u2019 \u2018Big Time Rush\u2019 and \u2018Drake & Josh.\u2019 \u201d Amazon Prime members pay $79 a year for two-day free shipping, monthly Kindle e-book rentals and video streaming. The company has said it has millions of Prime subscribers but has declined to give an exact figure. Netflix has 27 million streaming subscribers in the United States. Hulu\u2019s subscription service, Hulu Plus, has about four million. In the past, Viacom has had a complicated relationship with subscription video on-demand services like Netflix. After an unexpected ratings drop at its Nickelodeon channel last year, analysts partly blamed a glut of old episodes available to Netflix for cannibalizing the cable channel\u2019s ratings. Children increasingly watch shows via streaming, but revenue from digital syndication deals still does not come close to that provided by advertisers who pay to reach viewers the old-fashioned way. In the quarter that ended March 31, advertising revenue at Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. rose 2 percent as the network rebounded with preschool audiences. Mr. Dauman said a fresh pipeline of shows had improved Nickelodeon\u2019s ratings. As advertising revenue grows on the cable channel, Mr. Dauman has defended deals with digital subscription streaming services as good for both parties. \u201cOur job is to grow the pie,\u201d Mr. Dauman said. \u201cAnd having all these different revenue streams grows the overall pie.\u201d Viacom will need to make an additional $125 million to $150 million in streaming deals in fiscal year 2013 to meet its goal of 10 percent affiliate growth, according to Bernstein Research. Amazon has rapidly built its streaming service to compete with more established services, namely Netflix and Hulu. The Viacom deal is the latest example of the online retailing giant\u2019s swooping in to gain streaming rights after deals with Netflix expire. After Netflix declined to renew its rights to popular cable series like \u201cPawn Stars,\u201d Amazon jumped in. In December, Amazon struck a deal with Time Warner to gain the exclusive streaming rights to TNT\u2019s \u201cThe Closer\u201d and \u201cFalling Skies.\u201d Netflix got exclusive rights to TNT\u2019s \u201cDallas.\u201d Amazon and CBS have a deal that will let Prime subscribers watch \u201cUnder the Dome,\u201d a new science fiction series based on the Stephen King novel, four days after episodes are broadcast on CBS beginning June 24.",

        "name": "I.B.M. Buys SoftLayer, a Cloud Computing Firm ",
        "content": " 3:29 p.m. | Updated I.B.M.   announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to buy SoftLayer Technologies, a cloud computing company, in an effort to strengthen I.B.M.\u2019s position in the fast-growing market for computing sold to businesses as a service delivered over the Internet. As businesses demand more services delivered over the Internet, the titans of technology are stepping up their offerings delivered from data centers afar, so-called cloud computing. I.B.M. made a big move on Tuesday, announcing that it had agreed to buy SoftLayer Technologies, a cloud computing company, in an effort to strengthen its position in the fast-growing market. The purchase price was not disclosed. But it was about $2 billion, according to a person told of the negotiations, who has asked not to be named because he had not been authorized to speak publicly about the terms. The acquisition is the largest made under the leadership of Virginia M. Rometty, who became chief executive in January 2012. The purchase, analysts say, also gives I.B.M. a broader presence in the business of cloud computing services. Amazon   is the leader in the public cloud arena, and its roster of customers includes not just start-ups and research projects, but also large companies like  Netflix . Amazon does not break out the revenue for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, but it is growing fast. The unit had estimated revenue of $2 billion last year, according a recent research report from  Barclays , which forecast that Amazon\u2019s cloud business would reach $5 billion or more by 2014. I.B.M. executives say its strategy is to compete in the public cloud market not with basic computing capabilities like processing and storage, but with software for marketing, procurement and customer service delivered as cloud offerings. Since 2007, the company has spent $4.5 billion on more than a dozen acquisitions to build up its cloud software and services offerings. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on business services that leverage the cloud model,\u201d said Ric Telford, vice president for I.B.M. cloud services. I.B.M.\u2019s first moves in the cloud market date to 2007. But its early emphasis, analysts say, had mainly been on so-called private clouds, in which the computing is delivered to users as service over the Internet, but from data centers owned by I.B.M.\u2019s corporate customers. But the SoftLayer acquisition will sharply expand I.B.M.\u2019s capability to deliver computing services remotely to customers from I.B.M. data centers \u2014 the so-called public cloud model. SoftLayer, a private company based in Dallas, has a network of 13 data centers in the United States, Singapore and Amsterdam, and revenue of about $400 million a year. GI Partners, a  private equity   fund based in Menlo Park, Calif., is the majority owner of SoftLayer. The SoftLayer data centers will be added to the 10 cloud services data centers I.B.M. now has worldwide. Erich Clementi, a senior vice president for I.B.M.\u2019s technology services unit, said SoftLayer \u201ccompletes our portfolio.\u201d It expands I.B.M.\u2019s public cloud operations, he said, while adding expertise and technology for private clouds and hybrid services, which blend the public and private models. Lance Crosby, chief executive of SoftLayer, said his company\u2019s long-term goal had been to become \u201cthe de facto and most flexible platform for Internet cloud computing. And we couldn\u2019t get there on our own.\u201d I.B.M., he said, has the financial resources and relationships with corporate customers to accelerate the adoption of its cloud technology. Beyond the acquisitions, I.B.M. hopes to offer the company\u2019s homegrown technology as cloud services, like its Watson artificial intelligence software, which I.B.M. announced last month was being tailored as a smart customer service assistant. \u201cWatson has a lot more potential because of the cloud delivery model,\u201d Mr. Telford said. Dannon , the yogurt maker, is a cloud services customer that reflects the I.B.M. strategy. It uses I.B.M. public cloud software for optimizing its pricing, promotions and product planning. The cloud software has helped Dannon\u2019s sales planning teams improve the percentage of products sold to consumers to 98 percent from 75 percent \u2014 crucial for a food stuff with a limited shelf life. The software was developed by DemandTec, which I.B.M. acquired last year. In new projects, Dannon, owned by the French company Danone, is now pursuing a \u201ccloud-first strategy,\u201d said Timothy Weaver, the chief information officer. I.B.M. has earmarked its cloud business as an area for investment and growth. That business grew 70 percent in the first quarter of 2013 from the quarter a year earlier. By 2015, I.B.M. has forecast that its cloud business should reach $7 billion, including private and public cloud services. All the major technology companies \u2014 including  Microsoft ,  EMC ,  Hewlett-Packard   and  Oracle   \u2014 are pursuing cloud strategies. But analysts say I.B.M., perhaps more than any other company, can assure corporate customers to feel comfortable putting their business information in remote data centers and buying public cloud services. More than a decade ago, I.B.M. demonstrated that endorsement effect, when it made a big commitment to Linux, the open-source operating system, helping it become a mainstream technology in corporate data centers. \u201cI.B.M. is very much a trusted brand here,\u201d said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at UBS Securities. \u201cOnce they show up, they tend to have a big impact.\u201d *   Cisco to Buy Meraki for $1.2 Billion *   Lenovo to Buy Cloud Computing Company",

        "content": " E-book sales are no longer growing at a nerve-rattling pace. The unpleasant and expensive price-fixing lawsuit last year, pitting the Justice Department against five major publishers, has been settled. Independent booksellers added 65 stores to their ranks in 2012, according to their trade association, despite competition from Amazon. After a turbulent few years in the book business, there was a feeling at  BookExpo America , the publishing industry\u2019s annual trade convention that convened in New York this week, that the disruption might have calmed. \u201cI\u2019m hearing this gigantic sigh of relief everywhere I go in B.E.A. this year,\u201d Michael Pietsch, the newly installed  chief executive   of Hachette Book Group, said in a panel discussion. \u201cWe\u2019re still here. People are no longer quite as anxious that the world is turning upside down.\u201d The event, which ends on Saturday, drew a crowd of 20,000 publishers, authors, agents, bookstore owners and librarians to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The trade show had barely opened on Wednesday when publishing executives who had trekked there began to roll their eyes at the center\u2019s familiar annoyances. \u201cGood old Javits,\u201d Reagan Arthur, the publisher of Little, Brown, wrote on Twitter. \u201cHorrible sight lines, minimal Internet access and $4 Diet Cokes.\u201d But gentle mocking gave way to the usual enthusiasm that permeates the convention, an event whose original purpose was partly to give bookstores the chance to order books for the fall season. It has evolved into something equally old-fashioned: a huge gathering for the book industry to talk up titles, showcase high-profile authors and try to build elusive buzz for promising books. This year, the lineup of celebrity authors included Chelsea Handler, there to promote \u201cUganda Be Kidding Me,\u201d a travelogue;  Helen Fielding , whose third Bridget Jones novel, \u201cMad About the Boy,\u201d is scheduled for release in the fall; and Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d who has written a new novel,  \u201cThe Signature of All   Things,\u201d   her first in 13 years. On the sprawling exhibit floor, publishers big and small rubbed elbows. Near Random House\u2019s mammoth booth, the comparatively tiny  Omnific Publishing   promoted its titles with the slogan \u201cRomance ... Without Rules.\u201d Shadow Mountain, a Utah-based publishing company, advertised \u201cThe Romney Family Table,\u201d by Ann Romney, a collection of stories and recipes offering \u201ca peek inside Romney family life and the food that has become an essential part of those memories.\u201d HarperCollins, pumping up one of its new authors, sponsored a gargantuan hanging billboard advertising a book by Mitch Albom that will be released in the fall. In the autograph area on Friday, fans lined up to meet Rick Riordan, Cassandra Clare and Walter Dean Myers. \u201cWhen you work in a library, you constantly hear that print is dying, and then you come here and feel so much energy,\u201d said Barbara Moralis, a librarian at Northampton Community College in Bethlehem, Pa., as she waited in a long line to meet the author Andrew Gross. \u201cPublishing is not dead.\u201d There were, in fact, several signs of health in an industry that has been buffeted by change in recent years. Oren Teicher, the chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, said unit sales for independents increased nearly 8 percent in 2012. E-book sales, while still growing rapidly in the industry as a whole, have plateaued for some publishers. This provides more stability than the run-amok sales of previous years and gives publishers more clarity about consumers\u2019 book-buying habits. BookStats, a  survey of the industry   released last month, revealed that e-books now account for 20 percent of publishers\u2019 revenues, up from 15 percent in 2011. \u201cIt seems like the growth rate of e-books has slowed,\u201d said Carolyn Reidy, the chief executive of Simon & Schuster. While there was the usual tut-tutting about Amazon \u2014 Becky Anderson, a co-owner of Anderson\u2019s Bookshops, outside Chicago, referred to it as \u201cthe company that shall not be named\u201d \u2014 there was also no booth on the exhibit floor from the New York-based unit of Amazon Publishing, which caused much fear and consternation in the industry when it was founded two years ago. In a panel titled \u201cPublishing, Bookselling and the Whole Damn Thing,\u201d John Sargent, the chief executive of Macmillan, called Attorney General Eric Holder \u201cincompetent,\u201d a comment on the Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Apple and five publishing companies filed last year. Apple,  the only remaining defendant , will go on trial in federal court next week. But Mr. Sargent said the industry seemed to have stabilized. \u201cI was much more pessimistic a year and a half ago than I was now,\u201d he said. The organizers have invited members of the public on Saturday, for the second year in a row, to a \u201cPower Readers\u201d program that is intended to help build word of mouth for books beyond the industry. This year the organizers of the event were expecting 2,000 outsiders, a significant increase over 2012, when 500 attended. Authors, speaking to throngs of starry-eyed booksellers, did their best to rev up the crowds. At a breakfast attended by 1,000 on Thursday, Wally Lamb, the author of the forthcoming novel  \u201cWe Are Water,\u201d   finished his remarks with a paean to booksellers. \u201cWriters and readers are two poles, apart from each other,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you, ladies and gentlemen, are the electricity that connects us.\u201d",

        "content": " Amazon , which has put its foray into original television programming up to a democratic vote, has ordered five series that will be offered on Amazon Prime, the company\u2019s subscription service. The company announced Wednesday that it had selected two live-action comedies and three children\u2019s shows to go forward from the 14 pilots it made available to its subscribers last month and the decisions were \u201cdriven by customer reactions,\u201d according to Roy Price, the director of Amazon Studios. Of course the presence of familiar stars like John Goodman might have helped. Mr. Goodman, well known from shows like \u201cRoseanne\u201d and movies like \u201cArgo,\u201d will star in the most high-profile of the new shows, \u201cAlpha House,\u201d about four unruly Republican senators sharing a house in Washington. It was created by Garry Trudeau of \u201cDoonesbury,\u201d and the pilot features a host of cameos from people like Bill Murray and Jon Stewart. It was a prohibitive favorite to win a series order from the moment Amazon started making the pilots available. Mr. Price noted that \u201cthere had been inclinations\u201d as long as 10 days ago that \u201cAlpha House\u201d had been selected, along with another of the live-action comedy pilots, \u201cBetas.\u201d That one seems especially geared for the audience that might be most attracted to use Amazon Prime: It\u2019s about four friends looking for a big Internet payday by inventing a new social networking app. The other three shows that won the audience feedback derby on Amazon are all shows for children. That means Amazon passed on such ideas as the \u201cOnion News Empire,\u201d a satire of a news network that starred Jeffrey Tambor; \u201cBrowsers,\u201d another Web-based idea about a Huffington Post knockoff, which was a full-on musical created by David Javerbaum (formerly of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d) and starred Bebe Neuwirth (\u201cCheers\u201d); and \u201cZombieland,\u201d an adaptation of the 2009 movie. In that case, the show\u2019s creator, Rhett Reese, tweeted a message saying the hostile reaction from the movie\u2019s \u201cdie-hard\u201d fans \u201chated the show out of existence.\u201d Still, Mr. Price was buoyant about how important viewer reaction was to the whole process. \u201cIt was very helpful and we hope to do it again,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. Mr. Price said the live-action comedies would have \u201cvery similar budgets\u201d to comedies on television networks. \u201cIf you look at the budget of premium cable half-hour shows, these would be right on that mix,\u201d he said. The comedies will produce somewhat fewer episodes, however \u2014 10 more this season for each of \u201cAlpha House\u201d and \u201cBetas.\u201d As for the scheduling, Mr. Price said that was flexible for the moment, with the comedies likely to be available to subscribers starting in \u201clate fall or early 2014.\u201d But Amazon is not committed \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 to the Netflix model of making all the episodes available at the same time. \u201cReleasing them all at once means you are withholding them\u201d as they are made, Mr. Price said, adding that Amazon is seeking to maximize viewer choice. That may mean \u201csome kind of hybrid,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe could start with a few and then roll out the others.\u201d The children\u2019s shows are important, Mr. Price said, because children\u2019s entertainment has been well supported on Amazon Prime and its Kindle service. Driving new subscribers to Amazon Prime is a chief motivator for the company\u2019s expansion in entertainment (Amazon also has 24 movies on its development roster that it intends to test with audiences.) The company charges $79 for an annual subscription that offers streaming of movies and TV shows, access to books and free shipping on eligible items bought on Amazon.",

        "name": "Google's Stealth Cloud Strategy ",
        "content": " Google's strategy to beat Amazon.com and Microsoft in the global business for public clouds is now clear: Swarm 'em. At last week's Google I/O developer's conference, the search giant was at pains to closely tie Google Compute Engine, or G.C.E., its competitor to Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure (and Rackspace, and a host of other public clouds) with Google App Engine, its Web application development service, as well as cloud storage. In effect, Google said it was a way for everyone to build really big businesses. The plan seems to be similar to the way Google got big in search, maps and many other services: make the smallest developers worldwide into allies, and the competition won't even see you coming. ''The power comes from thousands and millions of developers that we don't see,'' said Greg DeMichillie, the product manager for the Google Cloud Platform, which includes GCE, storage and Google App Engine. The strategy has roots in the experience that Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, had from competing with Microsoft. At both Sun Microsystems, where he was chief technology officer, and Novell, where he was chief executive, Mr. Schmidt lost to Microsoft's ability to create a network of software developers who wrote applications for the Windows operating system. When he got to Google, Mr. Schmidt outmaneuvered Microsoft by using the Web the way Microsoft used Windows. Even though Google is now a massive company, it still tries to enlist developers the same way. Google announced last week that App Engine would start to allow development in the PHP scripting language, a software language aimed at writing for broad distribution on the Web. ''Embracing PHP is a great way to lower the barriers to entry'' for developers, said Mr. DeMichillie, a veteran of both Amazon Web Services and Adobe. Thanks to the connection to G.C.E., he said, ''it's on Google App Engine, but it is ultimately scalable.'' Compute Engine and App Engine ''will work together by applications that will become computationally intensive, or require a different function'' that G.C.E. can provide, he said. ''Then it will hand data to App Engine to work with.'' It's intriguing to think of individual developers using Google's systems to reach billions of people, or the number-crunching of supercomputers lashed together from Google's cloud. But competitors are wise to Google's ''up from nowhere'' strategy by now, however. Amazon also made its cloud business as a place where start-ups could buy cheap computing. Microsoft, for its part, is combining its still-popular applications with Azure's capabilities in both computing and machine learning in the hope of bringing powerful new life to its installed base of customers. At first, Amazon's technical resources were hard to use, but the service has become increasingly more accessible, much the way Google adopted PHP. Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S., still has more features than the Google offering. Microsoft, by most reports, is making slower progress. With its monumental size, however, Amazon has also become interested in much bigger clients. On Tuesday Amazon said that its A.W.S. that runs for government agencies now meets security standards that will open it up to even more agencies. Amazon is also in the middle of a global tour aimed at the largest corporations, in addition to start-ups. Google also said Google Compute Engine would move from ''limited preview'' for a few customers to ''open preview'' for everyone. ''Open preview'' is something like the ''beta'' sign that hung on Gmail and other Google services for years. When Compute Engine goes into general availability it will be a sign that Google is supremely confident about the product's reliability, which has been a knock on A.W.S.. ''We are focused on performance,'' said Mr. DeMichillie. ''We will be able to start up in tens of seconds, not minutes, with consistent performance, and cost efficiency.''",

        "name": "Apple Fights Back in Antitrust Case Over E-Book Prices ",
        "content": " Correction Appended WASHINGTON \u2014 Don\u2019t mess with the legacy of Steve Jobs. That is one of several factors that seem to be motivating  Apple \u2019s vigorous defense against a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit accusing the company of conspiring with five of the largest publishing houses to fix prices on electronic books, according to people close to the case. Unlike the five publishers, all of which have settled the case, filed in April 2012, Apple is aggressively disputing the government\u2019s assertions that Apple and the publishers wanted to force Amazon, which controlled 90 percent of the e-book market before Apple entered it, to raise its prices, according to court papers filed this week. A trial is scheduled to begin June 3 in Federal District Court in New York. Among other defenses, Apple says that both Amazon and the publishing companies were already contemplating a move to a different pricing model in 2009, before Apple entered the e-book business. Apple cites one Amazon executive who referred in an e-mail to the idea that Amazon got publishers to accept what it wanted all along as \u201cJedi mind tricks.\u201d Apple, whose 2010 introduction of the iPad corresponded with its opening of a digital bookstore, denies that it tried to convince publishers to enforce a regime that would allow them to set their own retail prices for books, above the $9.99 price that Amazon was then charging. In addition, Apple says that the Justice Department has selectively edited and distorted e-mails between executives of Apple and the publishers. \u201cApple injected much-needed competition and innovation into the e-book business,\u201d said Orin Snyder, a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who represents Apple. \u201cThe DOJ\u2019s case is based on fictions and incomplete quotations. The actual evidence proves that Apple did not conspire to fix prices in the e-book business. We look forward to trial.\u201d The Justice Department accuses Apple of its own selective quotation. And, it said, the evidence shows that the publishing companies threatened to withhold books unless Amazon allowed them to set higher prices and that Apple \u201cencouraged them to do so.\u201d Apple seems particularly peeved about the government invoking e-mails of its former chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, to assert its case, saying the government\u2019s selective editing of those e-mails deliberately distorts Mr. Jobs\u2019s intentions. The government\u2019s court papers quote  from an e-mail   that Mr. Jobs sent on Jan. 24, 2010, to James Murdoch, who as head of News Corporation oversaw its publishing company, HarperCollins. That was three days before the introduction of the iPad, as Apple was furiously negotiating deals with publishers that would allow it to introduce its bookstore on the same day. Apple says the government left out of its papers the fact that Mr. Jobs said Amazon might have the right price for e-books already, at $9.99. \u201cMaybe they are right and we will fail,\u201d Mr. Jobs wrote. Taken in total, Apple said, the e-mail \u201cshows a new entrant with no market power proposing an alternative business model to HarperCollins, and candidly recognizing that Apple has no power to predict or influence other retailers,\u201d Apple said in pretrial papers. Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester who follows the publishing industry, said Apple still has a relatively small share of the e-book market. \u201cEven though they have a big brand, their actions have had relatively little impact on the overall industry,\u201d Ms. Rotman Epps said. Since Apple\u2019s entry, e-book prices have gone down, the company said, with the average retail price of an electronic book falling 63 cents since April 2010, from $7.97 to $7.34. Michael Cader, the creator of Publishers Lunch, an industry publication, said there were multiple ways of interpreting what had happened to e-book prices since the start of Apple\u2019s iBookstore. He said at least part of the decline might reflect the exponential growth in older books, self-published books and books from an array of small and digital-only publishers, many of which are often sold for as little as 99 cents to $3. Edward Wyatt reported from Washington, and Brian X. Chen from San Francisco. Correction: May 18, 2013, Saturday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about Apple\u2019s battle with the Justice Department over charges of price-fixing on e-books characterized incorrectly a comment by Michael Cader, of the industry publication Publishers Lunch, on the decline in e-book prices. He speculated that the growth in older books, self-published books and books from small and digital publishers might account for part of the decline; he did not state that as a fact.",

        "content": " The e-mail, from Steven P. Jobs of Apple to James Murdoch of News Corp., reads as if one old sport were trying to cajole another into joining a caper: \u2018\u2018Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream e-books market at $12.99 and $14.99.\u2019\u2019 According to the U.S. Justice Department, that e-mail is part of the evidence that Apple was the \u2018\u2018ringmaster\u2019\u2019 in a price-fixing conspiracy in the market for e-books, a more direct leadership role than originally portrayed in the department\u2019s April 2012 antitrust lawsuit against Apple and five publishing companies. In its suit, the government said that Apple and the publishers conspired to fix e-book prices as part of a scheme to force Amazon to raise its e-book price from a uniform $9.99 to the higher level noted by Mr. Jobs in the e-mail, which publishers wanted. That, the department said, resulted in higher prices to consumers and ill-gotten profits for Apple and its partners. The e-mail was released Tuesday as part of the government\u2019s filing before the trial in the case, set to begin June 3 in New York. Two days after Mr. Jobs\u2019s e-mail to Mr. Murdoch, HarperCollins, the publishing company owned by News Corp., signed an agreement with Apple to require all sellers of electronic books to adopt the new pricing model, the government said. Apple is the only defendant left in the lawsuit after five publishing companies \u2014 Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon & Schuster \u2014 agreed last year and earlier this year to settle the charges. Tom Neumayr, a spokesman for Apple, said the company had not conspired to fix prices on e-books. \u2018\u2018We helped transform the e-book market with the introduction of the iBookstore in 2010, bringing consumers an expanded selection of e-books and delivering innovative new features,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Neumayr said. \u2018\u2018The market has been thriving and innovating since Apple\u2019s entry, and we look forward to going to trial to defend ourselves and move forward.\u2019\u2019 The Justice Department\u2019s latest filings in the case also paint a picture of an Apple willing to use its power in mobile apps to strong-arm reluctant partners. That is especially evident in the accusations the department makes about Apple\u2019s dealings with Random House, the last major publisher to resist striking an e-books deal with Apple. In July 2010, Mr. Jobs, Apple\u2019s former chief executive, told the chief executive of Random House, Markus Dohle, that the publisher would suffer a loss of support from Apple if it held out much longer, according to an account of the conversation provided by Mr. Dohle in the filing. Two months later, Apple threatened to block an e-book application by Random House from appearing in Apple\u2019s App Store because it had not agreed to a deal with Apple, the filing said. After Random House finally agreed to a contract on Jan. 18, 2011, Eddy Cue, the Apple executive in charge of its e-books deals, sent an e-mail to Mr. Jobs attributing the publisher\u2019s capitulation, in part, to \u2018\u2018the fact that I prevented an app from Random House from going live in the app store,\u2019\u2019 the filing reads. The newly released documents also quote David Shanks, chief executive of Penguin, as saying that Apple was the \u2018\u2018facilitator and go-between\u2019\u2019 for the publishing companies in arranging the agreement. And the documents quote Mr. Dohle as saying that an Apple executive had counseled him that the publishing company could threaten to withhold e-books from Amazon to force Amazon to accept the higher prices. Random House was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The price-fixing suit charges that Apple advised publishers to move from a wholesale pricing model, which let retailers charge what they wanted, to a system that allowed publishers to set their own e-book prices, a model known as agency pricing. The publishers said Amazon was pricing e-books below their actual cost, putting financial pressure on the publishers that they said would drive them out of business. The dispute underscored the extent to which competition from digital retailers like Amazon was transforming the traditional book industry. Three of the publishers, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Hachette, settled with the government immediately. Penguin, Macmillan and Apple originally decided to fight the charges. But in December, to clear the way for its merger with Random House, Penguin settled, followed by Macmillan in February. The settlements call for the publishers to lift restrictions imposed on discounting and other promotions by e-book retailers. The companies are also prohibited from entering into new agreements with similar restrictions until December 2014. The publishers must also notify the government in advance about any e-book ventures they plan with each other, and they are prohibited for five years from agreeing to any kind of so-called most-favored-nation clause with any retailer, which establishes that no other retailer is allowed to sell e-books for a lower price.",

        "content": " Kobo has produced what it said was the highest-resolution e-ink reader, the  Aura HD , which means it should have the best-looking screen, right? This is why you can\u2019t buy devices based on specifications. In a side-by-side comparison, I still preferred the screen of the lower-resolution Amazon Kindle Paperwhite. Not that Kobo isn\u2019t superior in many ways. For one, it allows for more customization. If you go into the menu for fonts, there is an advanced option that lets you adjust the darkness of the type, type size and sharpness of the type. It also offers a sizable selection of 24 fonts. It also has a 1 GHz processor (faster than the Paperwhite), so you shouldn\u2019t get hung up flipping pages. It comes with 4 GB of built-in memory (that\u2019s double the Paperwhite). An additional 32 GB can be added with a Micro SD Card. Like the Paperwhite, the Aura\u2019s adjustable back lighting makes it excellent for bedtime reading. It claims a battery life of up to two months. But to me it has two significant disadvantages. One is the shopping experience. I find it easier to shop on Amazon, which tends to bring in more mainstream authors and applicable titles in my searches than the Kobo store. The other disadvantage is the look of its plain text. Even though the Paperwhite has lower resolution, for me, it\u2019s the easier screen to read. That\u2019s because the background color of the screen, whether using the back light or not, is a lighter color than that of the Aura. It makes the type appear clearer for me. The Aura might be better for publications like magazines that have detailed drawings or photos. But if you want to use a reader for magazines, which are often filled with stunning photography, wouldn\u2019t you prefer a color tablet? Finally, there is the cost. The  Kobo Aura is $170 . The most similar Paperwhite model, which like the Aura is Wi-Fi only, is  $140 . *   Q&A: Controlling Access to a Kindle Fire HD *   Q&A: Reformatting a Kindle Fire *   Q&A: Reading Google Books on an iPhone *   Q&A: Resetting a Kindle\u2019s Automatic Bookmark *   Q&A: Borrowing E-Books from the Library",

        "name": "Kleiner Perkins shifts strategy after stumbling over clean technology ",
        "content": " During the dot-com boom, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital investment firm, all but minted money, making prescient early investments in Netscape Communications, Amazon.com and Google and delivering astonishing returns to investors. Along the way, it became a symbol of Silicon Valley. But the firm has hit a rough patch over the last decade, frustrated by unsuccessful forays into clean technology and by a catch-up effort to take later-stage stakes in social media companies. Kleiner has held a series of status-report meetings with its outside investors this year, acknowledging that recent fund performance \u2018\u2018wasn\u2019t great,\u2019\u2019 one attendee said. \u2018\u2018They really believed green tech was going to be the next big technology wave,\u2019\u2019 that investor added. Kleiner has also cut some management fees and reorganized its investment approach, eliminating three \u2018\u2018silos\u2019\u2019 that separated teams making investments in clean technology, health care and technology. The firm has added more investing partners with digital expertise, like the former Twitterexecutive Mike Abbott, after it missed the early window on hot media start-ups like Facebook and Twitter and jumped in later at higher valuations. A spokeswoman for Kleiner, which manages $7 billion, said the firm\u2019s partners had declined to comment. The latest setback is the fading fortunes of Fisker Automotive, a green-car start-up backed by Kleiner that has laid off much of its work force and hired bankruptcy advisers. At a hearing last month, Republican members of a House of Representatives oversight committee asked witnesses from Fisker and the U.S. Energy Department whether Democratic political contributions and influence from Kleiner partners, led by John Doerr, an adviser to President Barack Obama, had helped Fisker gain $192 million in government green-energy loans. While the questions were clearly partisan, the spotlight on Kleiner added a new level of public criticism to a reputational injury that has been building for several years, denting Kleiner\u2019s status as one of the top technology venture capital firms. Some experts predict that Fisker could become one of the biggest venture-capital losses ever. Fisker has raised $1.1 billion in venture financing, the most for any clean-technology start-up, compared with $848 million for Solyndra, the solar-panel maker that filed for bankruptcy in 2011, according to the Cleantech Group, which tracks such investments. Kleiner investors say that three venture funds the firm raised in 1994, 1996 and 1999 \u2014 which contained Juniper Networks, Amazon and Google \u2014 delivered staggering returns. The 1994 fund delivered 32 times the investors\u2019 money, the 1996 fund 17 times, and the 1999 fund, 6 times. But since then, they note, funds raised in 2000 and 2004 have been unprofitable. A $1 billion fund raised in 2008 devoted to clean technology was also showing losses, one investor said. \u2018\u2018They had stellar returns for years, but their reputation has been tarnished by performance of late,\u2019\u2019 said Nancy Lambert, a former private banker at Citigroup who is now an independent adviser to wealthy families and foundations. \u2018\u2018It doesn\u2019t seem like investors are turning away; they\u2019re just more cautious.\u2019\u2019 Kleiner\u2019s investors have included top universities like Harvard and Yale, the philanthropic Ford Foundation and certain venture capital funds-of-funds. The firm\u2019s reputation was also dented last year when a junior partner, Ellen Pao, filed a sex discrimination lawsuit. She contended that the firm had improperly retaliated against her after she complained about being pressured into a sexual relationship by a colleague, resulting in lower compensation and poor performance reviews. Kleiner has denied all the claims and said that it had chosen not to promote Ms. Pao based on valid \u2018\u2018performance concerns.\u2019\u2019 The shift in Kleiner\u2019s fortunes is emblematic of the venture capital business as a whole, where the titanic returns from the late-1990s dot-com bubble have ebbed, and investor dollars flowing into new funds have slowed as well. \u2018\u2018The days of huge returns in venture are long gone,\u2019\u2019 said Scott Ryles, a longtime Silicon Valley banker who has led two Kleiner-backed companies. Venture funds returned 35.7 percent annually in the decade ending in 2000, but they lost 1.9 percent annually in the decade ending in 2010, according to data compiled by Cambridge Associates for the National Venture Capital Association. As a result, annual commitments to venture funds have fallen from $56.1 billion in the four years ending in 2001, to $17.3 billion in the four years ending in 2012, according to Thomson Reuters data compiled by the association. Founded in 1972, Kleiner scored big early returns on Tandem Computers, a maker of processors used by banks and brokerage firms, and Genentech, a biotechnology start-up whose initial public offering electrified the stock market in 1980. The firm cashed in on a spate of hot Internet offerings, led by Netscape and Amazon, during the dot-com bubble. About five years after the bubble burst, clean technology became Kleiner\u2019s marquee strategy. Kleiner hired Al Gore, the former vice president, soon after his 2006 film about global warming, \u2018\u2018An Inconvenient Truth,\u2019\u2019 won two Oscars. Mr. Doerr, a member of Mr. Obama\u2019s economic recovery advisory board, has advocated for government policies and subsidies favoring clean-technology innovation. \u2018\u2018Going green is bigger than the Internet,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Doerr said in 2007. \u2018\u2018It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.\u2019\u2019 Kleiner has invested in 88 clean-technology companies since 1999, more than any other venture firm, according to Cleantech Group. Those companies include the personal-transport device maker Segway, the fuel-cell developer Bloom Energy and the utility smart-grid provider Silver Spring Networks, which went public in March. In funds raised in 2006, 2008 and 2010, green technology was one of three main strategies, under the aegis of the general partners Ray Lane and Bill Joy \u2014 who have since both become partners emeritus. While still committed to clean technology, Kleiner has played down the sector and sought to make less expensive investments within it. Some of the clean technology bets, like Mascoma, a specialized ethanol start-up, and Sundrop Fuels, a developer of biogasoline \u2014 gasoline produced from biological products like algae \u2014 require plants that cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Pavel Molchanov, a biofuels analyst at the advisory firm Raymond James. In March, Mascoma withdrew plans for a stock offering first filed in September 2011, citing market conditions. The green-technology portfolio has had its share of flops. Think Global, a Norwegian electric-car company, failed in 2011. Kleiner\u2019s investment in MiaSol\u00e9, a solar-panel producer, was wiped out when the company was sold to a Chinese clean-energy company at the end of last year. Plans have stalled for V-Vehicle, a plastic-car company later renamed Next Autoworks, which also had backing from Google Ventures and T. Boone Pickens. Because Kleiner did not invest in earlier clean-technology blowups like Solyndra and Range Fuels, which also received government loans, Fisker presents a new level of public criticism. At the House hearing April 24, Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, asked Fisker\u2019s founder and former executive chairman, Henrik Fisker, about Kleiner\u2019s ability to help obtain government loans. Kleiner Perkins has helped raise \u2018\u2018over $2 million in political contributions in the 2008 election cycle, most of which went to Democrats including President Obama,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Jordan said. He asked if that, or Mr. Doerr\u2019s role as an Obama adviser, had helped Fisker \u2018\u2018to get a loan, get taxpayer money from the Department of Energy?\u2019\u2019 Mr. Fisker denied \u2018\u2018any undue political favors or anything like that.\u2019\u2019 He noted that it was Mr. Lane, not Mr. Doerr, who had served as Kleiner\u2019s representative on the Fisker board. As it focused on green technology, Kleiner lost ground to some rivals like Accel Partners and Greylock Partners, which made early investments in Facebook, which Kleiner missed. The firm seemed to address the issue in late 2010 by hiring Mary Meeker, the former Morgan Stanley Internet analyst known as the Queen of the Net during the bubble. Ms. Meeker has led a $1 billion digital growth fund started in 2011 that has made about 25 later-stage bets including several hot social media start-ups, putting Kleiner in that game, but at higher valuations. While a bet on Facebook is up slightly, its shares of the game developer Zynga are down sharply. Kleiner\u2019s biggest current holding, in Twitter, is valued at more than double Kleiner\u2019s cost, and the fund is up so far over all, a person briefed on the fund said. Some of Kleiner\u2019s later clean-technology investments have a more digital focus, like Nest Labs, which makes smart thermostats; OPower, which offers energy-efficiency strategies for utility customers; and Clean Power Finance, which finances solar-power installations. But one of its largest investments, at more than $100 million, is Fisker. In mid-April, the Energy Department seized $21 million from a Fisker reserve account about 10 days before a scheduled loan repayment. Fisker is seeking new funds. But with its car production stalled since mid-2012, any outcome is likely to shred the value of Kleiner\u2019s stake.",

        "content": " You can tell when a technology is really taking hold. In addition to picking up customers, it generates other businesses that require their own care and feeding. And some of those businesses can illustrate how much more business is out there. On Tuesday, Amazon Web Services is having a meeting for developers and customers in San Francisco. It is the fourth of 12 such meetings Amazon is holding worldwide; the first was in New York on April 18 and the last will be in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, on July 30. In between, Amazon will be in Delhi and Berlin, among other cities. These gatherings will include lots of cheerleading and information from Amazon Web Services directed toward prospective customers and will also have meetings for companies that work closely with Web services on things like databases, security, and application development. About 650 companies are partners with Amazon Web Services, and there are another 723 consulting partners that attract customers looking to tie the unit into their business. Amazon Web Services is growing fast. It has over 1,600 job openings on its Web site and accounted for the vast majority of the $798 million in ''other'' revenue Amazon reported in the quarter that ended March 31. Still, it wants those other companies to be really active on its behalf so it can remain the leader in so-called ''public clouds,'' or cloud computing services for rent. A look at one of the partners, Eucalyptus Systems, illustrates the kind of scale the Amazon service operates on. Eucalyptus provides cloud software that is used primarily for testing big Amazon service projects. That is, even before some companies go on Amazon Web Services, they build mini-Web services clouds. One customer of Eucalyptus, AppDynamics, tests new software for Netflix, the largest customer of the Amazon service. ''Even before their software is on A.W.S., we are categorizing and analyzing over a billion transactions,'' said Thomas Morse, director of information technology and operations at App Dynamics. ''Netflix inflicts a unique kind of pain on a system, with tens of thousands of computing nodes supporting millions of actions a minute.'' Eucalyptus, which began life as an open-source project for people to build their own clouds, moved into supporting Amazon Web Services once Amazon captured such a large share of the market. ''They've got hundreds of thousands of customers now,'' said Marten Mickos, chief executive of Eucalyptus. Because almost all of these customers are companies, he said, ''it is used by millions of people. It gives them meaning for a number of years.'' Last week the data storage giant EMC and its affiliate VMware, which are worried about the Amazon service, announced creation of Pivotal, a company that includes its own Amazon-type cloud. This summer, Google is likely to announce an expansion of its own Amazon Web Services-type unit, called Google Compute Engine. Both Pivotal and Google are working hard on partner networks of their own. Elsewhere, a wealth of consortia with the word ''open'' in their names are looking for their own openings. Many of these companies are heavily backed by older incumbent companies. Mr. Mickos, who sold MySQL, a relational database management system, to Sun Microsystems for $1 billion in 2008, sees the completion as a three-way competition. ''There are the old guys, like IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Cisco, who are trying to get into new stuff,'' he says. ''There are the server virtualization companies, like VMware and Citrix, who say the cloud is just more virtualization of your existing equipment. Then there are the pure plays, like A.W.S. and Google.'' On Monday, Eucalyptus introduced a new version of its product that allows customers to test even bigger projects before they move to the Amazon service. In the future, Mr. Mickos said, the company would look to make its product compatible with Google's service as well. ''It is the most interesting strategic thing we can do,'' he said. ''Amazon is the standard now, Google will compete. There is an old world that won't cross over.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

        "name": "Amazon, Bracing for Strikes in Germany, Plans to Hire Engineers ",
        "content": " BERLIN -- Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, said Thursday that it planned to hire 70 software developers at a new cloud-computing center in Germany as it tried to consolidate its position in the growing field. Werner Vogels, the chief technology officer at Amazon, said the company chose Germany because it was the largest market in Europe and because Berlin was a good source of qualified software engineers and application developers. Mr. Vogels said Amazon's sales of cloud-computing were accelerating in Europe, as technology managers sought to cut costs and were increasingly reassured that sensitive corporate data could stay secure in remote data centers. ''All I can say is we are very happy with the development of cloud-computing sales in Europe,'' Mr. Vogels said during an interview at the cloud-computing conference in Berlin, which was attended by 935 software developers. The engineers would work with a team at Amazon's European headquarters in Dublin but be based in Berlin and Dresden. At the same time, the U.S. tech giant is girding for possible strikes by workers at two of its largest distribution centers in Europe. Amazon employees in Bad Hersfeld who belong to ver.di, a German trade union, voted Monday to authorize a strike. Mechthild Middeke, a ver.di spokeswoman organizing workers at the Bad Hersfeld plant, said 97.6 percent of ver.di workers at the facility had voted to strike. The employees want Amazon to sign a collective bargaining agreement used by some local employers, which ver.di says could increase the annual pay and benefits of Amazon workers as much as a third. Amazon has refused to sign the agreement, arguing that the U.S. company pays workers at levels comparable to other local online retailers, Ms. Middeke said. Ver.di wants Amazon to pay the roughly 9,000 workers at its eight logistics centers in the country as ''retailing'' workers under German law, which would qualify them for the higher pay. Amazon says the workers are ''logistics'' employees, who on average earn \u20ac9.30, or $12.10, an hour in their first year of service and more than \u20ac10 an hour thereafter. ''We will do everything possible should there be strikes to make sure that our customers in Germany are served,'' said Christine H\u00f6ger, a spokeswoman for Amazon Germany in Munich. Ms. H\u00f6ger said that Amazon paid its logistics employees more than comparable German businesses pay for logistics workers. Ver.di members at Amazon's distribution center in Leipzig voted last month to strike. Dates for the strikes have not been set, Ms. Middeke, the union representative, said. She declined to say if her union represented a majority of workers at either Amazon facility. ''A work stoppage will take place in the near future,'' Ms. Middeke said. Ms. H\u00f6ger said Amazon had attempted to reach agreement with ver.di representatives, but had made little progress. ''We had several informal talks with ver.di over the past few weeks,'' Ms. H\u00f6ger said during an interview. ''While we are willing to continue our conversation, we also see too little common ground for negotiations at the moment.'' Heribert J\u00f6ris, the managing director of Handelsverband Deutschland, the main association representing employers in the German retailing industry, said he estimated the chances of a strike at Amazon's facilities as ''very high.'' The employers' association in January canceled a nationwide collective bargaining agreement covering workers at 100,000 retailing businesses, saying it wanted changes in compensation and work practices that date from the 1950s. Employers and unions are expecting to begin negotiations on a new contract within weeks. Ver.di this year organized a strike by workers at Zara, the clothing retailer, and has threatened work stoppages at Globus, a discount chain, Mr. J\u00f6ris said. But in neither case have employers agreed to new wage pacts, he added. ''I'm pretty sure there will be strikes now,'' Mr. J\u00f6ris said. ''But that doesn't mean the strikes will be successful.'' Mr. Vogels, a Dutchman who is based in Seattle, declined to comment on the labor situation at Amazon's retailing operations in Germany. The new engineers would be hired by a division of Amazon, Amazon Web Services, over the next 12 months. The developers would work for a new subsidiary, Amazon Development Center Germany, which would make applications and other software tools for customers of Amazon's cloud-computing business. Amazon offers its European business customers like Royal Dutch Shell; Kempinski Hotels, a chain based in Geneva; and Unilever the option of storing their data in computing centers that it runs inside the European Union to satisfy a law that requires business to handle the data of E.U. citizens within the 27-nation bloc. Jeremy Ward, a senior vice president for information technology at the Kempinski chain, which is majority owned by the sovereign wealth fund of Thailand, is in the middle of a five-year project to shift its corporate computer functions to Amazon's cloud. Mr. Ward said Kempinski was on track to cut its annual I.T. costs by 40 percent as it moved functions like an internal employee telephone directory, training videos and corporate news, currently run by 143 Kempinski servers, into the cloud. ''I think increasingly businesses are dropping their preconceived notions and are beginning to take advantage of the savings in the cloud,'' Mr. Ward said in an interview at the conference.",

        "content": " LEN MARKIDAN, a 26-year-old marketing consultant based in San Francisco, is the type of business traveler who forced LodgeNet, the hotel guest-room entertainment provider, to file recently for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Mr. Markidan, who spends 40 percent of his time traveling on business and is an elite participant in the Hilton and Hyatt loyalty programs, takes his MacBook Pro and iPad with him on the road and watches all television programs by streaming them on his laptop, using a portable router to extend the Wi-Fi signal in his hotel room. ''For a lot of people my age and a lot of people in general, the way we consume entertainment at home is changing,'' he said. ''I no longer have a cable subscription -- the way I watch entertainment at home is the same way I watch it on the road. I have a Hulu subscription, Amazon Prime and Netflix.'' Guest-room entertainment ''is not an amenity that will drive my decision to stay at a hotel,'' he said, adding, ''I'm a lot more concerned with loyalty program perks.'' James Lingle of Highlands Ranch, Colo., a consultant to hotel companies and guest-room entertainment service providers like LodgeNet's competitor iBahn, observed: ''If you look back, typically the first thing a guest would do when they walked into the door of a hotel room would be to turn on the TV. Now people bring their entertainment with them, tablet-based devices like an iPad, accounts and memberships like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, and they want to be able to use them.'' LodgeNet's decline directly reflects these changes. According to its bankruptcy filing, the number of hotel rooms it served globally dropped to 1.5 million in 2011 from 2 million in 2009. It provided guest-room entertainment services to most major hotel chains, usually by installing and maintaining free televisions and offering video-on-demand entertainment, for which it and the hotels received fees. LodgeNet's sales in 2011 were $421.3 million, a 21 percent drop from a high of $533.9 million in 2008. Colony Capital, a real estate and hotel investment firm in Los Angeles, led a group that invested $70 million in a controlling interest in LodgeNet, based in Sioux Falls, S.D., and brought in a management team of former Starwood, Fairmont and Hilton executives. LodgeNet, which emerged from bankruptcy in late March, also signed an agreement with DirecTV to jointly offer entertainment to hotels and hospitals. The revamped LodgeNet faces strong competition from companies including Swisscom Hospitality Services, based in Geneva; iBahn, based in Salt Lake City; Guest-Tek, of Calgary, Alberta; and Roomlinx, based in Broomfield, Colo. All are developing systems that let travelers consume entertainment the way Mr. Markidan does -- via the Internet, frequently through subscriptions they already have and use at home, either through Wi-Fi or a direct cable connection between their laptop or tablet and the guest-room television set. Different types of hotels have different policies regarding Internet access. Many less expensive hotels offer it free, while more expensive ones often charge for it. What's expected to happen next, speaking broadly, is that using the Internet for e-mail will be free, while many hotels will charge for uses requiring a lot of bandwidth, like downloading or streaming videos, with the cost tied to the amount of bandwidth required. ''We will give customers more short-form content at very attractive prices, affinity packages of sports channels, just-missed TV, video games, as well as movies currently in theaters,'' said Michael Ribero, Lodgenet's new chief executive. ''We want to give them the opportunity to watch what they want, even if it's through Netflix and Amazon Prime.'' He said LodgeNet will no longer provide television equipment in hotel guest rooms in exchange for video-on-demand fees. Instead, DirecTV will offer hotel owners lease financing for TVs, freeing capital that LodgeNet can invest in product and service improvements. C. Scott Hansen, director of guest technology for Marriott International, said his company's objective over the next several years was to connect every guest-room TV to the Internet. Marriott International also plans to limit the number of TV channels its brands offer to a targeted, all-high-definition lineup and to augment these with Internet-based, streaming content, via services like Netflix and YouTube. Bandwidth capacity at many Marriott International hotels will need to be increased to support these services, an expense Mr. Hansen said would be offset by guests' purchases of Internet access, commissions paid by services like Netflix for signing up new members and advertising revenue from companies that could use the TV or guest's laptop or tablet screen for messages. Josh Weiss, vice president of brand and guest technology for Hilton Worldwide, said his company offered a broad range of short, low-price TV programs, similar to those available from Netflix or iTunes, in many hotels, provided by LodgeNet and others. This content costs $2 to $5, far less than a full-length movie. Hilton Worldwide also offers a free, DirecTV service similar to DirecTV's residential service at over 150 hotels across most of its brands and plans to expand this service this year. Mike Blake, chief information officer of Commune Hotels and Resorts, said the company was considering keeping track of guests' channel preferences, which would automatically come up whenever a guest turned on the TV in the hotel room. He said this service, which guests could opt in for, should be available by the fourth quarter of this year. Other new services under consideration include the ability to customize music playlists for guests and to stream personal photos on guest room TVs. Apple TV in hotel rooms at the Aloft Cupertino, a Starwood hotel, lets guests play video and music and display photos from any Apple device on their television set. Starwood is evaluating offering this system and additional entertainment options at other Aloft and Starwood hotels. CitizenM, a Dutch chain of what it calls ''affordable luxury'' hotels -- now all in Europe, with two slated to open in Manhattan this year and next -- provides a Samsung tablet in each guest room, with technology from Swisscom that provides a music library and free video-on-demand TV and also controls the blinds, lighting and temperature. The 85-year-old Peninsula Hong Kong this month will finish installation of a guest-room entertainment system that Ingvar Herland, Peninsula Hotels' general manager of research and technology, said costs $10,000 to $25,000 a room. This proprietary system features fully customizable bedside and desk tablets preset in a choice of five languages, with six more to follow this year. The tablet allows the guest to order room, concierge and housekeeping services, and to control lighting, curtains, the temperature and privacy options. It also provides -- via a flat-screen, Blu-ray, LED television -- terrestrial programming, 90 international television channels, 450 Internet radio stations, free HD and 3-D movies, as well as free international voice-over-Internet protocol telephone calls. Mr. Herland said the new system would be offered at the Peninsula Paris, opening next year, and would eventually replace existing systems at other Peninsula hotels. Travelers should not expect a proliferation of new services like the Peninsula's, said Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. He said that although hotels in the United States this year were expected to spend a record percentage of profits on capital expenditures -- like entertainment systems -- profits per room also were expected to remain well below their 2006 peak. Companies offering new systems ''that are expensive for hotel owners are doing so at a challenging time,'' he said, adding that many hotel owners would consider premium cable service as an alternative. One vanishing option is sex-related entertainment. Omni banned such programs in 1999, citing its support of ''pro-family issues,'' while Marriott International stopped offering it last year. ''If you want it, you can access it online on your own,'' said Mr. Hansen of Marriott.

        "content": " CORRECTION APPENDEDAnita Demetropoulos, a Maine shopkeeper, figured she would never see the day when her most relentless competitor, Amazon, would be forced to collect sales tax. Now that Congress seems ready to do that, she is no longer sure it matters. Even in losing, the e-commerce powerhouse is triumphant. It no longer needs the tax break to vanquish its foes -- and could even make money by collecting the new taxes for other retailers. ''I'm surprised and glad this is happening,'' said Ms. Demetropoulos, who owns three toy stores with her husband. ''But Amazon won't rest until it gobbles up everyone and everything.'' The Senate is poised to pass a bill to require all but the smallest online sellers to collect the tax. The House appears likely to follow suit. Although Amazon's desire to avoid the tax played a fundamental role in its founding and growth, it is a supporter of the legislation. As it builds new warehouses and extends its already considerable reach, Amazon is relying less on price than speedy delivery, free shipping and a selection that encompasses just about everything. Small retailers say Amazon was always a significant opponent, and is now a fearsome one. ''It's beyond frustrating that Congress waited until Amazon became so dominant that having a massive tax advantage is no longer essential to its strategy,'' said Stacy Mitchell, a senior researcher with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. ''The right time to fix this was a decade ago, when it could have saved many local businesses.'' Analysts who closely follow the fortunes of Amazon say collecting taxes is unlikely to drive away its customers. They say it may even help the Seattle company while simultaneously defusing a potent political issue. In the few states where the company has already begun collecting, said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, sales dip for about a year. ''Then the customers come back for the convenience and selection,'' he said. Figuring out the tax in thousands of jurisdictions could be a logistical nightmare for merchants just above the legislation's threshold of $1 million in annual out-sf-state sales. That is another place where Amazon is expected to benefit; it could sell tax collection services to tens of thousands of third parties. For some store owners, the digital world's momentum can seem overpowering. Ms. Demetropoulos tried to sell specialty toys online, but business dwindled as Amazon sought out her competitors and signed them up to sell through its Web site. The company courted her as well. ''I'm like, 'Are you kidding?' '' she said. Customers come into one of the branches of Island Treasure Toys, she said, scan a toy on their smartphone, and inform the sales clerk that Amazon sells it cheaper. Would the store be willing to make a deal? The tax will not help this situation much, which is regularly played out in all kinds of stores across the country. If retailers say no, Amazon often gets the business. Amazon reported this week that its first-quarter revenue rose 22 percent, to $16.07 billion, an amazing increase for a retailer of its size. Wal-Mart, by contrast, is expecting no sales growth at all this quarter. ''This is the moment when Internet commerce was finally forced to stand on its own two feet,'' said Michael Mazerov, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who wrote the definitive report on Amazon's long-held intransigence on the issue. ''But it's coming very late in the game.'' Under the current system, an Internet company has to collect taxes only in states where it has a physical location. For most companies, that means the state in which it has its headquarters. When Jeff Bezos had the idea for Amazon in the mid-1990s, he explored setting up shop on a tax-free Indian reservation. Foiled in that goal, Mr. Bezos chose the State of Washington, which had an abundance of software programmers but a relatively small population. ''It made no sense for us to be in California or New York,'' he explained in an unguarded 1996 interview. For years, Amazon rejected the notion that it should collect money in states where it had no employees. ''It's not fair,'' Mr. Bezos told stockholders in 2008. Consumers are supposed to add up their Internet purchases and pay the appropriate tax directly to their state revenue collectors. In practice, however, few do, and enforcement is minimal. In recent years, states struggling in the recession became more aggressive toward Amazon. Texas, New York and California all pursued the company over the tax issue. Amazon began making deals to collect the tax while simultaneously building warehouses that would bring it closer to its customers, bringing same-day delivery within reach. Andy Ross, the former owner of Cody's, the famous Berkeley bookstore that went out of business in 2008, sees ''a little irony'' in these developments. ''As always, Amazon is nimble enough to make lemons out of lemonade,'' said Mr. Ross, who was regularly outraged by the tax issue when he was competing against the e-commerce company. ''But there is no question that the free ride it received for 18 years on the sales tax issue gave it a huge competitive advantage.'' Last August, an Amazon executive testified before Congress that all ''sellers should compete on a level playing field'' and that the states really needed the tax money, which was estimated to be more than $10 billion annually. When the Senate introduced the legislation in February, Amazon wrote to the sponsoring senators to thank them. Thomas J. Szkutak, Amazon's chief financial officer, dismissed any ill effect from legislation, telling reporters this week that ''certainly we'll continue to have a good business in those states.'' EBay, Amazon's close competitor, has fought the bill, saying the threshold to collect the tax should have been substantially higher than $1 million in revenue. For some eBay sellers, the legislation is less about leveling the playing field than permanently tilting it against them. ''This is all about the big Internet companies -- Amazon, Walmart -- crushing the small companies,'' said Chris Chapman, who sells winter sports equipment on eBay, Amazon and through his own Web site, SnowSportDeals.com. His sales are slightly over the threshold. That means Mr. Chapman, who is based in Maryland, will either have to spend many hours figuring out how to collect taxes himself or pay someone to do it for him. ''This will make it harder for people like me to start a Web business,'' Mr. Chapman said. ''So Amazon will just get more customers. It's win-win for them.'' Correction: May 2, 2013, Thursday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the likely passage of a federal bill to require some online retailers to collect out-of-state sales tax described incorrectly which retailers would be required to collect the tax.

        "content": " Amazon created the Kindle to breathe life into electronic books. Now it is preparing a device to bring Internet video to television sets. The company is developing a television set-top box and has begun discussions with outside providers of content about distribution of their video services to the device, according to three people briefed on the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Amazon product had not yet been announced and it remained confidential. Amazon is planning to introduce the set-top box this autumn, one of these people said. Bloomberg Businessweek first reported news of Amazon\u2019s plans Wednesday. Kinley Pearsall, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment. It was not immediately clear why Amazon would bother designing its own set-top box. The device will most likely showcase Amazon\u2019s own online video offerings, which include Prime Instant Video, a Netflix-like subscription video service with more than 40,000 movies and television episodes that is included as part of Amazon\u2019s broader Prime membership. Among other benefits, Prime members, who pay $79 a year, get free two-day shipping on orders bought through Amazon\u2019s site. Amazon also offers a broader library of video content, totaling 150,000 titles, that anyone, including people who are not Prime members, can buy and rent. But Amazon\u2019s video services are already available on hundreds of devices, many of which connect to television sets, like game consoles, digital video recorders and Blu-ray players. An app for using Amazon\u2019s video service is even embedded in some television sets, including models from Sony, Panasonic and Samsung. Although Amazon was an early entrant in the e-reader market with the Kindle, the company is late to the market for set-top boxes, where the incumbents include Apple\u2019s Apple TV device and a family of products from Roku. Amazon, though, has considerable strengths and has shown an aptitude for reinventing itself in new categories, like cloud computing and tablet computers. One media executive who has participated in discussions with Amazon about its set-top box said he thought the company\u2019s standing as a top shopping destination would allow it to promote its new device and give it a strong chance of attracting an audience. The company could use other creative techniques for getting its set-top box into more living rooms. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said one approach that could make sense was for Amazon to sell the device for $100 or less, about what Internet set-top boxes cost today, and to include a free year of its subscription video service. At the end of the term, customers would have an incentive to sign up for Amazon Prime to continue receiving all of its membership benefits, including the video service. \u2018\u2018I think this is a Trojan horse to get people to join Prime,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Pachter said.",

        "name": "Amazon\u2019s Profit Falls as It Spends Heavily on Projects ",
        "content": " SEATTLE \u2014 Profits at  Amazon   are like a tributary that dries up for extended periods of time, while the company diverts them into any number of ambitious new projects intended to ensure a lush future. On Thursday, Amazon told investors it\u2019s still not time for a drink. The Internet retailer reported a  37 percent decrease in profits   for the first three months of the year. That drop was expected, and it was even a bit less than some investors had forecast, which initially helped lift the company\u2019s shares slightly in after-hours trading. The stock eventually ended up falling about 3 percent in after-hours trading. Amazon said its net income for the first quarter, which ended March 31, fell to $82 million, or 18 cents a share, from $130 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 22 percent to $16.07 billion from $13.18 billion. While the company\u2019s profit was better than analysts had expected, its revenue fell slightly short. Wall Street analysts expected Amazon to report earnings of 9 cents a share and revenue of $16.16 billion, according to an average of their estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. Amazon previously told analysts to expect its sales to grow to between $15 billion and $16.6 billion, or somewhere from 15 to 26 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s more of the same from Amazon,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company. Mr. Sebastian added that the waves of investments that Amazon was making were unlikely to abate soon. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a continuing trend,\u201d he said. The seeming indifference of many investors to Amazon\u2019s slim profits shows how much more effective the company has been at articulating its vision of future opportunities to Wall Street than another tech favorite, Apple. Apple, which made a profit 116 times bigger than that of Amazon last quarter, has been plagued by investor doubts about its growth prospects, driving its stock down 33 percent over the l ast year. Amazon\u2019s shares are up 38 percent in that period. Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said investors had been reassured by comments from Amazon management that suggested the company was not being hurt as much by weakness in European economies as another e-commerce giant, eBay. \u201cThat\u2019s an acknowledgment that the growth outlook for Amazon remains quite robust,\u201d he said. Amazon is spending heavily on fulfillment centers to speed delivery of physical goods to customers. It is also investing aggressively in data centers to expand its Amazon Web Services business, which provides start-ups and big corporate clients with computers and bandwidth they can rent as needed for their online initiatives. Then there are the consumer devices that are becoming an increasingly important part of Amazon\u2019s plan to deliver media electronically to customers. The company\u2019s Kindle e-readers are now a full-blown family of tablet computers, which it sells for little or no profit, with the goal of making money over the long term by selling books, movies, music and other services. Amazon is also  developing   a television set-top box that it is expected to announce in the fall, a device that could give its video services a more meaningful audience in living rooms. The company recently introduced pilot episodes for 14 original comedy and children\u2019s television shows and is soliciting viewer feedback to determine which ones will be turned into full series. In a conference call, Tom Szkutak, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, repeated an oft-stated Amazon motto about its priorities. \u201cWe believe putting customers first is the only way to create lasting value for shareholders,\u201d he said.",

        "name": "An Uncertain Lure for Samsung\u2019s Digital Store ",
        "content": " With the release of  Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S4 smartphone   this weekend, the company will open a digital store that offers music, video, games and books. But even though Samsung is the biggest seller of phones in the world, it\u2019s far from certain that its store will pose a serious challenge to those run by Apple, Amazon and Google. Inside the store, called  Samsung Hub , customers will be able to flip through content in a magazinelike format. For music, for example, users can find and download songs and upload their own music library to an online locker, where Samsung will scan and match the library with songs in its own catalog so users do not have to repurchase them. (That\u2019s similar to Apple\u2019s matching service, iTunes Match.) Although Samsung has found success selling devices and accessories, it has little experience in e-commerce, and technology reviewers have said it is especially  weak in designing software . It\u2019s uncertain whether people will feel confident about buying digital content through a Samsung store. \u201cThey are less strong than Apple or Google when it comes to content, media, applications, getting developers to write applications,\u201d said Charles Golvin, a mobile analyst at Forrester Research. Mr. Golvin said that Samsung was at a disadvantage because it was opening its store long after the competition. And its top rivals have particular strengths: Apple\u2019s iTunes Store is extremely successful with music, Amazon dominates the e-book business and Google Play has become a vibrant destination for downloading Android apps. Consumers make investments of time and money in ecosystems that make it harder for them to leave a company\u2019s products, Mr. Golvin said. For example, people who bought a lot of books from Amazon for a Kindle device will be unlikely to want to buy e-books elsewhere. \u201cIf you\u2019re a glass-half-full person, it\u2019s loyalty, and if you\u2019re a glass-half-empty person, it\u2019s lock-in,\u201d Mr. Golvin said. \u201cIn order to secure the greatest possible loyalty or lock-in, you need all of those components working in your favor.\u201d Samsung\u2019s relationship with Google in particular is growing more complicated by the day, Mr. Golvin said. \u201cGoogle is to some extent reliant on Samsung as the dominant seller of Android phones,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, Samsung is reliant on Google for the larger Android ecosystem, people building Android apps and delivering them through Play.\u201d Samsung Hub will be a direct competitor to Google Play. Mr. Golvin said either company\u2019s next move could be equally competitive. Samsung could strike out on its own, using a platform called Tizen instead of Android. Or Motorola, owned by Google, could make Android phones that rival Samsung\u2019s. *   Google Buys E-Commerce Company to Improve Shopping Search *   Do People Actually Shop on Phones?

        "content": " SEATTLE \u2014  Amazon   created the Kindle to breathe life into electronic books. Now it is preparing a device to bring Internet video to television sets. The company is developing a television set-top box and has begun discussions with outside providers of content to distribute their video services to the device, according to three people briefed on the plan, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the Amazon product had not yet been announced and remained confidential. Amazon is planning to introduce the set-top box in the fall, one of these people said. Bloomberg Businessweek first  reported news of Amazon plans   on Wednesday. Kinley Pearsall, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment. It was not immediately clear why Amazon would bother designing its own set-top box. The device will most likely showcase Amazon\u2019s own online video offerings, which include Prime Instant Video, a Netflix-like subscription video service with more than 40,000 movies and television episodes that is included as part of Amazon\u2019s broader Prime membership. Among other benefits, Prime members, who pay $79 a year, get free two-day shipping on orders bought through Amazon\u2019s site. Amazon also offers a much broader library of video content, totaling 150,000 titles, that anyone, including people who aren\u2019t Prime members, can buy and rent. But Amazon\u2019s video services are already available on hundreds of devices, many of which connect to television sets, like game consoles, digital video recorders and Blu-ray players. An app for using Amazon\u2019s video service is even embedded in some television sets, including models from Sony, Panasonic and Samsung. Although Amazon was an early entrant in the e-reader market with the Kindle, the company is late to the market for set-top boxes, where the incumbents include Apple\u2019s Apple TV device and a family of products from Roku. Amazon, though, has considerable strengths and has shown an aptitude for reinventing itself in new categories, like cloud computing and tablet computers. One media executive who has participated in discussions with Amazon about its set-top box said he thought the company\u2019s standing as a top shopping destination would allow it to promote its new device and give it a strong chance of attracting an audience. The company could use other creative techniques for getting its set-top box into more living rooms. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said one approach that could make sense was for Amazon to sell the device for $100 or less, about what Internet set-top boxes cost today, and to include a free year of its subscription video service. At the end of the term, customers would have an incentive to sign up for Amazon Prime to continue receiving all of its membership benefits, including the video service. \u201cI think this is a Trojan horse to get people to join Prime,\u201d Mr. Pachter said.

        "content": " It is America\u2019s first fully interactive national tragedy of the social media age. The  Boston Marathon   bombings quickly turned into an Internet mystery that sent a horde of amateur sleuths surging onto the Web in a search for clues to the suspects\u2019 identity. And once the search focused on Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the brothers\u2019 social media postings provided a rich vein of material to mine and sift. There are more than a thousand messages on Dzhokhar\u2019s  Twitter account   in addition to a  profile page   on VKontakte, a popular Russian social networking site, and in Tamerlan\u2019s case, a list of  favorite videos   on YouTube and what appears to be an Amazon  wish list   belonging to him (Amazon would not confirm whose list it was, citing its privacy policy.) These posts instantly became dots that people began trying to connect. Some details ratified the views of those former friends and neighbors who said they were utterly shocked at the brothers\u2019 possible involvement in such a horrifying crime. Other posts pointed to Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u2019s growing interest in Islamic radicalism and possibly a dark subtext to the friendly, boy-next-door affect of Dzhokhar. At the same time, they were reminders of the complexities of online identity \u2014 of the ways in which people strike poses and don masks on the Web (which can sometimes turn into self-fulfilling prophecies), and the ways in which the Web can magnify or accelerate users\u2019 interests and preoccupations. The younger brother, Dzhokhar, in particular, seemed utterly immersed in American pop culture, and concerned with the sorts of things that preoccupy many young men \u2014 girls (\u201cmiss u.s.a. is so sexy\u201d) and good times (\u201cI am the best beer pong player in Cambridge. I am the #truth\u201d). In fact, much of his Twitter feed is distinctive only in its ordinariness \u2014 ordinariness that stands in such startling contrast to the horror of what happened last week in Boston. There are lots of references to musicians like Chris Brown, Jay-Z and Michael Jackson; television shows like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d and movies like \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cFinding Nemo.\u201d He prattles away about Nutella and Frosted Flakes, complains about typos and losing his remote. \u201cPop-up adds are the worst, on par with mosquitoes,\u201d he tweets on June 17, 2012. Given the layers of irony, sarcasm and joking often employed on Twitter, it can be difficult to parse the messages of a stranger. Yet some of them can seem menacing or portentous, given what we now suspect: \u201ca decade in america already, I want out,\u201d \u201cNever underestimate the rebel with a cause\u201d or, drawing from lyrics from a Kendrick Lamar song, \u201cNo one is really violent until they\u2019re with the homies.\u201d But others suggest a more Holden Caulfield-like adolescent alienation: \u201csome people are just misunderstood by the world thus the increase of suicide rates.\u201d Sometimes, Dzhokhar sounds downright sentimental (unless, of course, he is being ironic): \u201cThere are enough worms for all the birds stop killing each other for \u2018em.\u201d Parts of Dzhokhar\u2019s VKontakte page are harsher and more serious. Under personal priority, it says \u201cCareer and money.\u201d Under worldview, it says \u201cIslam.\u201d There is a link to a video indicating outrage at the violence in Syria, and a link to an Islamic Web site that says \u201cAnd do good, for Allah loves those who do good.\u201d Another video features a blind boy talking to an older man, saying he believes his blindness will be absolved on Judgment Day; the man starts to cry, and wonders how many people who have their sight are as committed to the study of the Koran as the boy. Other posts on Dzhokhar\u2019s page have a more sardonic edge. There is a link to a self-described \u201cjournal of sarcasm\u201d called \u201cEvil Corporation\u201d (featuring a logo reminiscent of Angry Birds) and also a joke that goes like this: \u201cA car goes by with a Chechen, a Dagestani and an Ingush inside. Question: Who is driving?\u201d Answer: The police. The videos linked to on Tamerlan\u2019s YouTube page \u2014 created in August 2012, shortly after a trip to Russia \u2014 are far more militant, and hint at a growing radicalization. About seven months ago, he posted a couple of videos of Timur Mucuraev, whom The Washington Post has called \u201cthe bard of Chechen separatism.\u201d Five months ago, he posted a video (subsequently deleted) under the subheading \u201cTerrorists.\u201d The video featured a militant named Abu Dujana (a k a Gadzhimurad Dolgatov), who was killed by Russian security services. The video shows the leader in sunglasses, flanked by two others, their faces hidden by balaclavas, brandishing automatic weapons. Four months ago, a link went up on Tamerlan\u2019s YouTube page to a video called \u201cThe Emergence of Prophecy: The Black Flags from Khorasan.\u201d The black flags refer to a kind of Armageddon-like prophecy reportedly embraced by Al Qaeda \u2014 about jihadis rising up from Central Asia to defeat the infidels. A video link featuring the radical Islamic preacher Feiz Muhammad has been removed in the past several days; it included a denunciation of the  Harry Potter   books and movies as glorifying \u201cpaganism and evil\u201d and teaching \u201cchildren the drinking of unicorn blood and magic.\u201d As for what appears to be Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u2019s Amazon wish list page, it is a weird jumble of self-help books (Dale Carnegie\u2019s \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u201d), covert-operations-style manuals (\u201cThe I.D. Forger: Homemade Birth Certificates and Other Documents Explained\u201d), Chechen history books (\u201cAllah\u2019s Mountains: The Battle for Chechnya, New Edition\u201d), Mafia books (Nicholas Pileggi\u2019s \u201cWiseguy\u201d) and books about the Roman Empire (\u201cThe Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\u201d). There is Boethius\u2019s \u201cConsolation of Philosophy\u201d \u2014 a staple of college curriculums that addresses ideas of good and evil and free will \u2014 and \u201cSnatch,\u201d the \u201cinside story of the making of the smash-hit movie starring Brad Pitt.\u201d Did Tamerlan harbor macho dreams of being an action hero, or a Mafia operative? Did he want to read Boethius to grapple with deep existential doubts he was having, or was he assigned it in school? (The books all appear to have been added to the Amazon list in 2006 and 2007.) Did his interest in the Roman Empire have something to do with a conviction that the West was decadent and in decline? For that matter, does this Amazon wish list really belong to him? Or does our fascination with the list simply reflect our own desire to gain insight into his thinking, our hunger for more dots to try to connect? Indeed, online and off-line conversations around the nation last week were filled with hypotheses, theories and deconstructions as to why the Tsarnaev brothers might have committed the terrible acts they are suspected of. There were shrewd Nancy Drew-like insights, dangerous red herrings (which hurt some innocent people and underscored the dark side of crowd-sourcing and the mob mentality that can infect the Web) and silly speculation. People drew analogies between the Tsarnaevs and such varied siblings as the twins in the David Cronenberg film \u201cDead Ringers,\u201d the title characters in Dostoyevsky\u2019s \u201cBrothers Karamazov,\u201d and the Corleones in \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d A Twitter message posted by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hours after the marathon bombings (\u201cAin\u2019t no love in the heart of the city, stay safe people\u201d), prompted some amateur detectives to wonder if that reference to Jay-Z\u2019s song \u201cHeart of the City (Ain\u2019t No Love)\u201d is a direct allusion to 9/11, since the album containing that song was released on Sept. 11, 2001. America has processed the Boston Marathon bombings in different ways from the terror attacks of 9/11 \u2014 in part because the level of digital sophistication has grown so exponentially since then (in 2001, there was no YouTube, no  Facebook , no Twitter). The social media droppings the Tsarnaev brothers left behind not only attest to their own immersion in the interactive, electronic world, but they have also provided everyone else with plenty of digital data from which to try to extract patterns and possible meaning \u2014 fulfilling that very human need to try to make narrative sense of the tragic and the overwhelming.

        "name": "Comparing the Valuations Behind Amazon and Apple Shares ",
        "content": " And people wonder why it\u2019s hard to understand the stock market. Take a consumer sitting at home buying stuff on  Amazon.com   with his iPhone. To him,  Apple \u2019s product is a clear leader in the market, while Amazon is the retailer he uses most. Amazon\u2019s shares are up nearly 40 percent over the last 12 months, while Apple\u2019s are down nearly 30 percent over the same period. So why have their stock prices diverged so much when both companies appear to be at the top of their game? Growth is the most common answer you will hear. When a company convinces investors that its earnings can keep going up, an enthusiasm grows around the shares, and they tend to perform well. Wall Street analysts expect Amazon\u2019s earnings next year to be 66 percent higher than the forecast for 2013. They project a 10 percent uptick for Apple. But there is another conversation you need to have. It revolves around whether the market has already factored the hoped-for growth into the stock price. It is possible to pay too much for excellence. There are all sorts of ways to gauge how much credibility investors ascribe to a company\u2019s \u201cgrowth story.\u201d One is to look at what investors are paying now for a company\u2019s free cash flows, or the hard dollars it takes in from profits (minus the spending it does on plant and equipment). The results are stark. Apple\u2019s stock market value is nine times last year\u2019s free cash flows. On this metric, Amazon is at over 300 times. Sane investors would never touch a stock with such a dear valuation unless they felt cash flows were going to soar in the future. And this brings us to the part of investing that usually separates winners from losers: guessing whether companies will actually do what we expect them to. Amazon\u2019s believers don\u2019t mind that it\u2019s spending such huge amounts on setting up new operations for its retail and data businesses. At some point, hopefully in the not too distant future, that spending will fall as the expansion reaches its limits. In that case, Amazon will be churning out much bigger cash flows as it enjoys near unassailable dominance. Sure, but how wondrous will those cash flows be? Amazon\u2019s operations produced $4.2 billion of cash flows last year. Let\u2019s generously assume 10 percent annual growth for them, which would take them to $5.1 billion by the end of 2014. Let\u2019s be kind again and assume that capital expenditures fall a lot, to, say, $1 billion a year, from last year\u2019s $3.8 billion. Free cash flows in 2014 would therefore total $4.1 billion. Now, remember, at this future point, Amazon\u2019s growth in free cash flow will have slowed a lot. Investors will probably decide to attach a lower valuation to the company. Being generous, let\u2019s assume they value those hypothetical 2014 free cash flows at 21 times,  Google \u2019s multiple today. That would give Amazon a market worth of about $86 billion. That\u2019s 30 percent lower than today. Of course, the stock market believes what it wants to believe. It may well decide to remain starry-eyed about Amazon and give it a much higher valuation for years to come. But Apple\u2019s recent drubbing suggests even the strongest runs can end nastily.

        "name": "Amazon hybrid fills a literary void; Small in-house service showcases original work and allows authors a cut ",
        "content": " David Blum does not have a regular table at the Four Seasons or host celebrity parties at the top of the Standard Hotel. He does not get a lot of fawning press. After he was fired by The Village Voice and left The New York Press, Gawker Media in 2009 pronounced him \u2018\u2018a sad bumbling doctor for dying New York City weeklies.\u2019\u2019 But four years is an eon in the digital realm, and in that time Mr. Blum has transformed himself from doctor of the dying to midwife of the up-and-coming. As such, he is a man whom authors want to court. Mr. Blum is the editor of Amazon Kindle Singles, a Web service that is helping to promote a renaissance of novella-length journalism and fiction, known as e-shorts. Amazon Kindle Singles is a hybrid. First, it is a store within the megastore of Amazon.com, offering a showcase of carefully selected original works of 5,000 to 30,000 words that come from an array of outside publishers as well as from in-house. Most sell for less than $2, and Mr. Blum is the final arbiter of what goes up for sale. It is also a small, in-house publishing brand \u2014 analogous to a grocery store that makes an in-house brand of salsa to compete with other manufacturers. Mr. Blum comes up with his own ideas or cherry-picks pieces from the more than 1,000 unsolicited manuscripts he receives each month. He then edits them and helps pick cover art. Amazon Singles usually pays nothing upfront to the author (there are rare exceptions) and keeps 30 percent of all sales. Yet it is an enticing deal for some authors, because Singles now delivers a reliable purchasing audience, giving them a chance to earn thousands for their work. (A quick calculation shows that the authors make an average of roughly $22,000, but the amount varies widely by piece.) \u2018\u2018Every day I become more obsessed with how brilliant the concept is,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Blum, 57, said over coffee at the Lamb\u2019s Club in Manhattan, crediting the idea entirely to Amazon. For him, the brilliance is that authors can now share in the profits instead of getting a flat fee. \u2018\u2018The idea that writers would participate in the publishing model is just very bold,\u2019\u2019 he said. Amazon says the Singles store is profitable, having sold nearly five million copies since it opened in January 2011. But the program is as much about gaining entree into the literary world as it is about revenue. Amazon has become the b\u00eate noire of the industry, using its market share to keep the prices of books lower than publishers and authors would like. Its New York publishing branch, founded in 2012, has struggled partly because of that enmity, as brick-and-mortar bookstores have refused to carry its works. Amazon has also had to pay large sums to attract even second-tier authors. But because Singles is filling a literary terrain not crowded by other retailers, it has established itself with far less resistance than Amazon\u2019s other publishing branches did. With magazines folding or shrinking because of financial pressures, long-form storytelling has few places to flourish, and the company has leapt firmly into that void, along with other digital publishers like Atavist and Byliner and even some traditional houses like Penguin. Still, little that Amazon does fails to arouse suspicion. Authors are intrigued and covet the stream of money, but some are still afraid that they will alienate their book publishers by using Singles for novella-length work. Publishers are watching closely to see whether Amazon is building a next generation of talented authors who will have no connection to them \u2014 and in the process acquiring legitimacy in literary circles. Already, reliable best-selling authors like Stephen King have turned to the site for their own purposes. In January Mr. King published an 8,000-word essay on gun control as an Amazon Single. He opted for Singles because of its speed, he said. A week after he offered the script, it had been copy-edited, had cover art and was for sale online. Publishers point out that the best-selling Kindle Singles, like \u2018\u2018Second Son,\u2019\u2019 by the British thriller writer Lee Child, come through them and are also distributed across other Web sites that sell fiction of similar length, like Apple and Barnes & Noble. However, more than 250,000 copies of \u2018\u2018Second Son\u2019\u2019 were sold through Singles, by far the largest share of the market. For now, it falls to Mr. Blum to allay the suspicions, and he is using his deep connections in the New York media world to try to do so. It helps that he has worked for a range of publications, including The Wall Street Journal (where he met his wife, the television writer Terri Minsky, who created Disney\u2019s \u2018\u2018Lizzie McGuire\u2019\u2019), Esquire, New York magazine and The New York Times Magazine. He has taken part in a long-running poker game with the likes of Richard Ben Cramer, the author and journalist who died in January, and David Hirshey, now executive editor of HarperCollins. Mr. Hirshey recalled that Mr. Blum played so badly that they nicknamed him \u2018\u2018Deaf, Blum and Blind.\u2019\u2019 And his connections have helped in other ways. Breaking into journalism in the 1980s, Mr. Blum shared office space with Susan Orlean, now a New Yorker writer and the author of \u2018\u2018The Orchid Thief,\u2019\u2019 and Donald Katz, founder of Audible, which makes audiobooks. Mr. Katz, whose company was bought by Amazon in 2008, lobbied for Mr. Blum to get the job heading Singles. Ms. Orlean readily agreed to write an early single, \u2018\u2018Animalish\u2019\u2019 (2011), lending the brand prestige and credibility. Besides luring luminaries like Ms. Orlean,Mr. Blum has tried to maintain the brand\u2019s prestige by tightly limiting the number of offerings. Although the digital bookshelf is infinite, Kindle has posted only 345 Singles since its inception in January 2011, according to the company\u2019s figures. (As of March 20, the company says, about 28 percent of the works have sold more than 10,000 copies, and nearly 8 percent have sold over 50,000 copies.) Evan Ratliff, chief executive and co-founder of Atavist, said one thing his company likes about Singles is that it doesn\u2019t accept every submission. \u2018\u2018They actually make a concerted effort to find something great,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018While we might disagree on the specifics of what that is, our overall sensibilities are aligned.\u2019\u2019 But while remaining choosy, Mr. Blum takes a special pride in nurturing undiscovered authors. A favorite is Mishka Shubaly, a musician and recovered alcoholic who under Mr. Blum\u2019s tutelage has written three best-selling memoirs on Kindle Singles. Mr. Shubaly said that he admired Mr. Blum but that he could be a challenge to work for. \u2018\u2018He is a very frustrating editor because he will identify the problem, but won\u2019t give you a solution,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018He is like a therapist, and I mean that as the lowest possible insult.\u2019\u2019 Still, said Mr. Shubaly, who has been living off the income from his Singles, in the end \u2018\u2018it is something dramatically better than you could have done, and something that you feel is really your own.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "Amazon lets eBay take over tax fight; DealBook ",
        "content": " For more than a decade, Amazon led a ferocious lobbying campaign in Washington against legislation requiring online merchants to collect state and local sales tax from their customers. Local and national retailers with brick-and-mortar stores complained that online merchants were enjoying a tax-free ride \u2014 they don\u2019t have to collect state sales tax unless they have operations in the state \u2014 and getting an unfair advantage. The tax treatment was widely known as the Amazon loophole, until Amazon.com dropped its opposition to the tax. (More on why Amazon did that in a moment.) In Amazon\u2019s place has emerged its smaller rival, eBay, which has taken up the cause with a major campaign against the tax just as the issue is moving through Washington for the first time in earnest. On Monday, the bill cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate, setting it up for a vote this week, and President Barack Obama said he supported it. Over the weekend, John Donahoe, eBay\u2019s chief executive, sent out an audacious e-mail to tens of millions of eBay merchants, pleading with them to write their representatives in Congress and urge them to block the legislation. \u2018\u2018This legislation treats you and big multibillion-dollar online retailers \u2014 such as Amazon \u2014 exactly the same,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Donahoe wrote. \u2018\u2018It may harm your ability to grow and costs jobs, including yours.\u2019\u2019 Talk about being heavy-handed. Most of eBay\u2019s sellers have less than $1 million in out-of-state revenue and, under the terms of the proposal, the Marketplace Fairness Act, would be exempt from collecting the tax anyway. It isn\u2019t until the end of his letter that Mr. Donahoe argues for a compromise. If there is action, he wrote, the bill should be changed so that a small business is defined as making less than $10 million in out-of-state sales or having fewer than 50 employees. \u2018\u2018To put that in perspective, Amazon does more than $10 million of sales every 90 minutes.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Donahoe, who deserves credit for turning around eBay in recent years, isn\u2019t trying to protect the mom-and-pop store or the struggling artist. He\u2019s trying to keep substantial businesses with real revenue from paying taxes. When I asked an eBay spokeswoman to quantify how many eBay sellers would be affected by the legislation if it were not raised to the $10 million cap, she said she did not have a number. (Considering the amount of money and energy eBay is spending on its lobbying effort, you would think it would be able to quantify the cost.) Part of eBay\u2019s argument is that it is too complicated and expensive for small merchants to collect the tax. \u2018\u2018Are you prepared to collect sales taxes in the more than 9,600 tax jurisdictions across the U.S.?\u2019\u2019 Mr. Donahoe asked. What Mr. Donahoe did not mention is that Amazon will already collect those taxes for merchants if they ask, and eBay will help provide them with third-party technology services that will help them do so, too. There are a number of companies that will manage and streamline the process, like Avalara or TaxCloud. And you have to believe that if the bill gets passed, there will be a cottage industry of companies that will offer services to collect the taxes, including eBay, which has made a reputation trying to streamline the selling process for merchants. In fairness, eBay also argues that the cost of complying with enforcement will be a nightmare. Think about the prospect of an out-of-state tax audit. Before we continue, a little history: The reason the online merchants don\u2019t have to collect sales tax is a function of the Supreme Court ruling in 1992 in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota. In that case, Quill, a mail-order office equipment retailer, was sued over what North Dakota said was taxes due because Quill shipped products to the state. The court ruled that merchants did not have to collect taxes in a state unless they had a physical presence in the state. That covered mail-order businesses and, yes, the then-nascent business of Internet retailing. (Amazon didn\u2019t even exist then.) A note to readers, and to self: If you live in a state with a sales tax, you are supposed to submit uncollected taxes on Internet purchases at the end of the year, even if the merchant doesn\u2019t seek it at the time of the sale. Of course, nobody does that. At a time when states are desperate for revenue, you can see the allure of taxing online merchants. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, $23 billion is lost annually from out-of-state sales, a considerable portion from online transactions. There\u2019s an argument to made, which eBay does, that the sales tax is regressive for businesses \u2014 and it is. The tax does not discriminate between a large national retailer and a mom-and-pop. The tax is flat. And big business already has special tax advantages: States often offer big companies tax incentives to build stores and distribution systems, benefits that are not offered to small businesses. But on the flip side, there is an argument that the current state of sales taxes online is regressive for consumers. Poorer people are less likely to be able to benefit from being able to shop online. So what about Amazon? Why did it abandon the fight? Not because it felt altruistic. It was a business decision. As Amazon has grown, it has become better positioned to handle the tax hit. And perhaps more important, it is moving to build physical warehouse and shipping centers in many states so that it can offer faster delivery services, in some cases within 24 hours. That means it would most likely have had to collect sales tax anyway. In the end, it is unclear whether the Republican-controlled House of Representatives will approve tax legislation if it clears the Senate, as expected. But when consumers make purchases, either in a store or online, they should be prepared to pay the requisite sales tax. And, yes, merchants and lawmakers should provide the way to collect it.",

        "name": "Original Pilots, Judged by the Masses ",
        "content": " Amazon   delivered its  first bundle of original content   on Friday,  pilots   for eight comedies (and six children\u2019s shows) that could become series on  Amazon Instant Video . The digital twist is that not only can the public see these pilots, but it can also rate and review them, information Amazon says it will weigh in deciding which series are made. If there\u2019s an Amazon aesthetic at this point, it\u2019s frugality. With one or two exceptions, these are cheap productions. The cartoon  \u201cDark Minions\u201d   consists largely of animatics, the rudimentary precursor to finished animation. In most of the live-action pilots there appears to have been little or no budget for fine-tuning sound and color, and  \u201cOnion News Empire\u201d   looks like video that\u2019s been fading since the 1980s. This makes sense financially \u2014 Amazon doesn\u2019t need to impress any television network executives \u2014 and perhaps a generation raised on  YouTube  won\u2019t notice. While the shows\u2019 styles vary, their humor is resolutely middle-of-the-road, even in the few cases where there\u2019s language that wouldn\u2019t pass on broadcast TV or (in  \u201cBetas\u201d ) a flash of nudity. Any rough edges have been ground down. Whether Amazon wanted it that way, or whether the pilots\u2019 creators thought it would increase their chances, these are shows intended for maximum ease of digestion. In the spirit of Amazon\u2019s enterprise, I\u2019ve rated and reviewed each of the comedy pilots on a 1-to-5 scale and listed them in order of quality. For comparison I\u2019ve included the average Amazon user ratings as of Monday morning, when the number of votes ranged from just over 200 (for  \u201cSupanatural\u201d ) to more than 2,000 (for  \u201cZombieland\u201d ). Betas Critic, 3; Amazon users, 4.4 This Silicon Valley  comedy   by a pair of unknown writers, Evan Endicott and Josh Stoddard, stands out for the pungency of its humor (it was the only pilot that made me laugh out loud); the quality of the direction by Michael Lehmann (\u201cHeathers\u201d); and the distinctive performances by Charlie Saxton, Karan Soni, Jonathan C. Daly and Joe Dinicol as undistinguished techies trying to sell a social media app that\u2019s aptly described as a stalker\u2019s dream. Ed Begley Jr. is good as an angel investor, and Moby has a hilarious cameo. Supanatural Critic, 2; Amazon users, 4.3 An animated  show   about best friends who work at the mall and also guard the world against supernatural threats, \u201cSupanatural\u201d has as its reference points \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d and \u201cSupernatural,\u201d but it most closely resembles other wisecracking, pop-culture-saturated cartoons on FX and Adult Swim. The pilot, written by Price Peterson, Ryan Sandoval and Lily Sparks, parodies several Indiana Jones movies (while slipping in loving references to the R&B group TLC). When a deadly crystal skull tells the heroines that they both have muffin tops, the tart reply is: \u201cOh, no. This isn\u2019t just some doomsday device. This crystal skull is a hater!\u201d Alpha House Critic, 2; Amazon users, 4 The biggest disappointment among the pilots, given its provenance,  \u201cAlpha House\u201d   was written by Garry Trudeau, who did political satire much better 25 years ago in  \u201cTanner \u201988.\u201d   It\u2019s smooth, nicely shot, well acted (by John Goodman and Clark Johnson, among others) and dull. The jokes are tired, even when the references are to nearly current events, and the whole project, down to its perky sitcom theme music, feels anachronistic. The house of the title is shared by four moderate Republican senators in Washington: a closeted gay man, an African-American dealmaker facing indictment, a cynical good old boy and a womanizing Latino. Bill Murray and Stephen Colbert make brief appearances; Mr. Colbert\u2019s is funny. Zombieland Critic, 2; Amazon users, 3.8 Sort of a prequel to, and sort of a recapitulation of, the 2009  film   of the same title, this  comic-horror show   presents the same group of four survivors trying to travel across the country. This time they\u2019re helped by instructions from the disembodied voice of an OnStar navigation system. That doesn\u2019t make up, though, for the loss of Woody Harrelson and the other superior actors who made the movie a surprise hit. Dark Minions Critic, 2; Amazon users, 3.7 Kevin Sussman, who plays the sad-sack comics-store owner on  \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d   is one of the writers of this  animated show , which crosses science-fiction adventure with workplace comedy. A vast conglomerate has taken over the universe, and two slackers with menial jobs aboard its space battleship accidentally make contact with rebel forces, which of course include a good-looking female commander. It\u2019s like a comics-shop bull session turned into a script, with some good jokes \u2014 the names kicked around for a new megaweapon include World Whacker and Planet B Gone \u2014 and funny voice performances by Mr. Sussman and Richard Kind. Onion News Empire Critic, 2; Amazon users, 4.3 Positing that the Onion News Network has become a News Corporation-like behemoth (with a Rupert Murdoch-like patriarch) that dominates the world\u2019s media,  this   is satire at its broadest: National Lampoon with elements of \u201cArrested Development\u201d and \u201c30 Rock.\u201d Jeffrey Tambor, a meta-TV veteran (\u201cThe Larry Sanders Show\u201d), stars as the Machiavellian chief anchor. The funniest bits are straight out of The Onion as it currently exists: mock headlines, read between scenes, like, \u201cThe nation\u2019s poor have pooled their money and started an oil company in hopes of finally receiving support from the government.\u201d Those Who Can\u2019t Critic, 1; Amazon users, 4.4 A strained  farce   about three incompetent and unpleasant teachers who plot to bring down the even more unpleasant student who loves to taunt them. Browsers Critic, 1; Amazon users, 3.4 Four interns start work at a Huffington Post-like Web site and occasionally burst into song in this musical confection, which makes \u201cGlee\u201d look like \u201cThe Threepenny Opera.\u201d The ditties, by Brendan Milburn and David Javerbaum (who also wrote the script), have lines like \u201cGoing viral! Going viral! Putting worms inside your brain\u201d and \u201cCause when I tweet/I am free/Free to let these fingers fight the powers that be,\u201d and they sound like copies of copies of Jonathan Larson (\u201cRent\u201d). The exception is a number with an unpublishable title that gives Bebe Neuwirth, as a preening, Euro-accented media mogul, a chance to show off her song-and-dance chops. Amazon has been understandably vague about how strongly viewers\u2019 ratings will factor into its decisions, and you have to wonder what the real attitude is, inside the company and especially among the pilots\u2019 creators and producers, toward giving the public a say after so much work has been done. It will also be a new experience, should any of the pilots be turned down, to see work rejected in such a public fashion. (Of course, Amazon doesn\u2019t have to turn down any of the pilots \u2014 unlike a TV network, it doesn\u2019t have a limited number of slots to fill.) The move into original video puts Amazon in the unusual position of selling its own content (as opposed to hardware like the Kindle). It\u2019s one thing to let the market determine whether you carry someone else\u2019s books or DVDs; it might be more difficult to give the buyer control over your own creations.",

        "content": " David Blum does not have a regular table at the Four Seasons or host celebrity parties at the top of the Standard Hotel. He does not get a lot of fawning press. After he was fired by The Village Voice and left The New York Press, Gawker Media in 2009  pronounced him   \u201ca sad bumbling doctor for dying New York City weeklies.\u201d But four years is an eon in the digital realm, and in that time Mr. Blum has transformed himself from doctor of the dying to midwife of the up-and-coming. As such, he is a man whom authors want to court. Mr. Blum is the editor of Amazon Kindle Singles, a Web service that is helping to promote a renaissance of novella-length journalism and fiction, known as e-shorts. Amazon Kindle Singles is a hybrid. First, it is a store within the megastore of Amazon.com, offering a showcase of carefully selected original works of 5,000 to 30,000 words that come from an array of outside publishers as well as from in-house. Most sell for less than $2, and Mr. Blum is the final arbiter of what goes up for sale. It is also a small, in-house publishing brand \u2014 analogous to a grocery store that makes an in-house brand of salsa to compete with other manufacturers. Mr. Blum comes up with his own ideas or cherry-picks pieces from the more than 1,000 unsolicited manuscripts he receives each month. He then edits them and helps pick cover art. Amazon Singles usually pays nothing upfront to the author (there are rare exceptions) and keeps 30 percent of all sales. Yet it is an enticing deal for some authors, because Singles now delivers a reliable purchasing audience, giving them a chance to earn thousands for their work. (A quick calculation shows that the authors make an average of roughly $22,000, but the amount varies widely by piece.) \u201cEvery day I become more obsessed with how brilliant the concept is,\u201d Mr. Blum, 57, said over coffee at the Lamb\u2019s Club in Manhattan, crediting the idea entirely to Amazon. For him, the brilliance is that authors can now share in the profits instead of getting a flat fee. \u201cThe idea that writers would participate in the publishing model is just very bold,\u201d he said. Amazon says the Singles store is profitable, having sold nearly five million copies since it opened in January 2011. But the program is as much about gaining entree into the literary world as it is about revenue. Amazon has become the b\u00eate noire of the industry, using its market share to keep the prices of books lower than publishers and authors would like. Its New York publishing branch, founded in 2012, has struggled partly because of that enmity, as brick-and-mortar bookstores have refused to carry its works. Amazon has also had to pay large sums to attract even second-tier authors. But because Singles is filling a literary terrain not crowded by other retailers, it has established itself with far less resistance than Amazon\u2019s other publishing branches did. With magazines folding or shrinking because of financial pressures, long-form storytelling has few places to flourish, and the company has leapt firmly into that void, along with other digital publishers like Atavist and Byliner and even some traditional houses like Penguin. Still, little that Amazon does fails to arouse suspicion. Authors are intrigued and covet the stream of money, but some are still afraid that they will alienate their book publishers by using Singles for novella-length work. Publishers are watching closely to see whether Amazon is building a next generation of talented authors who will have no connection to them \u2014 and in the process acquiring legitimacy in literary circles. Already, reliable best-selling authors like Stephen King have turned to the site for their own purposes. In January Mr. King published an 8,000-word essay on gun control as an Amazon Single. He opted for Singles because of its speed, he said. A week after he offered the script, it had been copy-edited, had cover art and was for sale online. Publishers point out that the best-selling Kindle Singles, like \u201cSecond Son,\u201d by the British thriller writer Lee Child, come through them and are also distributed across other Web sites that sell fiction of similar length, like Apple and Barnes & Noble. However, more than 250,000 copies of \u201cSecond Son\u201d were sold through Singles, by far the largest share of the market. For now, it falls to Mr. Blum to allay the suspicions, and he is using his deep connections in the New York media world to try to do so. It helps that he has worked for a range of publications, including The Wall Street Journal (where he met his wife, the television writer Terri Minsky, who created Disney\u2019s \u201cLizzie McGuire\u201d), Esquire, New York magazine and The New York Times Magazine. He has taken part in a long-running poker game with the likes of Richard Ben Cramer, the author and journalist who died in January, and David Hirshey, now executive editor of HarperCollins. Mr. Hirshey recalled that Mr. Blum played so badly that they nicknamed him \u201cDeaf, Blum and Blind.\u201d And his connections have helped in other ways. Breaking into journalism in the 1980s, Mr. Blum shared office space with Susan Orlean, now a New Yorker writer and the author of \u201cThe Orchid Thief,\u201d and Donald Katz, founder of Audible, which makes audiobooks. Mr. Katz, whose company was bought by Amazon in 2008, lobbied for Mr. Blum to get the job heading Singles. Ms. Orlean readily agreed to write an early single, \u201cAnimalish\u201d (2011), lending the brand prestige and credibility. Besides luring luminaries like Ms. Orlean, Mr. Blum has tried to maintain the brand\u2019s prestige by tightly limiting the number of offerings. Although the digital bookshelf is infinite, Kindle has posted only 345 Singles since its inception in January 2011, according to the company\u2019s figures. (As of March 20, the company says, about 28 percent of the works have sold more than 10,000 copies, and nearly 8 percent have sold over 50,000 copies.) Evan Ratliff, chief executive and co-founder of Atavist, said one thing his company likes about Singles is that it doesn\u2019t accept every submission. \u201cThey actually make a concerted effort to find something great,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile we might disagree on the specifics of what that is, our overall sensibilities are aligned.\u201d But while remaining choosy, Mr. Blum takes a special pride in nurturing undiscovered authors. A favorite is Mishka Shubaly, a musician and recovered alcoholic who under Mr. Blum\u2019s tutelage has written three best-selling memoirs on Kindle Singles. Mr. Shubaly said he admired Mr. Blum but that he could be a challenge to work for. \u201cHe is a very frustrating editor because he will identify the problem, but won\u2019t give you a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is like a therapist, and I mean that as the lowest possible insult.\u201d Still, said Mr. Shubaly, who has been living off the income from his Singles, in the end \u201cit is something dramatically better than you could have done, and something that you feel is really your own.\u201d",

Now, eBay has taken up the cause as the issue is moving through Washington in earnest for the first time,  Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column . A bill introducing such a tax cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate, setting it up for a vote this week. John Donahoe, eBay\u2019s chief executive, made his thoughts known over the weekend in an e-mail to tens of millions of eBay merchants. \u201cThis legislation treats you and big multibillion-dollar online retailers \u2014 such as Amazon \u2014 exactly the same,\u201d wrote Mr. Donahoe. \u201cIt may harm your ability to grow and costs jobs, including yours.\u201d Mr. Sorkin writes: \u201cMr. Donahoe, who deserves credit for turning around eBay in recent years, isn\u2019t trying to protect the mom-and-pop store or the struggling artist, he\u2019s trying to keep substantial businesses with real revenue from paying taxes.\u201d \u201cIn the end, it is unclear whether the Republican-controlled House will approve tax legislation if it clears the Senate, as expected.

Ceresney, a former federal prosecutor turned defense lawyer who on Monday was named a co-director of the enforcement unit of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is confronting a fresh batch of challenges. \u201cMr. Ceresney will inherit a unit that is on pace to file the lowest number of enforcement cases in a decade, according to S.E.C. figures provided to The New York Times,\u201d  DealBook\u2019s Ben Protess writes . \u201cIn the last six months, through March 31, the number of cases is down 23 percent from the same period a year ago \u2014 a sharp contrast from recent years when the agency trumpeted its record-high numbers.\u201d \u201cSome longtime S.E.C. officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, also question whether their focus on insider trading cases distracts from investigations of broader significance. What\u2019s more, the officials say that the S.E.C. opened fewer investigations in the 2012 fiscal year than the previous year, presenting a potential obstacle to Mr. Ceresney, who will take the reins with George Canellos, an agency veteran.\u201d AWAITING A BLUEPRINT ON FED LENDING | \u201cAfter the Federal Reserve lent more than $1 trillion to big banks during the 2008 financial crisis, Congress required the central bank to devise specific ways of protecting taxpayers when doling out emergency loans to financial institutions,\u201d  DealBook\u2019s Peter Eavis writes . \u201cBut nearly three years after that overhaul became law, the Fed still has not established these regulations. The delay involves a crucial but little-noticed part of the Dodd-Frank act, the sweeping financial sector overhaul that Congress passed in July 2010. One part of the legislation focused on the Fed. While the government used many different tools to shore up the financial system during the crisis, Congress was well aware that the Fed played a decisive role.\u201d ON THE AGENDA | Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, are to  speak at the National Press Club   in Washington about their plan to address too-big-to-fail institutions.

On Monday, Netflix said its revenue in the first quarter topped $1 billion for the first time, largely because it quickly added subscribers to its streaming service, gaining about two million in the United States during the quarter. The company\u2019s stock soared in trading after hours, passing $200 a share for the first time since 2011. \u201cAfter the subscriber data was released, analysts rushed to note that Netflix, with 29.2 million such subscribers, had apparently surpassed HBO.

        "name": "Microsoft takes aim at Amazon\u2019s cloud service; Software giant to match prices in push to increase its 30% market share ",
        "content": " As president of Microsoft\u2019s server and tools division, a $19 billion-a-year business devoted to databases, servers and other software products, Satya Nadella has a predictable cast of competitors to worry about. There is Oracle, VMware, SAP and a bunch of other makers of highly technical products that make everyday services like banking and airline reservations work, even if the software running them is invisible to most consumers. But one of Mr. Nadella\u2019s competitors \u2014 Amazon.com, the Internet retailer \u2014 is not like the others. Amazon is beloved by consumers for its seemingly infinite online selection of merchandise available for one-click purchasing, speedy delivery and Kindle e-readers. Out of view of most of the public, though, it has transformed itself into a huge player in the field of cloud computing. By renting capacity on the industrial-strength servers and beefy Internet connections in its data centers to anyone willing to pay for it, Amazon has become the virtual landlord of choice for technology start-ups, including the likes of Instagram and Foursquare. Microsoft wants a piece of the action. On Tuesday, the company is opening to general availability a new service that competes directly with Amazon\u2019s cloud offering. (Microsoft has been testing the service with customers for the past year.) And to make sure it is taken seriously, Microsoft is committing to match Amazon\u2019s prices for its cloud service, which is known as the Elastic Compute Cloud. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a two-horse race between us and Amazon,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Nadella said in a phone interview last week, noting the Seattle location of its cloud rival, a short distance away from Microsoft\u2019s Redmond, Washington, headquarters. Actually, that may be wishful thinking on Mr. Nadella\u2019s part. Google and Rackspace are among the other companies that are fighting with Microsoft for the No. 2 spot in the cloud market. The cloud is a profound threat to Microsoft\u2019s traditional business of selling software that people install on their machines. As a result, the company\u2019s executives for some time now have been blaring their own plans to become serious cloud competitors. For its first foray into the business a few years ago with a service called Windows Azure, Microsoft settled on an approach that played to its strengths, offering customers the ability to rent applications like databases and servers for broadcasting video. Amazon, in contrast, was known for more minimalist, low-level services \u2014 storage space on its servers, computing time and a share of its Internet connections. If Microsoft\u2019s offering was akin to a garage space outfitted with an arsenal of power tools, Amazon was renting just the garage. Microsoft\u2019s approach had appeal \u2014 the company says it has 200,000 Windows Azure customers \u2014 but not as much as what Amazon is offering. While the big companies targeted by Microsoft for its initial Windows Azure services are likely to embrace the cloud aggressively at some point, the most ardent cloud supporters right now are technically sophisticated start-ups. And what they want is what Amazon \u2014 and starting this week, perhaps Microsoft \u2014 has to offer. \u2018\u2018They mistimed the market for sure,\u2019\u2019 James Staten, an analyst at Forrester Research, said of Microsoft. In Forrester\u2019s surveys of cloud developers, about 70 percent say they are using Amazon\u2019s infrastructure, while about 30 percent say they are using Microsoft. (Many customers spread their business across several cloud vendors.) Mr. Nadella, a Microsoft veteran, said the company was well positioned to become a stronger player in cloud computing because it had a more diverse portfolio of offerings than Amazon. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s still the early part of the cloud market,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Clearly they have done a good job in one segment of it. But it will play out.\u2019\u2019",

        "name": "Amazon Gains On iTunes In Music Sales ",
        "content": " Amazon is helping Apple celebrate the 10th anniversary of iTunes by gaining momentum on music downloads in the United States. According to a new study released by NPD Group, the market research firm, in 2012 Amazon accounted for 22 percent of paid music downloaded in the United States. This is up from 15 percent in 2011. The report, ''Annual Music Study 2012,'' found that Apple still dominates the music download world, with 63 percent of all paid downloads taking place through iTunes. Amazon's rise seems to be attributed to updates of the company's color Kindle Fire tablets last year. These tablets are capable of playing music directly purchased from AmazonMP3, the online retailer's digital music service. The Kindle Fire provides access to more than 18 million movies, TV shows, magazines and books, according to Amazon. Although Amazon does not share numbers about sales of its Kindle Fire devices, calculations by Forrester Research estimate that Amazon sold close to five million Kindle Fire tablets by the end of last year. In comparison, Apple has sold more than 100 million iPads. Although there has been huge growth in customers using streaming music services, including Pandora, Rdio and Spotify, NPD Group reported that the number of music downloads in the United States has remained relatively unaffected by these new music outlets. ''NPD estimates that average per-buyer spending on music downloads increased 6 percent, year over year, due largely to increases in music purchasing by teens, along with an increase in the number of consumers purchasing both single song tracks and full albums,'' the company said. The report said 44 million Americans purchased at least one song or album last year. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

        "name": "Amazon Introduces New Children\u2019s Programs ",
        "content": " Parents with strong opinions about the television available for your preschoolers, Amazon is looking for you. Its Amazon Studios has  six pilots available   for free streaming, all targeted at younger children (and their downloading parents). Creators range from Angela Santomero and Traci Paige Johnson (from \u201cBlue\u2019s Clues\u201d) to the Jim Henson Company. Each program works to blend education with entertainment in what\u2019s fast becoming the industry-standard style.  \u201cSara Solves It\u201d   presents math mysteries in a city full of numbers and geometric designs. (Ms. Santomero,  a   Motherlode contributor,   tells me it\u2019s \u201cbig math for little kids.\u201d)  \u201cAnnebots\u201d   offers a young scientist working in a junkyard,  \u201cCreative Galaxy\u201d   is an \u201canimated interactive art adventure,\u201d and the puppets of  \u201cTeeny Tiny Dogs\u201d   demonstrate subtle lessons in \u201chappiness\u201d based on the latest research. \u201cBut you don\u2019t necessarily have to focus on the educational part,\u201d said Roy Price, the director of Amazon Studios. \u201cThese are terrific, entertaining shows, they\u2019re fun and simple \u2014 that\u2019s the trick of it, to combine a great show and a great message in a way that\u2019s informed by some of the leading thinkers in the field of children\u2019s television.\u201d Did Amazon Studios succeed? You, and your children, can decide and in the process tell Amazon which of the pilots should become series. You can also catch a glimpse of what goes into the development of the shows, some of which (like \u201cCreative Galaxy\u201d) aren\u2019t yet fully produced or animated. \u201cWe\u2019re letting people in before we\u2019re done,\u201d Ms. Santomero said. \u201cI\u2019m excited and I\u2019m nervous, and it\u2019s kind of scary, as a creator, to put it out there when it\u2019s not done and all your ideas are not fully there, but it\u2019s kind of amazing, too.\u201d The pilots can only be streamed or downloaded \u2014 they\u2019re not available on network or cable TV. Amazon Studios is clearly aimed at families who take their video \u201cto go\u201d on smaller devices (although some families also stream to televisions). It\u2019s a change that shifts the selection of new programs to parents (preschoolers won\u2019t see any promotions for these shows while watching an old favorite, at least not yet). It\u2019s also a change that suggests that preschoolers might be viewing their programs on smaller screens \u2014 screens that might not be visible to their parents. Most of the television viewing in our family takes place on the television in our living room, enabling me to help my oldest spot \u201cclues\u201d with Blue 10 years ago and offering me the opportunity, now, to comment on their chosen weekend viewing (\u201cI have never, in all of my life, met anyone as stupid as those characters\u201d). So I might stream, or later download, an Amazon program. But while  more people watch television programs on   computers and devices now , our family ( and many others ) hasn\u2019t really made that shift. I\u2019d miss the interactivity of shared watching (even if I\u2019m not really paying attention) with programs that were device-centric, and although we\u2019re capable of streaming to the television, it\u2019s still rare in our house. How much of your children\u2019s television viewing comes from streaming or downloads, and are you interested in what Amazon has to offer (available free now, but probably only through an Amazon Prime subscription later)?

        "name": "Bezos\u2019s Shout-Out for His Cloud Service ",
        "content": " That day Amazon  published   its annual report. In the accompanying letter to shareholders, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive spends a great deal of space defending Amazon\u2019s efforts to keep lowering prices and adding features to its products. This will, he says, win customer loyalty and repay the company over the long haul. Not surprising stuff, for a company that has risen to dominance by all but ignoring profitability for the sake of scale. What is surprising is the amount of ink (or more properly, pixels, given that this was primarily an e-document) that Mr. Bezos gave Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s cloud computing rental service. AWS is the world\u2019s largest public cloud, as the rental of computing, data storage and associated applications is called. Within Amazon itself, however, it is small, accounting for most of the $2.5 billion in \u201cother\u201d revenue Amazon made in 2012. Total revenue for the year was $61 billion. By next year AWS, which is growing fast, may well account for more than 5 percent of company revenue, at which time it should break into its own category. In the letter, Mr. Bezos singles out the service as \u201ca very clear example\u201d of giving the customer more than expected: \u201cIn 2012, AWS announced 159 new features and services,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe\u2019ve reduced AWS prices 27 times since launching 7 years ago, added enterprise service support enhancements, and created innovative tools to help customers be more efficient. AWS Trusted Advisor monitors customer configurations, compares them to known best practices, and then notifies customers where opportunities exist to improve performance, enhance security, or save money. Yes, we are actively telling customers they\u2019re paying us more than they need to. In the last 90 days, customers have saved millions of dollars through Trusted Advisor, and the service is only getting started. All of this progress comes in the context of AWS being the widely recognized leader in its area \u2014 a situation where you might worry that external motivation could fail. On the other hand, internal motivation \u2014 the drive to get the customer to say \u201cWow\u201d \u2014 keeps the pace of innovation fast.\u201d It is an unusual shout-out at a time when most Amazon investors don\u2019t know, or care, much about AWS. Remember, though, that Mr. Bezos is all about the long game. Over time, top executives at AWS say, they fully expect AWS to be as big a contributor to the business as Amazon\u2019s third-party sales. It is not too early to get ready for that day, particularly with both  Google   and  Microsoft   increasing their own efforts in the cloud.

        "name": "One on One: Jason Merkoski and the View of E-Books From the Inside ",
        "content": " Technology companies will occasionally acknowledge they were wrong \u2014 just last week Apple had to apologize to its Chinese customers \u2014 but you hardly ever hear them express doubt about the glorious future they are building for us all. So it is refreshing to see Jason Merkoski, a leader of the team that built Amazon\u2019s first Kindle, dispense with the usual techo-utopianism and say, \u201cI think we\u2019ve made a proverbial pact with the devil in digitizing our words.\u201d And this: \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to overlook the fact that Big Brother won\u2019t be a politician but an ad man and that he\u2019ll have the face of Google.\u201d Mr. Merkoski even has mixed feelings about Amazon, which he left two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to love Amazon,\u201d he notes. \u201cNot the way we love Apple or a bookstore.\u201d Those comments are from  \u201cBurning the Page: The Ebook Revolution and the Future of Reading,\u201d   which Sourcebooks will publish Tuesday as, of course, an e-book. A physical edition will follow this summer. It\u2019s a mixture of an insider\u2019s tale, quirky analysis and informed speculation about our onrushing digital destiny, told with an appealing ambivalence that should give it a wide readership. What follows is an edited Q&A with the 41-year-old author. Q. You write that \u201cAmazon, Apple and Google are a bit like medieval fortresses in their own ways. They\u2019re secretive like China or Japan before they opened up to Westerners, or like Tibet or Mecca, closed to foreigners.\u201d Are they afraid that if people knew what was going on, the peasants might storm the gates? A. There are two issues about secrecy here: social responsibility and intellectual property. As far as social responsibility goes, let me just say this: These companies have entire buildings filled with lawyers. They aren\u2019t there to come up with new lawyer jokes. They are there, in part, to keep people like me from even answering this question. That said, I think if people were given a chance to spend a day looking inside Amazon or Apple\u2019s veil of secrecy, most of them would be fascinated \u2014 although some might boycott. Q. And with intellectual property? A. The biggest tech companies are secretive to the point of clinical paranoia because there\u2019s an all-out arms race in innovation. If one company knew what another was doing, it could one-up the other with newer, better, cheaper features. That said, tech companies cross-pollinate all the time, with their ideas and worker-bees who flit from hive to hive, from Apple to Amazon to Google. Q. You also say, in discussing the tech companies\u2019 power: \u201cWhat moral or literary sensibilities do the executives at Amazon have? What about the retailers at Barnes & Noble or Google or Apple? You have to ask yourself whether you trust these men.\u201d Well, do you? A. There are three dimensions of trust here. Do I trust retailers not to censor books, do I trust them with my personal data, and do I trust them to curate great books for me to read? Frankly, I don\u2019t trust the executives at any e-book retailer when it comes to censorship. I know many of them. If push came to shove, I think most of these execs would rather pull e-books from the store, effectively censoring them, if that would avoid bad press. These are major retailers, not your quirky corner bookstores. They\u2019re manned by former management consultants in clean shirts and pressed Dockers, not eccentric book-lovers with beards and cats. Q. And your personal data? A. I do trust them with my identity. These companies are obsessed with safeguarding privacy. The worst they\u2019re going to do is show me more ads. Q. And to recommend things? A. Not yet. When it comes to book recommendations, retailers have the literary sensibilities of a spreadsheet \u2014 they\u2019ll just recommend the most popular books to me, or books that other people also bought, but they know nothing of the soul and sparkle of a great book. I hope this changes over time. Q. For an e-book developer you certainly seem attached to your physical books. Even after trying to cull them, you still have thousands of them. A. I\u2019m a sentimentalist. I\u2019ve got many more books than friends, and I think I always will. Some are such a part of my life that I can\u2019t get rid of them. Q. In some ways, \u201cBurning the Page\u201d is a celebration of the physical book even as it is looking ahead to its extinction. A. Reading is great, but I don\u2019t know whether you need paper and ink for it. You\u2019re going to get so much more from e-books because they bring your friends and family into the margins of your reading experience. They will be literally on the same page with you. Q. That gives me the creeps. A. We can lament the older experience of reading, because that\u2019s what we were raised with. But there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. Technology has a way of shifting, and we\u2019re adaptable. That\u2019s our genius: we do adapt. Q. Physical books were convenient, cheap, easy to use, attractive, practically indestructible. What will the great advantages of e-books be? A. In 20 years, the space of one generation, print books will be as rare as vinyl LPs. You\u2019ll still be able to find them in artsy hipster stores, but that\u2019s about it. So the great advantage of e-books is also their curse; e-books will be the only game in town if you want to read a book. It\u2019s sobering, and a bit sad. That said, e-books can do what print books can\u2019t. They\u2019ll allow you to fit an entire library into the space of one book. They\u2019ll allow you to search for anything in an instant, save your thoughts forever, share them with the world, and connect with other readers right there, inside the book. The book of the future will live and breathe. Q. You also write about what will be lost. A. I found a book at my grandmother\u2019s house that was inscribed by my great-grandfather. I learned what his original last name was \u2014 before he changed it. That was an interesting link to my past. We\u2019re going to lose that sort of trace of ourselves if we go all digital. Q. Another surprising thing you said was, \u201cE-books aren\u2019t ready for children yet.\u201d A. Giving children an e-book at this point might not be that much better than plunking them down in front of a TV, especially if they\u2019re reading the e-book on a multifunction device with instant messages, games and other distractions. Better they should be outside and engaged with the world. Q. Why did you leave Amazon? A. Working at Amazon was like getting an M.B.A. and a Ph.D. at the same time. It was an incredible education. These were the smartest people I ever worked with. But Amazon had a dark side as well, as if it were the mean stepmother in a fairy tale. There was this push to get great products out to consumers. It makes a lot of teams very haggard. Amazon is held together by adrenaline, spreadsheets and people running around like crazy.

        "content": " Say you need a latt\u00e9. You might pull out your phone, open the Yelp app and search for a nearby cafe. If instead you want to buy an espresso machine, you will most likely tap Amazon.com. Either way, Google lost a customer. Google remains the undisputed king of search, with about two-thirds of the U.S. market. But the nature of search is changing, especially as more people search for what they want to buy, eat or learn on their mobile devices. This has put the $22 billion search industry, perhaps the most lucrative and influential of online businesses, at its most significant crossroad since its invention. No longer do people want to search the Web like the index of a book \u2014 finding links where a particular keyword appears. They expect new kinds of customized search, which develop the knowledge and comprehension to answer specific queries, not just point people in the right direction. As a result, topical sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor or Amazon are chipping away at Google\u2019s hold. \u2018\u2018What people want is, \u2018You ask a very simple question and you get a very simple answer,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Oren Etzioni, a professor at the University of Washington who has co-founded companies for shopping and flight search. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t want the 10 blue links on that small screen. We want to know the closest sushi place, make a reservation and be on our way.\u2019\u2019 People are overwhelmed at how crowded the Internet has become \u2014 Google says there are 30 trillion Web addresses, up from one trillion five years ago \u2014 and people expect their computers and phones to be smarter and do more for them. Many of the new efforts are services that people do not even think of as search engines. Amazon, for example, has a larger share than Google of U.S. shopping searches, the most lucrative kind because people are in the mood to buy something. On sites like Pinterest and Polyvore, people have curated their favorite things from around the Web to produce results when you search for, say, \u2018\u2018lace dress.\u2019\u2019 On smartphones, people skip Google and go directly to apps, like Kayak or Weather Underground. Other apps send people information, like traffic or flight delays, before they even ask for it. People use YouTube to search for things like how to tie a bow tie, Siri to search on their iPhones, online maps to find local places and Facebook to find things their friends have liked. And services like LinkedIn Influencers and Quora are trying to be different kinds of search engines \u2014 places to find high-quality, expert content and avoid weeding through everything else on the Web. On Quora, questions like \u2018\u2018What was it like to work for Steve Jobs?\u2019\u2019 get answered by people with firsthand knowledge, something Google cannot provide. Google remains the one to beat, even as alternative search sites become popular. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re the specialty store you\u2019re going into here and there,\u2019\u2019 said Danny Sullivan, an editor of Search Engine Land, a blog, \u2018\u2018but they\u2019re not your grocery store.\u2019\u2019 Yet the promise of search is big enough that even though Microsoft loses billions of dollars a year on Bing and has failed to make a major dent in Google\u2019s U.S. market share, it keeps at it. Microsoft \u2014 which in February had 17 percent of that market, rising to 26 percent when the searches it powered for Yahoo are included \u2014 has said it views search as essential to its other products, whether the Xbox or phones. \u2018\u2018You have millions of people a day saying exactly what they want, and if you\u2019re an advertiser, it\u2019s a beautiful vehicle,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Sullivan said. EMarketer estimates that Google earns about three-quarters of search ad spending in the United States. Search engines bring companies troves of data and a measure of control as Internet users\u2019 entry point to the digital world. There are signs that people\u2019s search behaviors are changing, however, with consequences for these companies. Searches on traditional services, dominated by Google, declined 3 percent in the second half of last year after having risen for years, according to comScore, and the number of searches per searcher declined 7 percent. In contrast, searches on topical sites, known as vertical search engines, climbed 8 percent. While traditional searches increased again this year, other data reflect the threat to Google. In the first quarter, spending on search ads fell 1 percent, a significant slowdown for Google, according to IgnitionOne, a digital marketing company. Last year, Google lost U.S. market share in search ads for the first time, according to eMarketer, falling to 72.8 percent from 74 percent. This year, ad spending on traditional search engines is expected to grow more slowly than overall online ad spending, a reversal. Its growth significantly outpaced that of online ad spending until last year, eMarketer said. Google is not watching from the sidelines. It is making more changes to search offerings, at a faster pace than it has in years. Larry Page, its co-founder and chief executive, renamed the search division \u2018\u2018knowledge.\u2019\u2019 Google\u2019s mission, organizing the world\u2019s information, was too narrow. Now he wanted people to learn from Google. Google now shows answers instead of just links if you search something like \u2018\u2018March Madness,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018weather\u2019\u2019 or even \u2018\u2018my flight,\u2019\u2019 in which case it can pull flight information from people\u2019s Gmail accounts. The company\u2019s biggest step happened last year, when it introduced the knowledge graph. While search generally matches keywords to Web sites, the knowledge graph uses semantic search, which understands the meanings of and connections among people, places and things. A typical search engine, for instance, responds to a search for \u2018\u2018Diana\u2019\u2019 by showing Web pages on which that word appears, whether Wikipedia entries on the classical goddess of the hunt or the late princess of Wales or an engagement ring company. But a more knowledgeable, humanlike search engine could know that you were looking for the online profile of your roommate, Diana, or that you were also interested in Kate Middleton. \u2018\u2018What Google is beginning to do is share some of the knowledge in the world that humans have in their minds,\u2019\u2019 said Ben Gomes, a Google fellow, \u2018\u2018so users can begin to communicate with Google in a way that\u2019s much more natural to their thinking.\u2019\u2019 Google says these small steps show where it is headed. In the future, Google could answer more complicated questions, Mr. Gomes said, like \u2018\u2018How far is it from here to the Eiffel Tower?\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Where could I go to a concert in warm weather next year?\u2019\u2019 Despite the advances of alternative search services, online habits are just as hard to break as real-world ones, especially when they are useful, said Andrew Lipsman, vice president for industry analysis at comScore. \u2018\u2018Most people have this very strong Google habit,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I go there every day and it gives me information I want, so it\u2019s a self-reinforcing cycle. Not anyone can come in and just do those things.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " Say you need a latt\u00e9. You might pull out your phone, open the Yelp app and search for a nearby cafe. If instead you want to buy an espresso machine, you will most likely tap  Amazon.com . Either way,  Google   lost a customer. Google remains the undisputed king of search, with about two-thirds of the market. But the nature of search is changing, especially as more people search for what they want to buy, eat or learn on their mobile devices. This has put the $22 billion search industry, perhaps the most lucrative and influential of online businesses, at its most significant crossroad since its invention. No longer do consumers want to search the Web like the index of a book \u2014 finding links at which a particular keyword appears. They expect new kinds of customized search, like that on topical sites such as Yelp, TripAdvisor or Amazon, which are chipping away at Google\u2019s hold. Google and its competitors are trying to develop the knowledge and comprehension to answer specific queries, not just point users in the right direction. \u201cWhat people want is, \u2018You ask a very simple question and you get a very simple answer,\u2019 \u201d said Oren Etzioni, a professor at the University of Washington who has co-founded companies for shopping and flight search. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the 10 blue links on that small screen. We want to know the closest sushi place, make a reservation and be on our way.\u201d People are overwhelmed at how crowded the Internet has become \u2014 Google says there are 30 trillion Web addresses, up from 1 trillion five years ago \u2014 and users expect their computers and phones to be smarter and do more for them. Many of the new efforts are services that people do not even think of as search engines. Amazon, for example, has  a larger share than Google   of shopping searches, the most lucrative kind because people are in the mood to buy something. On sites like Pinterest and Polyvore, users have curated their favorite things from around the Web to produce results when you search for, say, \u201clace dress.\u201d On smartphones, people skip Google and  go directly to apps , like Kayak or Weather Underground. Other apps send people information, like traffic or flight delays, before they even ask for it. People use YouTube to search for things like how to tie a bow tie, Siri to search on their iPhones, online maps to find local places and Facebook to find things their friends have liked. And services like LinkedIn Influencers and Quora are trying to be different kinds of search engines \u2014 places to find high-quality, expert content and avoid weeding through everything else on the Web. On Quora, questions like \u201cWhat was it like to work for Steve Jobs?\u201d get answered by people with firsthand knowledge, something Google cannot provide. \u201cThere is a lot of pressure on search engines to deliver more customized, more relevant results,\u201d said Shar VanBoskirk, an analyst at Forrester. \u201cUsers don\u2019t need links to Web pages.

        "content": " LONDON \u2014  Box , an online business data storage and management company, plans to expand its sales force and team of developers by opening offices in Germany and France in coming months, building on its first overseas foray last summer in Britain. Aaron W. Levie, 28, chief executive of the privately held company, said he planned to hire about 100 people in sales, marketing and product development in Paris and Munich by the end of the year, creating a base to capture other fast-growing markets for cloud-based data storage, including Japan, Singapore, Australia and Brazil. In cloud computing, computer servers are linked to handle many tasks, like simplifying the filing and sharing of data online for companies and governments that rent them for far less than it would cost to build their own infrastructure. Box, on the smaller side of the industry, owns 10 data centers around the world and plans to add more. Box, based in Los Altos, Calif., is in a crowded field: Amazon Web Services is the leader, while Microsoft, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Google are major players. The company raised $150 million from investors last year to finance efforts to expand internationally to compete with prominent rivals like DropBox, based in San Francisco, which opened its first overseas office last year in Dublin. \u201cRight now we\u2019re in aggressive expansion mode because international expansion is really key to our strategy,\u201d Mr. Levie said in an interview in London, where he announced the plans for Europe. While he would not provide numbers, Mr. Levie said business was increasing significantly in \u201cEurope and beyond.\u201d The planned expansion to Paris and Munich, he said, was part of preparations for an anticipated initial public offering in 2014. Although the company does not disclose profit figures, Mr. Levie said that he valued the company at about $1 billion. Box, which employs about 700 in its American offices, recruited 40 more people last June for its operation in London. In September, it hired David Quantrell, a former executive at McAfee and Hewlett-Packard, to lead its business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Box says it has 150,000 business clients, and 10 million other users, charging them as little as $15 a month. No more than 15 percent of Box\u2019s revenue comes from overseas, Mr. Levie said, a figure he hopes to double in the next couple of years. Box said recently that it had signed its biggest contract yet, with the French engineering company Schneider Electric, which will use Box exclusively for its 50,000-member work force. Other Box clients include EMI Music, Volkswagen, the digital music service Spotify and Heathrow Airport Holdings, which operates Heathrow Airport. Box says its services allow business clients\u2019 employees to organize their work on multiple devices like tablets and cellphones while integrating other software like Google Docs or Salesforce.com, a Web application that helps handle large amounts of customer data. Herv\u00e9 Coureil, chief information officer at Schneider Electric, said that cloud-based storage could help companies that operate globally by cutting costs, and by providing a centralized way of tracking how they share files internally and externally. American businesses have been faster to embrace the cloud, according to the market research company IDC, with Europe lagging because of worries about data security, regulations and legal jurisdictions. IDC also said that the market for cloud-based services in the 27-member European Union was expected to grow to 10.9 billion euros, or about $14 billion, by 2014, from 4.6 billion euros in 2011. While the size of the market is still small when measured by revenue and number of users, demand is \u201chot and growing,\u201d said Alys Woodward, an analyst at IDC who covers software and services in Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s where an easy-to-use cloud service is going to cannibalize huge, more complex services like Microsoft\u2019s SharePoint,\u201d she added. SharePoint is a Web platform that helps people collaborate and share information over a corporate network. About two-thirds of European companies use cloud-based computing for at least some of their needs, primarily to handle e-mail traffic, according to an IDC survey of 1,056 companies last year. But Box sees an opportunity because those companies are not yet using the cloud to run the bulk of their businesses, including so-called content management services, the segment in which Box is aiming to grow. While businesses are unlikely ever to switch completely to the cloud and are expected to retain data on proprietary hardware devices, \u201cover time it will be a nice enhancement,\u201d said Alan Pelz-Sharpe, a research director at 451 Research.",

        "content": " Following Amazon.com, Walmart will soon allow shoppers to order items online and pick them up from lockers in local stores. The introduction of lockers is part of Walmart's effort to become a superstore online and on cellphones. It announced several e-commerce and mobile tools on Tuesday at a news event at the San Bruno, Calif., headquarters of @WalmartLabs, its digital commerce arm. ''We've dramatically accelerated customer acquisition online,'' Neil Ashe, chief executive of Walmart global e-commerce, said at the event. ''We've got to be there. We weren't there before and now we're realizing the benefit of that.'' The point, Mr. Ashe said, is to offer Walmart products anywhere a consumer wants to shop, whether in stores, online or on a phone. What he didn't say is that Walmart is also fighting Amazon, the biggest online mall, which has been encroaching on its turf. At one point, responding to a reporter's question about Amazon, Mr. Ashe asked, with a smile, ''Who?'' Though Walmart's total sales far exceed Amazon's, its e-commerce sales are a fraction of Amazon's. Walmart is on track to generate $9 billion in e-commerce revenue this year, Mr. Ashe said. Amazon's revenue, most of which comes from e-commerce, is expected to exceed $65 billion this year. Walmart's major e-commerce advantage, said Joel Anderson, chief executive of Walmart.com, is its 4,000 stores. They provide a network of distribution points for things like same-day shipping and in-store pick-up. That is particularly helpful for the quarter of Walmart customers without credit cards or bank accounts who previously were excluded from e-commerce, he said, because they can order online and pay with cash in a Walmart store. To start, the lockers will be available this summer in about a dozen stores in one market, which Walmart declined to name. Customers can avoid shipping fees and pick up their items whenever it is convenient, 24 hours a day at some stores, without interacting with a clerk. Lockers also help consumers who are not home during the day to receive packages and cut down on delivery costs and logistics for retailers. Amazon, which introduced lockers in 2011, has been expanding the service in chains like RadioShack and 7-Eleven and local stores. Google, which has been experimenting with retail delivery, recently bought a start-up called BufferBox that provides e-commerce lockers. Walmart is also testing a new home page. It has three tabs -- one for traditional online shopping, one for browsing items that are popular at the moment on Pinterest and search engines and one with personalized information from a shopper's local store. Walmart recently built a new search engine for the site, which has increased sales 20 percent, the company said. To compete online, where price and selection are most important, Walmart uses software to monitor prices at competing retailers in real time and lower its prices accordingly, said Kelly Thompson, senior vice president of merchandising. It is also doubling the inventory sold from third-party retailers in its online marketplace and tracking search data patterns and social media to choose trendy products, she said. Walmart is testing a new mobile app for shopping in stores. Shoppers can add items to their lists using voice or by scanning bar codes. When they enter the store, the app directs them to the aisles where their items are located. It keeps a running total of the items in shoppers' carts, offers digital coupons and receipts and lets people check out themselves and order items online if they are not available in the store. Already, 12 percent of e-commerce sales through Walmart's mobile app comes from shoppers using the app in Walmart stores, the company said. Over all, a third of Walmart's e-commerce traffic comes from mobile.",

        "content": " A well-financed competitor to  Amazon   Web Services became official Monday. Pivotal, a company spun out of assets of  EMC   and  VMware , two tech companies each with billions in revenue, became an independent firm, ahead of a formal introduction on  April 29 . Paul Maritz , Pivotal\u2019s chief executive, who long held senior positions at  Microsoft , left a position as chief executive at VMware to organize and run Pivotal. EMC, a big maker of data storage technology, owns a majority stake in VMware, which makes software for the efficient construction of data centers. Pivotal has drawn talent from both companies, in particular a division of EMC specialized in data analysis and prediction, and another group that works on writing software applications within cloud computing. In a letter to employees, Mr. Maritz talked about Pivotal\u2019s goal \u201cto enable customers to build a new class of applications, leveraging big and fast data, and do all of this with the power of cloud independence.\u201d Those applications would be running on privately run clouds rich in EMC and VMware products. That potentially profitable aim is joined by a very real fear of the growing power of Amazon Web Services. By running the world\u2019s largest public cloud, Amazon has lowered the demand for products at both EMC and VMware. People can rent the computing they need at the time on Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S., rather than buying and maintaining large amounts of equipment. A.W.S. has also built up an increasingly large and varied selection of software applications, lowering the need for companies to own lots of computing assets. Mr. Maritz\u2019s last great act at VMware was spending $1.26 billion on a  networking software company   that needs a lot of private clouds to succeed. Pivotal, if it can supply lots of cloud applications and services faster than Amazon can make them, could be a way of ensuring that future. The real trick, still unseen, will be showing what Pivotal can offer that is faster, more inspiring, and cheaper than A.W.S.

        "name": "Amazon to Buy Social Site Dedicated to Sharing Books ",
        "content": " Amazon , the dominant online bookseller, said late Thursday that it would buy  Goodreads , the most visited social media site built around sharing books. The companies did not disclose a purchase price or other conditions of the sale, which will close in the next quarter. With bookstores closing, Internet sites have become critical places for telling readers about books they might be interested in. This deal further consolidates Amazon\u2019s power to determine which authors get exposure for their work. Until the purchase, Goodreads was a rival to Amazon as a place for discovering books. Goodreads, which is based on networks of friends sharing reviews, was building a reputation as a reliably independent source of recommendations. It was also of great interest to publishers because members routinely shared their lists of books to be read. By contrast, Amazon had several well-publicized cases involving writers buying or manipulating their reviews on its site. As a result, authors said Amazon was  deleting reviews   from its site at the end of 2012 as a way of cracking down. The deal is made more significant because Amazon already owned part or all of Goodreads\u2019 competitors,  Shelfari   and  LibraryThing . It bought Shelfari in 2008. It also owns a portion of LibraryThing as a result of buying companies that already owned a stake in the site. Both are much smaller and have grown much more slowly than Goodreads. Otis Chandler, a founder of Goodreads, said his management team would remain in place to guard the reviewing process that had made the site attractive to its 16 million members. \u201cAmazon has a real history of building independent brands and running them as independent companies,\u201d he said in a phone interview. Reaction online, however, was swift and laced with skepticism. \u201cSay hello to a world in which Amazon targets you based on your Goodreads reviews,\u201d Edward Champion, a writer and editor,  posted on Twitter . \u201cNo company should have this power.\u201d The deal did get some support from Hugh Howey, whose book \u201cWool\u201d was originally self-published on Amazon and promoted through Goodreads and became a best seller. \u201cThe best place to discuss books is joining up with the best place to buy books \u2014 to-be-read piles everywhere must be groaning in anticipation,\u201d he said in the companies\u2019 news release. Russ Grandinetti, Amazon\u2019s vice president for Kindle content, said the integration of the companies was beneficial. For example, it will make it \u201csuper easy,\u201d he said, for authors that self-publish through Kindle \u201cto promote their books on Goodreads.\u201d",

        "content": " New York\u2019s highest court rejected arguments Thursday by two Internet retailers that they should be exempt from collecting state sales tax. Amazon.com , the biggest online store, and its much smaller competitor  Overstock.com   had separately sued to challenge a 2008 state law that required online retailers to collect sales taxes on purchases made by New York residents. That served effectively to raise prices on the sites by nearly 10 percent, reducing their competitive advantage against brick-and-mortar retailers. In a statement, Amazon denounced the New York Court of Appeals ruling as conflicting with precedents by the United States Supreme Court and decisions by other state courts. Overstock said it was considering appealing to the federal Supreme Court. Central to the dispute was the question of affiliates, which are independent sites that link to a retailer in return for a commission. Thousands of Amazon affiliates are based in New York. \u201cThe bottom line is that if a vendor is paying New York residents to actively solicit business in this state, there is no reason why that vendor should not shoulder the appropriate tax burden,\u201d the appeals court wrote in its decision. The suits had been dismissed by lower courts. The struggle over Internet taxes has intensified in the last few years. Brick-and-mortar retailers have been increasingly insistent that Amazon in particular was unfairly avoiding its responsibility to make sure its customers paid sales taxes. Other states began debating measures like New York\u2019s. In response, Amazon struck deals in California, New Jersey and a few other states to build warehouses in exchange for finally agreeing to collect taxes. In states where it does not need warehouses, Amazon has generally refused to budge. The retailer says it supports a national solution rather than a state-by-state effort. After many years of inactivity, progress is being made on that front, with a majority of United States senators indicating this month that they would support an Internet tax measure.",

''The bottom line is that if a vendor is paying New York residents to actively solicit business in this state, there is no reason why that vendor should not shoulder the appropriate tax burden,'' the appeals court wrote in its decision. The suits had been dismissed by lower courts. The struggle over Internet taxes has intensified in the last few years. Brick-and-mortar retailers have been increasingly insistent that Amazon in particular was unfairly avoiding its responsibility to make sure its customers paid sales taxes. Other states began debating measures like New York's. In response, Amazon struck deals in California, New Jersey and a few other states to build warehouses in exchange for finally agreeing to collect taxes. In states where it does not need warehouses, Amazon has generally refused to budge. The retailer says it supports a national solution rather than a state-by-state effort. After many years of inactivity, progress is being made on that front, with a majority of United States senators indicating this month that they would support an Internet tax measure.",

        "content": " Amazon, the dominant online bookseller, said late Thursday that it would buy Goodreads, the most visited social media site built around sharing books. The companies did not disclose a purchase price or other conditions of the sale, which will close in the next quarter. With bookstores closing, Internet sites have become critical places for telling readers about books they might be interested in. This deal further consolidates Amazon's power to determine which authors get exposure for their work. Until the purchase, Goodreads was a rival to Amazon as a place for discovering books. Goodreads, which is based on networks of friends sharing reviews, was building a reputation as a reliably independent source of recommendations. It was also of great interest to publishers because members routinely shared their lists of books to be read. By contrast, Amazon had several well-publicized cases involving writers buying or manipulating their reviews on its site. As a result, authors said Amazon was deleting reviews from its site at the end of 2012 as a way of cracking down. The deal is made more significant because Amazon already owned part or all of Goodreads' competitors, Shelfari and LibraryThing. It bought Shelfari in 2008. It also owns a portion of LibraryThing as a result of buying companies that already owned a stake in the site. Both are much smaller and have grown much more slowly than Goodreads. Otis Chandler, a founder of Goodreads, said his management team would remain in place to guard the reviewing process that had made the site attractive to its 16 million members. ''Amazon has a real history of building independent brands and running them as independent companies,'' he said in a phone interview. Reaction online, however, was swift and laced with skepticism. ''Say hello to a world in which Amazon targets you based on your Goodreads reviews,'' Edward Champion, a writer and editor, posted on Twitter. ''No company should have this power.'' The deal did get some support from Hugh Howey, whose book ''Wool'' was originally self-published on Amazon and promoted through Goodreads and became a best seller. ''The best place to discuss books is joining up with the best place to buy books -- to-be-read piles everywhere must be groaning in anticipation,'' he said in the companies' news release. Russ Grandinetti, Amazon's vice president for Kindle content, said the integration of the companies was beneficial. For example, it will make it ''super easy,'' he said, for authors that self-publish through Kindle ''to promote their books on Goodreads.''

        "content": " Networks never seem to absorb lessons of lineup changes gone bad,  NBC   most of all,  Alessandra Stanley writes . Matt Lauer, the host of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, who may be on the way out, was admirably suave onscreen despite reports that NBC may be seeking a new host. Mr. Lauer\u2019s problems began with his succession last year, when many viewers blamed him when his co-anchor  Ann Curry   was clumsily cast aside. The drama is not new. More than 20 years ago, NBC replaced Jane Pauley with the younger Deborah Norville; that \u201cToday\u201d show shakeup became a founding fiasco of morning television, and Ms. Norville\u2019s career never recovered. Barbara Walters , the host of the ABC daytime program \u201cThe View,\u201d whose television career has lasted more than 50 years, will retire in 2014,  Bill Carter reports . An executive familiar with Ms. Walters\u2019s plans said she would announce her decision this May and that the following year would include a number of retrospectives and specials about her career. Ms. Walters\u2019s health became a national story this year after she suffered a concussion in Washington and developed an infection that turned out to be chicken pox. Jeffrey Zucker , the new head of CNN, announced Thursday that he would pair Christopher Cuomo, a former ABC anchor he hired in May, with a young Washington correspondent named Kate Bolduan to host a new morning show,  Brian Stelter writes . The show will premier in late spring and will replace \u201cStarting Point,\u201d which is hosted by Soledad O\u2019Brien and has done poorly in the ratings. FX Networks announced that it would add a third channel to its lineup and step up its commitment to original scripted series at an upfront presentation on Thursday,  Stuart Elliott writes . The new cable channel, FXX, will be aimed at viewers ages 18 to 34 and will coincide with FX\u2019s introduction of TV everywhere, industry shorthand for technology that lets paying viewers stream content on devices at any time. Amazon.com , the dominant online bookseller, said on Thursday that it would buy Goodreads, the most visited social media site based around sharing books,  Leslie Kaufman reports . Internet sites have become critical places for telling readers about interesting books as bookstores close. The companies did not disclose a purchase price or conditions of the sale, which will close in the next quarter. Madison Avenue and the automotive industry are fretting over ways to attract millennials to cars and car culture,  Stuart Elliott reports . Younger people are buying fewer cars, whether because of shaky finances or lack of interest. Manufacturers like  Toyota , which is adding content like music to a new Web site for its Scion brand and beginning to advertise in Teen Vogue, are trying appeal to them. The third season of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the  HBO   adaptation of George R. R. Martin\u2019s \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d novels, begins with a satisfying slaughter but then falls into a familiar pattern of bursts of action interspersed with lengthening periods of dialogue,  Mike Hale writes . Though the intricate fantasy is certainly enjoyable, claims that it is the best show on television may be overblown. Bob Teague, who joined WNBC-TV in 1963 as one of the city\u2019s first black journalists and worked in various roles in TV news for more than three decades, died on Thursday in New Brunswick, N.J., at 83,  Douglas Martin reports .

        "name": "Actress Can Sue IMDb.com For Disclosing Her Real Age ",
        "content": " LOS ANGELES -- Junie Hoang, the actress who sued Amazon and its Internet Movie Database unit for posting her age, can take her complaint -- or at least some of it -- to a jury. Judge Marsha J. Pechman, of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, ruled on Monday that Ms. Hoang, whose legal name is Huong Hoang, could proceed to trial with a breach of contract claim and a request for damages related to her career. But Judge Pechman excluded Amazon as a defendant, leaving only its IMDb unit in the suit; barred any claim by Ms. Hoang for emotional distress; and granted summary judgment denying a claim that the database had violated the Consumer Protection Act by publishing Ms. Hoang's age without her consent. ''Anyone who values their privacy and has ever given credit card information to an online company like IMDb or Amazon.com should be concerned about the outcome,'' Ms. Hoang said Tuesday in a statement. A call to Amazon's media relations department drew no immediate response. In 2011, Ms. Hoang, who is now 41 years old, filed a complaint that said IMDb.com, a widely used film and television database, had illegally used her credit card information to obtain and post her age. The disclosure, she said, exposed her to age discrimination in an industry that values youth -- a claim that was bolstered by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which publicly criticized IMDb for posting the ages of performers and others. In her order on Monday, Judge Pechman described a series of communications in which Ms. Hoang had first omitted her age when subscribing to IMDb, then submitted a false date of birth that made her appear to be seven years younger than her actual age. Eventually, Judge Pechman noted, Ms. Hoang asked IMDb to remove the false birth date, going so far as to submit a fake Texas identification document to show that it was wrong. Instead of relying on the fake document, the judge said, an IMDb employee gained access to Ms. Hoang's credit card information, then used that to ascertain her actual 1971 birth date from a public records database called PrivateEye. Ms. Hoang's misrepresentations, the judge said, were not sufficient to bar her claim. But whether IMDb had breached its contract with her, or is liable for damages, must be decided at trial, she said. In an order issued last August, Judge Pechman set the trial date on April 8 of this year. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",

        "name": "Google Elbows Into the Cloud ",
        "content": " In a battle for dominance in cloud computing,  Google   is taking on  Microsoft   and  Amazon   in their own back yard. Google said Tuesday that it was doubling its office space near Seattle, just miles from the campuses of Amazon and Microsoft, and stepping up the hiring of engineers and others who work on cloud technology. It is part of Google\u2019s dive into a business known as cloud services \u2014 renting to other businesses access to its enormous data storage and computing power, accessible by the Internet. In cloud computing, dozens or even thousands of computer servers are joined to create a giant machine capable of handling many tasks at once, from storing data to running Web sites and mobile apps to tackling complicated analytical problems. Individual software developers, large companies and governments rent these services to run their operations often at a fraction of the cost of buying and managing their own machines. Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S.,  is far and away the leader   in this area. Amazon expects that this business will eventually be as big as its retail operation. A.W.S. is followed by Microsoft\u2019s Windows Azure and offerings from other companies including Rackspace, Verizon, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. Google says the cloud business is a new source of profit and a way to improve the Internet by providing other companies access to its sophisticated computing services. Analysts say it is also a strategy to lure developers and businesses to use Google products instead of those of archrivals like Amazon and Microsoft. The cloud business has become so vital to these companies, said James Staten, an analyst at Forrester, because it is crucial to other businesses like mobile apps and online video and music. Most of the apps that run on Google Android phones, for instance, are built using Amazon\u2019s cloud, and Google would like to wrest back control. Microsoft, Amazon and Google are all competing to host online video, a booming business that relies on cloud services. \u201cAlmost every major consultancy supports Amazon; almost every advertising agency runs on Amazon; if I need to hire 10 people tomorrow to help me build my application, it\u2019s super easy to find people who have Amazon experience,\u201d Mr. Staten said. Google plans a major recruiting effort to increase its Seattle-area engineering staff by as much as five times. There is already  fierce competition   among tech companies for talented engineers, and many of those with skills in cloud computing work at Google\u2019s rivals in Seattle. \u201cWe\u2019re not the first in this rodeo, but we have the history of Google,\u201d said Brian Goldfarb, Google\u2019s leader of cloud platform marketing, who joined the company last year after a decade at Microsoft. \u201cWe have the best data centers on the planet. You can\u2019t really give engineers a bigger, badder thing to work on.\u201d Google is also adding 180,000 square feet to its office in Kirkland, Wash., which together with its Seattle office already houses more than 1,000 employees, making it Google\u2019s third largest in the country after its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., and its office in New York. The new office space will have all the requisite perks of tech businesses, where typical office cubicles and fluorescent lights are not enough. It will meet green building standards, with a solar roof and wood from recycled shipping containers. The Seattle office, on a canal, has kayaks and paddleboards for employees, and the Kirkland office uses boats for conference rooms, not to mention the office\u2019s espresso bars, massage parlor and climbing wall. Though the cloud business is still in its early days, Google is already late to the game. Over the years, Google, Amazon and Microsoft had each built world-class clouds, consisting of several giant data centers in different countries, to run their own businesses \u2014 doing things like searching the Web, hosting online video, managing business software and operating an online mall. Amazon was the first to rent its data storage and computing power to outside customers when it started A.W.S. in 2004, and Microsoft and Google followed. Another company with huge data centers and computing power, Apple, does not rent its cloud. Amazon earned $800 million from its cloud services last year, according to analyst estimates. It initially focused on start-up Web companies, but has gone on to offer features like e-mail and database search that are attractive to more mainstream corporate customers, including the InterContinental Hotels Group, Samsung and Netflix. \u201cThis is replacing the corporate data center,\u201d said Adam Selipsky, who runs A.W.S. \u201cThat shows you how much we have to do. It is a \u2018couple of decades\u2019 project.\u201d Microsoft started Azure to try to hold on to corporate customers that Amazon wants to pry away, and has struggled for years to adapt its business from selling individual software packages to renting software over the cloud. Google\u2019s cloud offerings originally tied to other Google services. But to reach a broader market, Google has followed Amazon\u2019s lead by offering a cloud platform that works with a much broader range of services, Mr. Staten said. Google has the weakest corporate ties. It sells businesses cloud-based word processing, storage, and spreadsheet tools, but its operation is  still much smaller   than Microsoft\u2019s. It introduced the Google App Engine, for building and hosting Web and mobile apps on Google\u2019s cloud, in 2004. The company says that 250,000 developers use it to run 1 million apps that generate up to 7.5 billion page hits a day. In June, Google announced Compute Engine, for large-scale computing and data center access, at its annual conference for software developers, in the hope that developers and eventually big companies would use it. But nearly a year later, it is still in a test phase and not open to the public. People who have used Google\u2019s cloud business say it is inexpensive and capable, but lacks some features of A.W.S. Google has said its cloud services will cost about 50 percent less than competing products. If Google wants a price war, Mr. Selipsky said, Amazon is ready. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been very good at making everything as low-cost as possible,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we lower it some more.\u201d Google Concedes That Drive-by Prying Violated Privacy",

        "content": " Why do some parties, companies and cities work, while others don't? It takes some social engineering to foster serendipity and creativity. ''You want to get all these creative people in a statistically small space,'' says Tony Hsieh, who built an effective company culture at Zappos.com, an online vendor of shoes and apparel. If that is the goal, it is another argument for Yahoo's decision to ban people from working from home. ''We allow some people at Zappos to work from home, but we don't want them to,'' Mr. Hsieh says. ''We want them to come in to work.'' Part of his job, he says, is creating an environment where they would rather be. Mr. Hsieh sold Zappos to Amazon.com for $1.2 billion in 2009. He continues to run it. He is also testing the lessons he learned in building Zappos in an effort to revive downtown Las Vegas, which is near Zappos's headquarters. Both company building and community construction, he says, are like good parties. ''I was always interested in flow, and how to get people not stuck into always talking with the same people,'' he says. This might involve changing the entertainment, moving the bar over the course of the evening or designing the room so people move through different-size spaces. The overall idea is to make people encounter strangers in a way that creates a sense of connection, something he instilled at Zappos. ''I wanted managers to spend 10 to 20 percent of their time outside of the office, leading the team,'' he says. Dinners, hiking and other encounters with colleagues increased productivity by a range of 20 percent to 100 percent. ''There was more trust, better communications, more use of shorthand in e-mails, because people weren't afraid of miscommunication,'' Mr. Hsieh says. Likewise, offices were kept dense so people would bump into each other more. ''When someone moves twice as far away, it's exponentially less contact,'' he says. ''The parking lot was behind the building, and we made people walk around from the front.'' Staying physically close may be part of Marissa Mayer's plan to end working from home at Yahoo. Google, the company she comes from, is known for tight offices, frequently with three people in what normally would be space for one. This used to be ascribed to cheapness, or morale building, but it may be an effort to bolster productivity. Mr. Hsieh's effort to make these principles work for a decaying city is called the Downtown Project. In addition to financing start-up companies in the same buildings, he has opened an office where people will have to walk two blocks to their cars, so they are on the street with other people. The Downtown Project staff is moving into the Las Vegas City Hall, which is dismantling its air-cooled sky bridge so people meet other workers and townspeople in an outdoor plaza. The apartment building he lives in, near downtown Las Vegas (historically a more tawdry and luckless place than the glitzy strip), has lots of other people from Zappos, start-ups and the Downtown Project. The building also has a number of extra places for potential investors and hires to stay a few days. Hanging around, he says, is its own recruiting tool. Mr. Hsieh was speaking to entrepreneurs and investors at a Montgomery & Company conference in Santa Monica, Calif., hoping to attract interest in downtown Las Vegas or in similar projects elsewhere. ''The idea is to create collisions, co-learning and community,'' he says. ''It's something repeatable that any city can do. You don't have to have a sports team or a big university like Harvard or Stanford.''",

        "name": "Keep Calm and Carry On... Buying ",
        "content": " OUR fully automated, meme-conscious information economy might seem a paradise of reason and rationality. But it also has a seamier, surreal side. Just consider how the phrase \u201c Keep Calm and Rape a Lot \u201d came to appear on T-shirts sold on  Amazon.co.uk . What fool decided to design and sell such clothing? That\u2019s the problem: no one did. They were the unfortunate but revealing result of an algorithm that generates random phrases and slaps them on print-on-demand T-shirts, on the odd chance that someone might buy them. The T-shirts come from Solid Gold Bomb, a company that tried to parody the phrase \u201cKeep Calm and Carry On,\u201d originally the text of a World War II propaganda poster undergoing a sudden cultural renaissance. Having found its golden meme, Solid Gold Bomb wrote a computer script to churn out hundreds of T-shirt designs riffing on the phrase \u2014 \u201cKeep Calm and Dream On\u201d to \u201cKeep Calm and Dance Off.\u201d In theory, Solid Gold Bomb could be selling billions of them, for they only become \u201creal\u201d once an order is made. It\u2019s the infinite monkey theorem, applied to products: with time, the algorithms would produce a T-shirt someone wants. Amazon does not vet such items, and Solid Gold Bomb is too solid to care. The advent of 3D printing will create an explosion in such phantom products. Books got there first: Amazon brims with algorithmically produced \u201cliterature.\u201d Philip M. Parker, a marketing professor, must be the most productive, erudite writer in history: Amazon lists him as author of more than 100,000 books. His secret? An algorithm to generate page-turners like \u201cWebster\u2019s Estonian to English Crossword Puzzles\u201d and \u201cThe 2007-2012 Outlook for Premoistened Towelettes and Baby Wipes in Greater China\u201d (\u201cThe moist towelette is an essential part of the lunchbox, and with the new global economy, this volume is essential,\u201d reads its only review). Some of these books might be useful, but much of algorithmic literature exists for one reason: to swindle unsuspecting customers. When the former Wired editor Chris Anderson wrote of \u201cthe long tail\u201d \u2014 the idea that, thanks to the Internet, companies can look beyond blockbusters and make money on obscure products \u2014 he never warned us it would be so long and so ugly. Somehow, well-crafted niche products have surrendered to algorithmic schlock. But while algorithms, 3D printers and Web stores have solved the supply problem, demand-side uncertainties remain. If there are, indeed, psychopaths who want a \u201cKeep Calm and Rape a Lot\u201d T-shirt, how do they find it? Or, rather, how does it find them? Whoever matches existing weirdos with nonexisting weird trinkets could be the next Google. Or could that dubious honor go to Google itself? Organizing the world\u2019s information was just prelude to a far more important goal: becoming a universal shopping gateway. Last week\u2019s news that it will introduce Shopping Express, a same-day delivery service to contend with Amazon, confirms the obvious: shopping is essential to Google\u2019s future. By analyzing our information streams, it can predict what purchases make us happy, and remind us to keep shopping. It already underpins the Google\u2019s most intriguing smartphone app, Field Trip. A future of frictionless, continuous shopping fits with Google\u2019s vision for a world where we no longer need to search for anything, since we ourselves are perpetually monitored, with the relevant product or information sent to us based on perceived need. \u201cAutonomous search,\u201d they call it. Ray Kurzweil, Google\u2019s director of engineering, even wants to give us a \u201c cybernetic friend \u201d that could satisfy our wants before we are aware of them. By monitoring our conversations, e-mails and reading habits, he said, \u201cit may pop up and say: \u2018Well, you mentioned two weeks ago you were worried that vitamin B12 isn\u2019t getting into your cells. There was new research just released two seconds ago that speaks to that.\u2019\u201d To Mr. Kurzweil, who once confessed to taking 250 nutritional supplements a day, this might be a useful service. As for the rest of us, I\u2019m not so sure: according to Google Scholar, 13,000 scientific papers and books that mention vitamin B12 came out last year alone. While Google promises to quell our information hunger, that hunger will only intensify once a few seemingly innocent factoids are thrown our way.

        "name": "Reselling the E-Goods ",
        "content": " The paperback of ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' is exactly like the digital version except for this: If you hate the paperback, you can give it away or resell it. If you hate the e-book, you're stuck with it. The retailer's button might say ''buy now,'' but you are in effect only renting an e-book -- or an iTunes song -- and your rights are severely limited. That has been the bedrock distinction between physical and electronic works since digital goods became widely available a decade ago. That distinction is now under attack, both in the courts and the marketplace, and it could shake up the already beleaguered book and music industries. Amazon and Apple, the two biggest forces in electronic goods, are once again at the center of the turmoil. In late January, Amazon received a patent to set up an exchange for all sorts of digital material. The retailer would presumably earn a commission on each transaction, and consumers would surely see lower prices. But a shudder went through publishers and media companies. Those who produce content might see their work devalued, just as they did when Amazon began selling secondhand books 13 years ago. The price on the Internet for many used books these days is a penny. On Thursday, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published Apple's application for its own patent for a digital marketplace. Apple's application outlines a system for allowing users to sell or give e-books, music, movies and software to each other by transferring files rather than reproducing them. Such a system would permit only one user to have a copy at any one time. Meanwhile, a New York court is poised to rule on whether a start-up that created a way for people to buy and sell iTunes songs is breaking copyright law. A victory for the company would mean that consumers would not need either Apple's or Amazon's exchange to resell their digital items. Electronic bazaars would spring up instantly. ''The technology to allow the resale of digital goods is now in place, and it will cause a dramatic upheaval,'' said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps, a technology consulting firm. ''In the short term, it's great for consumers. Over the long term, however, it could seriously reduce creators' incentive to create.'' Scott Turow, the best-selling novelist and president of the Authors Guild, sees immediate peril in the prospect of a secondhand digital thrift shop. ''The resale of e-books would send the price of new books crashing,'' he said. ''Who would want to be the sucker who buys the book at full price when a week later everyone else can buy it for a penny?'' He acknowledged it would be good for consumers -- ''until there were no more authors anymore.'' Libraries, though, welcome the possibility of loosened restrictions on digital material. ''The vast majority of e-books are not available in your public library,'' said Brandon Butler, director of public policy initiatives for the Association of Research Libraries. ''That's pathetic.'' He said that 60 percent of what the association's 125 members buy was electronic, which meant sharp restrictions on use. Libraries cannot buy from Apple's iTunes, he said. And so, for example, Pixar's Oscar-winning soundtrack for the movie ''Up'' is not available in any public collection. An Apple spokesman confirmed this. ''If these things can't be owned, who is going to make sure they exist going forward?'' Mr. Butler asked. ''Without substantial changes, we can't do what libraries have always done, which is lend and preserve.'' For over a century, the ability of consumers, secondhand bookstores and libraries to do whatever they wanted with a physical book has been enshrined in law. The crucial 1908 case involved a publisher that issued a novel with a warning that no one was allowed to sell it for less than $1. When Macy's offered the book for 89 cents, the publisher sued. That led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling limiting the copyright owner's control to the first sale. After that, it was a free market. Sales of digital material are considered licenses, which give consumers little or no ability to lend the item. The worry is that without such constraints digital goods could be infinitely reproduced while still in the possession of the original owner. Both the Amazon and Apple systems aim to solve this problem. Amazon's patent envisions a book or movie or song being kept in a customer's personalized ''data store.'' When an item is no longer wanted, the user could sell or trade it to another user, an action that would automatically delete the item from the first user's store. The patent describes what is essentially a gigantic swap meet. Amazon's 152 million active customers would maintain a list of desired secondhand digital objects (''Django Unchained'' or Cheryl Strayed's ''Wild''), as well as a list of used digital objects that are ''available for movement'' (''Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance'' or Lance Armstrong's autobiography). An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on the patent, including how soon or even whether the digital marketplace would be set up. The patent does not make clear if such a bazaar would need the publishers' permission. The degree to which media companies are against secondhand digital marketplaces can be seen in the music industry's hard line toward ReDigi, a Massachusetts start-up that allows for the reselling of iTunes songs. ReDigi took some pains to make its approach as friendly to the music companies as possible. For instance, any money gained from selling songs must be spent on new songs. And ReDigi says its system, like both Amazon's and Apple's, allows for only one copy of an electronic product to exist at any one moment. Capitol Records nonetheless sued ReDigi for copyright infringement in a New York federal court and asked the judge to shut the service through a preliminary injunction. The judge declined. He is expected to rule on the merits of the case shortly. An Apple spokesman did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the company's patent application, which was first reported on Apple Insider. Apple, which has not sued ReDigi, declined to comment on the court case. John Ossenmacher, ReDigi's chief executive, said he was heartened by Amazon's resale patent. ''Amazon is pretty fearless, which bodes well for the consumers of digital goods.'' And, he added, for Amazon itself. ''What better value to give an Amazon customer than to say, 'Buy your book here and then later you can resell it'? You can't do that with Barnes & Noble's Nook.'' Robert Levine, author of ''Free Ride,'' an account of how Silicon Valley rose to power by plundering the traditional media companies, said he believed there was a cultural imperative to loosen the restrictions on digital entertainment -- but not too much. Before the Internet, he pointed out, there was little controversy over secondhand stores for books and music. ''It never threatened the broader market because it simply wasn't that efficient,'' he said. ''You couldn't always find the book or CD you were looking for.'' Amazon, which caused an uproar with writers and publishers when it started selling used books in 2000, made it as easy as clicking a button. ''Digital resale would change it even more,'' Mr. Levine said. Markets usually move toward a solution both sides can live with, he noted. ''But that happens slowly, and in the meantime we're in for one hell of a fight.'' A diagram accompanying Amazon's new patent for an exchange of secondhand digital material.

        "content": " Once you have figured out how to put your baby to sleep, and even if you have managed to get some sleep yourself, you\u2019ll probably still be too exhausted to address the many ways your little one is likely to affect your financial life. So this week\u2019s  Your Money column   tries to compile the many money-related tasks and decisions you will face as a new parent in a giant guide. We didn\u2019t have the space to print every single item on the to-do list, so we\u2019ve listed some more of them below. Please add your own in the comment section. Budget for Help Consider what kind of support system you\u2019ll have in the early days after you take the baby home. If the father has to go back to work and a new mother doesn\u2019t have family or friends nearby, it may make sense to budget for a   doula , night nurse, babysitter or housecleaner for some much-needed relief. Take That Babymoon It may seem like silly or obvious advice, but it may be a while before the two of you can escape as a couple. \u201cYou\u2019ll miss this, quickly feel the pull of \u2018saving money\u2019 and find yourself three years out without having taken any trips,\u201d said Kristin Harad, a financial planner in San Francisco whose firm, Vitavie Financial Planning, focuses on new parents. Subscribe to Everything If you live near one of the big warehouse clubs, this is probably a good place to start buying diapers and related baby items in bulk. But if you live in a city without a car, think about subscribing to everything. I no longer have time to think about what we\u2019re running low on, so, after much research, I decided to start monthly or bimonthly subscriptions, through   Amazon.com , to diapers, baby wipes and a variety of sundries. The deals aren\u2019t going to blow you away, but many items cost about what you would pay at a wholesale club and they\u2019re delivered to your doorstep. More on Estate Planning In addition to the steps laid out in the column, each parent should also create a durable power of attorney, which allows a person to handle your financial affairs if you become incapacitated. Estate planning experts also recommend creating medical directives. These will vary depending on where you live, but they generally include documents that will appoint a person to make medical decisions on your behalf if you cannot make them for yourself, as well as instructions on life support. Letters of Instruction Lauren Lindsay, director of financial planning at   Personal Financial Advisors , created a letter of instruction for the guardian and trustee she appointed in her will for her daughter. It essentially outlines how she would like her daughter\u2019s money to be spent. \u201cThis is not binding but made me feel better,\u201d she added.

        "name": "Networks feel heat as unexpected rivals pursue Internet TV; Web-delivered programs are latest front in battle for viewers\u2019 attention ",
        "content": " In the television pilot that Cheyenne Jackson taped recently, he played an aggressive young news anchor whose ascendancy threatened an older colleague. It was a fitting metaphor for the industry itself, because while Mr. Jackson had taped pilots for the networks ABC and NBC and the cable channel USA before, this was his first time doing one for a new challenger to those alphabet networks: Amazon.com . When Amazon sizes up the television marketplace, it sees opportunity. Internet-delivered television, which until recently was unready for prime time, is the new front in the war for the public\u2019s attention span. Netflix , the online video rental company, is following up on the $100 million drama \u2018\u2018House of Cards\u2019\u2019 with four more series this year. The computer giant Microsoft is producing programming for the Xbox video game console with the help of a former president of CBS. Other companies, including the Internet company AOL, the electronics giant Sony and the social messaging service Twitter , are likely to follow. The companies are, in effect, creating new networks for television through broadband pipes and also giving rise to new rivalries \u2014 with one another, as seen between Amazon and Netflix , and with the big but vulnerable broadcast networks as well. \u2018\u2018These are the very first lab tests in a very grand experiment,\u2019\u2019 said Jeff Berman, the president of BermanBraun, a media company that makes programming for the network NBC , the cable channel HGTV, AOL and the video site YouTube , among others. As he suggested, the competition has only just begun. Amazon is making pilot episodes for at least six comedies and five children\u2019s shows, with more to be announced soon. Sometime this spring it will put the episodes on its Amazon Prime Instant Video service and ask customers which ones they like, then order full seasons of some of them. Netflix has been ordering entire seasons of its shows without seeing pilots first. Reed Hastings, Netflix \u2019s chief executive, said last week that \u2018\u2018House of Cards,\u2019\u2019 the political thriller starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright , had been a \u2018\u2018great success\u2019\u2019 for the company. Its next program, a horror series called \u2018\u2018Hemlock Grove\u2019\u2019 from the film director Eli Roth , will have its premiere in April. Microsoft has said comparatively little about its plans. But all three companies are commissioning shows because they have millions of people on monthly or yearly subscription plans. Though the shows may be loss leaders, executives say that having exclusive content increases the likelihood that existing subscribers will keep paying and that new ones will sign up. The proliferation of shows is generally seen as a good thing for viewers, who have more choices about what to watch and when, and for producers and actors, who have more places to be seen and heard. But the trend may inflame cable companies\u2019 concerns about cord-cutting by subscribers who decide there is enough to watch online. At the same time, the rise of Internet-only shows may make viewers depend more on the broadband cord. In many cases, though, both cable and broadband are supplied by the same company. Unlike the early stabs at Internet television, these shows look and feel like traditional television. That is partly because more people are watching Internet content on big-screen televisions, but it is mostly because the companies involved are throwing money at the screens: each of the Amazon comedy pilots cost the company more than $1 million, according to people involved in their production, which is less than the $2 million invested in a broadcast comedy pilot, but more than is typically invested in cable pilots. Not only are the budgets comparable, so are the perks for actors and creators \u2014 like trailers and car-service pickups. The writers are guild members. The actors have what people involved say are standard television contracts, with options for several seasons if shows succeed. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s absolutely no difference\u2019\u2019 between TV and these new productions, said Jeffrey Tambor, who starred in the cable channel HBO\u2019s \u2018\u2018Larry Sanders Show,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Arrested Development\u2019\u2019 on the Fox network. Now, at 68, he is an online pioneer: this year he reprised his character for Netflix \u2019s new season of \u2018\u2018Arrested,\u2019\u2019 which premieres in May. While taping that show, he read the script for \u2018\u2018The Onion Presents: The News,\u2019\u2019 an Amazon pilot. He signed up, and played the older rival to Cheyenne Jackson. The \u2018\u2018Onion\u2019\u2019 producers took over half of the newsroom of NY1, a New York news channel, in mid-February and reimagined it as the headquarters of an unscrupulous news corporation . For most of the actors there, like Mr. Jackson, a Broadway star whose television credits include \u2018\u201830 Rock\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Glee,\u2019\u2019 the taping was their one pilot of the season \u2014 and thus represented a bet on Amazon over the broadcasters. Mr. Jackson recalled that his manager had called about \u2018\u2018The Onion\u2019\u2019 with a note of apprehension in her voice. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s online,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018We have to talk about this.\u2019\u2019 But when he read the script, he said, he felt confident \u2014 the tone of it reminded him of \u2018\u201830 Rock.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018This is kind of a leap of faith,\u2019\u2019 he said between tapings. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re all taking a leap together.\u2019\u2019 Analysts say they expect more investment to come, including from companies that do not have monthly subscribers to please. YouTube , for instance, the biggest video Web site of all, makes its money from ads, not from subscriptions. But it has paid dozens of outside producers to start channels so that it has original, professional content. And its owner, Google , can afford to pay many more. Similar logic is motivating cable channels, each of which receives a small piece of cable subscribers\u2019 monthly payments, to come up with more dramas and sitcoms that they can call their own. This brings up a conundrum, of course: too much great TV to watch, and not enough time. \u2018\u2018Viewers find organizing and managing all of their beloved TV options to be a bit stressful,\u2019\u2019 said Christy Tanner, the chief executive of TVGuide.com, which conducted research that found respondents who said \u2018\u2018it feels like work\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018I\u2019m afraid of missing something.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": " One of the biggest suppliers of programming for PBS, WGBH, is the latest to climb aboard Amazon\u2019s television pilot process. Amazon\u2019s production arm  said Wednesday   that it had ordered a children\u2019s pilot called \u201cSara Solves It,\u201d which was co-developed by WGBH (the powerhouse public television station in Boston) and Out of the Blue Enterprises, a production company co-founded by Angela Santomero, whose credits include Nickelodeon\u2019s long-running series \u201cBlue\u2019s Clues.\u201d \u201cSara Solves It\u201d is the sixth children\u2019s pilot commissioned by Amazon, which is entering the original television space for the first time. Once the pilot episodes are completed, they will be posted on Amazon\u2019s streaming video service, called Prime Instant Video; viewer feedback will play a role in Amazon\u2019s decisions about which become series, and which get shelved. WBGH and Ms. Santomero\u2019s willingness to sell their show idea to Amazon attests to Amazon\u2019s willingness to  invest in original content.   Carol Greenwald, the senior executive producer of children\u2019s programs for WGBH, said in a statement, \u201cWe are excited to be part of Amazon Studios\u2019 innovative approach of getting high-quality programming directly into the hands of parents and children.\u201d The new pilot announcement comes at a time of intense rivalry between Amazon and a much bigger streaming video service, Netflix. Last month,  Netflix announced   its first step into original children\u2019s programming in cooperation with DreamWorks Animation. DreamWorks is making a cartoon series called \u201cTurbo: F.A.S.T.\u201d for the service, based on its forthcoming film \u201cTurbo.\u201d The film comes out in July; the Netflix series is scheduled to come online in December. The two streaming services are also competing with programming for adults. Netflix has five original dramas and comedy series premiering this year, and Amazon has a set of comedy pilots in production. Amazon has publicly identified six such pilots, and there are two others that have not formally announced by the company. The pilot episodes, at least of the six, are expected to be posted online sometime this spring. \u2018Downton\u2019 Finale Seen by 8.2 Million  Viewers Does the \u2018House of Cards\u2019 All-You-Can-Eat Buffet Spoil Social  Viewing?

Now they\u2019re making money from domestic violence,\u201d the former Labour deputy leader, John Prescott,  said on Twitter , according to  The Independent newspaper . The T-shirts, which sold for about $25, were produced by Solid Gold Bomb, an Australian start-up. In  a lengthy   and profuse apology   on Solid Gold Bomb\u2019s Web site, Michael Fowler, the founder, said it was all a case of Big Data run amok. \u201cThis was a computer error,\u201d he wrote. Solid Gold Bomb was apparently trying to generate parodies of the iconic expression \u201cKeep Calm,\u201d and many of them turned out to be offensive, although no one at the company noticed. \u201cThese items sat online and on nonindexed servers for the last year and myself and our company had no idea of the issue,\u201d he said.

Amazon removed the shirts from sale, declining to say much to the British media \u2014 no surprise there. But it sells so much from so many vendors that it generally relies on complaints to monitor its virtual racks rather than vetting each item. All of this sounds like a parody of a 1960s sci-fi movie where the computers take over and they decide, based on bad data, that the world must end.

        "name": "Amazon\u2019s Labor Relations Under Scrutiny in Germany ",
        "content": " BAD HERSFELD, GERMANY \u2014 Manuel Sauer, a union activist, stood in front of  Amazon \u2019s colossal gray distribution center here last Thursday, masquerading as the company\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, by holding up a cardboard cutout of a scowling Mr. Bezos. Television crews crowded in for the money shot. Then Mr. Sauer and several other activists unfurled a banner demanding in a curious mix of German and English that Amazon, the American online retailing juggernaut, negotiate a union wage contract with its currently nonunion work force here. \u201cMake Tarif Vertrag,\u201d it said in fluorescent letters. Then the organizers marched toward the gates of the Amazon complex to deliver the results of an online petition drive supporting the union\u2019s demands. That brief bit of guerrilla theater was the latest skirmish in an escalating battle between ver.di, one of the largest unions in Germany, and Amazon, which employs 8,000 permanent workers at eight distribution centers in the country, one of the online retailer\u2019s largest markets outside the United States. Deservedly or not, Amazon\u2019s labor relations have lately come under intense scrutiny by German media. The triggering event was a Feb. 12 broadcast by one of Germany\u2019s two main public television networks of a documentary about the treatment of some of the 10,000 temporary workers that Amazon hired last year to cope with the holiday rush. Many of those workers were bused in from countries like Spain or Romania where jobs are scarce. Aired on ARD, a publicly financed broadcaster considered left of center, the documentary even implied that Amazon used neo-Nazi thugs to keep workers in line. It showed a team of security workers hired by an Amazon subcontractor roughing up a camera crew outside the temporary workers\u2019 quarters. The broadcast has since inspired countless headlines, preoccupied pundits on Germany\u2019s ubiquitous television talk shows and may even become an issue in national elections this autumn in which left-leaning Social Democrats will be challenging the government coalition led by Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats. The continuing furor raises the question of whether Amazon will be the latest big American company to run afoul of German labor laws, which provide much broader worker rights than in the United States. Walmart abandoned Germany in 2006 following an array of setbacks that included a legal struggle with ver.di, which represents two million workers in service industries including retailing, hotels, food service and public transportation. The name is an abbreviation of Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft, or United Service Industries Union. General Motor\u2019s Opel unit, represented by the IG Metall union in Germany, has struggled for more than a decade to cut costs and stem losses in the face of strong worker resistance. Last week, Opel finally struck a truce with its employees that will allow it to close a factory in Bochum, Germany, in 2016 \u2014 but only after promising not to impose involuntary layoffs. Now it seems to be Amazon\u2019s turn to serve as a symbol for everything that many Germans resent about American-style management and so-called Anglo-Saxon capitalism. As an American company that has helped drive at least one German competitor out of business and makes heavy use of temporary workers, Amazon is a ripe target. More flexible job regulations, introduced since 2005, have contributed to a plunge in unemployment. Germany\u2019s 5.3 percent jobless rate is less than half the euro zone\u2019s overall rate of 11.9 percent. But the changes are perceived by many Germans as creating a class of poorly paid workers with few protections. Amazon\u2019s work force more than doubles every Christmas season when it hires an additional 10,000 temporary employees, many of them foreigners. Amazon, which already pays above the union rate, has refused to negotiate with the ver.di union on wages or any other issue. But so far Amazon seems to be doing a better job than Walmart did in German public relations. Some of the security agents in the documentary who manhandled a camera crew wore clothing fashionable among neo-Nazis. The name of the security firm, as the film made clear, was also provocative: H.E.S.S., for Hensel European Security Service. Rudolf Hess, one of Adolf Hitler\u2019s deputies, remains a revered figure among right-wing extremists. The firm denied any connection to extremist groups. But Amazon fired the security firm, nonetheless. \u201cWe are unhappy at what we saw,\u201d Dave Clark, Amazon\u2019s vice president of worldwide operations, said by telephone from Seattle on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to become world class in managing the accommodations of those folks versus delegating to a third party. That is a lesson we learned this holiday.\u201d Heiner Reimann, a ver.di official, said that every year after Christmas he is flooded with complaints from temporary workers who say they were falsely led to believe they would get permanent jobs at Amazon if they met tough productivity requirements. He said that the nebulous status of temporary workers at Amazon is a year-round issue, but especially so right after the holiday, when large numbers of temps are let go. But Mr. Clark countered that virtually all of Amazon\u2019s permanent employees in Germany started out as temporary workers.

It was less stressful than driving a taxi, he said. Mr. Fehling, the mayor, frames things in business terms. \u201cIf you want a comfortable job, Amazon is definitely not for you,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon is a performance-oriented company. Amazon is successful because people want those products and they want those prices.\u201d There is no sign yet that the controversy stirred by the documentary is cooling. Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, leader of the Social Democrats, the largest party challenging Ms. Merkel\u2019s governing coalition, has recorded a  video message   in support of the  online petition drive   calling on Amazon to negotiate with the union. \u201cA strong company like Amazon doesn\u2019t need to use poor working conditions to create a competitive advantage,\u201d Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck says in the video. He promises that, if elected, he will tighten rules governing temporary workers. But Mr. Clark of Amazon said a union contract would not allow the company to pursue what it considers an innovative compensation system, which includes stock bonuses for all workers. Amazon\u2019s policy of neither confronting nor engaging with the union was evident on Thursday, when the small group of ver.di organizers, including Mr. Reimann and Mr. Sauer with his Jeff Bezos prop, gathered outside the gates to one of Amazon\u2019s distribution centers on a hillside outside Bad Hersfeld. They had come to present 37,000 signatures gathered online. The activists were far outnumbered by reporters and camera crews, drawn by the prospect of a telegenic confrontation with management. But Amazon, it soon became clear, had decided to defuse the moment. Mr. Reimann pressed a buzzer next to the security gate. When a voice over the intercom asked who was calling, he demanded to be admitted to deliver the signatures. Unexpectedly, the gate opened, and Mr. Reimann and the other ver.di activists tramped across an enclosed metal bridge, trailed by journalists.

        "content": " BAD HERSFELD, GERMANY -- Manuel Sauer, a union activist, stood in front of Amazon's colossal gray distribution center here last Thursday, masquerading as the company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, by holding up a cardboard cutout of a scowling Mr. Bezos. Television crews crowded in for the money shot. Then Mr. Sauer and several other activists unfurled a banner demanding in a curious mix of German and English that Amazon, the American online retailing juggernaut, negotiate a union wage contract with its currently nonunion work force here. ''Make Tarif Vertrag,'' it said in fluorescent letters. Then the organizers marched toward the gates of the Amazon complex to deliver the results of an online petition drive supporting the union's demands. That brief bit of guerrilla theater was the latest skirmish in an escalating battle between ver.di, one of the largest unions in Germany, and Amazon, which employs 8,000 permanent workers at eight distribution centers in the country, one of the online retailer's largest markets outside the United States. Deservedly or not, Amazon's labor relations have lately come under intense scrutiny by German media. The triggering event was a Feb. 12 broadcast by one of Germany's two main public television networks of a documentary about the treatment of some of the 10,000 temporary workers that Amazon hired last year to cope with the holiday rush. Many of those workers were bused in from countries like Spain or Romania where jobs are scarce. Aired on ARD, a publicly financed broadcaster considered left of center, the documentary even implied that Amazon used neo-Nazi thugs to keep workers in line. It showed a team of security workers hired by an Amazon subcontractor roughing up a camera crew outside the temporary workers' quarters. The broadcast has since inspired countless headlines, preoccupied pundits on Germany's ubiquitous television talk shows and may even become an issue in national elections this autumn in which left-leaning Social Democrats will be challenging the government coalition led by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats. The continuing furor raises the question of whether Amazon will be the latest big American company to run afoul of German labor laws, which provide much broader worker rights than in the United States. Walmart abandoned Germany in 2006 following an array of setbacks that included a legal struggle with ver.di, which represents two million workers in service industries including retailing, hotels, food service and public transportation. The name is an abbreviation of Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft, or United Service Industries Union. General Motor's Opel unit, represented by the IG Metall union in Germany, has struggled for more than a decade to cut costs and stem losses in the face of strong worker resistance. Last week, Opel finally struck a truce with its employees that will allow it to close a factory in Bochum, Germany, in 2016 -- but only after promising not to impose involuntary layoffs. Now it seems to be Amazon's turn to serve as a symbol for everything that many Germans resent about American-style management and so-called Anglo-Saxon capitalism. As an American company that has helped drive at least one German competitor out of business and makes heavy use of temporary workers, Amazon is a ripe target. More flexible job regulations, introduced since 2005, have contributed to a plunge in unemployment. Germany's 5.3 percent jobless rate is less than half the euro zone's overall rate of 11.9 percent. But the changes are perceived by many Germans as creating a class of poorly paid workers with few protections. Amazon's work force more than doubles every Christmas season when it hires an additional 10,000 temporary employees, many of them foreigners. Amazon, which already pays above the union rate, has refused to negotiate with the ver.di union on wages or any other issue. But so far Amazon seems to be doing a better job than Walmart did in German public relations. Some of the security agents in the documentary who manhandled a camera crew wore clothing fashionable among neo-Nazis. The name of the security firm, as the film made clear, was also provocative: H.E.S.S., for Hensel European Security Service. Rudolf Hess, one of Adolf Hitler's deputies, remains a revered figure among right-wing extremists. The firm denied any connection to extremist groups. But Amazon fired the security firm, nonetheless. ''We are unhappy at what we saw,'' Dave Clark, Amazon's vice president of worldwide operations, said by telephone from Seattle on Saturday. ''We've got to become world class in managing the accommodations of those folks versus delegating to a third party. That is a lesson we learned this holiday.'' Heiner Reimann, a ver.di official, said that every year after Christmas he is flooded with complaints from temporary workers who say they were falsely led to believe they would get permanent jobs at Amazon if they met tough productivity requirements. He said that the nebulous status of temporary workers at Amazon is a year-round issue, but especially so right after the holiday, when large numbers of temps are let go. But Mr. Clark countered that virtually all of Amazon's permanent employees in Germany started out as temporary workers. He said Amazon was not importing the foreign workers portrayed in the television documentary because they were inexpensive, but because the company could not find enough people locally. Unemployment in Bad Hersfeld and the surrounding area is about 5 percent. ''If we had the ability to staff with local people we would have done it,'' he said. The company has expanded rapidly in Germany in recent years, generating $8.7 billion in the country last year as it provided Germans with a consumer cornucopia of everything from books and MP3 players to vacuum cleaners and kayaks.

        "content": " Target and Best Buy have made it pretty clear they are fighting back against the phenomenon of showrooming, in which customers browse for television sets and other products in stores and then buy them online from Amazon and other etailers for less. Both companies recently made their seasonal practices of matching prices at online retailers a year-round policy. A new study of Amazon customers who research products in stores by Placed, a mobile analytics company, offers some insight into who else could be at the greatest risk of losing business to showrooming. The study relies on Placed's panel of more than 14,000 mobile phone users who consent to have their locations tracked in exchange for store gift cards and other perks. Placed can tell when those people visit a particular retailer without them having to proactively report their store visits. Mobile phones are an indispensable tool of showroomers for comparing prices. Amazon has even given users of its mobile shopping app the ability to simplify price lookups on its site by letting them scan product bar codes using their smartphone cameras. Among the people on its panel who reported buying items on Amazon after looking at the same item in physical stores, Placed found that Bed Bath and Beyond, PetSmart and Toys 'R' Us were the retailers that Amazon showroomers visited the most, with Amazon showroomers 27 percent, 25 percent and 21 percent more likely to visit the three stores, respectively, than the average consumer. When Placed examined Amazon showroomers by gender, it found Best Buy, the Home Depot and Lowe's were the three retailers men were most likely to visit, while Kohl's, PetSmart and Bed Bath and Beyond held the top spots for women. Jon Sandler, a spokesman for Best Buy, said ''showrooming is now dead to us'' because of the company's recent decision to make matching of prices at online retailers permanent. Another interesting nugget in Placed's study shows how much overlap there is between Amazon's Prime customers, who get free two-day shipping and other benefits for an annual fee, and other membership-based retailers. People who told Placed that they were Amazon Prime customers were 45 percent more likely to visit Costco and 39 percent more likely to visit BJ's Wholesale Club than the average shopper. It's possible that at some point those shoppers might choose to ditch their memberships at physical stores as Amazon offers more goods and delivery service that more directly compete with the instant gratification and selection of its offline competitors. For now, though, a lot of people seem to be choosing Amazon Prime without sacrificing other store memberships.",

        "content": " Three independent, brick-and-mortar bookstores have filed a lawsuit against Amazon and the big six publishers, claiming that they are violating antitrust laws by collaborating to keep small sellers out of the e-book market. In a lawsuit filed on Friday in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Book House of Stuyvesant Plaza and Posman Books, both based in New York, and Fiction Addiction, based in South Carolina, alleged that they and other small bookstores were being deliberately forced out of the digital market as a result of agreements between the big publishers and Amazon. \"The contracts entered into between Amazon and the Big Six,\" the complaint said, constitute \"a series of contracts and/or combinations among and between the defendants which unreasonably restrain trade and commerce in the market of e-books sold within the United States.\" At the heart of the lawsuit is the idea that the top publishers signed secret contracts with Amazon that allowed them to code their e-books in such a way that the books could only be read on an Amazon Kindle device or a device with a Kindle app. The booksellers are pushing for open-source coding that would allow readers to buy e-books from any source and download them on any device. They argue that the proprietary coding compels consumers who own Kindles or tablets with Kindle apps to buy e-books only from Amazon. The lawsuit states that the publishers have no similar contracts with independent booksellers. It also notes that Apple once used similar exclusive coding, known as DRM, in the music business, but that after a series of legal challenges, all music available on iTunes was made DRM-free. The booksellers are seeking an immediate injunction to the practice, as well as damages. The six publishers named were Random House, Penguin, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Simon & Schuster and Hachette. The plaintiffs said their claim was a class action on behalf of other independent booksellers as well. A spokesman for Random House, Stuart Applebaum, declined to comment. Amazon said it would not comment on ongoing litigation. The other publishers did not immediately return phone calls.

        "content": " BERLIN -- The workers came from across Europe to pack boxes for the online retailer Amazon at distribution centers in Germany during the Christmas rush. They did not expect to be watched over -- some say intimidated -- by thugs in neo-Nazi-style clothing and jackboots. On Friday, Amazon said it was investigating claims made in a documentary that a subcontractor employed security guards with neo-Nazi ties to oversee the immigrant workers. The documentary, broadcast Wednesday on the ARD public television network, showed guards in black uniforms with H.E.S.S., after Hensel European Security Services, but also the last name of Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess, emblazoned on their chests. According to the film, security guards employed by the subcontractor scared and intimidated hundreds of temporary workers from Hungary, Poland, Spain and other European countries. The accusations ignited an outcry on social media and calls for consumers to think twice about placing their next order on Amazon. The company responded by pledging to investigate the claims, saying that it was in its own interest to provide a safe and secure working environment for all of its employees, temporary as well as permanent. ''Amazon does not tolerate discrimination or intimidation, and we will act swiftly to eliminate any such behavior,'' Ulrike St\u00f6cker, a spokeswoman for the company in Germany, said in a statement.

        "name": "New Hubs Arise to Serve 'Just in Case' Distribution ",
        "content": " Major storms like Hurricane Sandy and other unexpected events have prompted some companies to modify the popular just-in-time style of doing business, in which only small amounts of inventory are kept on hand, to fashion what is known as just-in-case management. The shift has led retailers and logistics companies to alter supply chains by adding distribution hubs, according to the CoStar Group, a real estate research firm in Washington. In turn, the hubs are creating real estate opportunities in markets on and off established distribution paths, including growth in markets outside the traditional seaport hubs on the East and West Coasts. Just-in-case planning helps retailers keep merchandise on store shelves in the event a supply chain disruption affects one of the major distribution markets. Hurricane Sandy affected the ports of New York and New Jersey, for example, and the 2002 lockout of International Longshore and Warehouse Union workers from West Coast seaports delayed the unloading of container ships for months. Just-in-case is a response to the vulnerability of just-in-time supply chains, said Rene Circ, CoStar's director of industrial research. Since the 1990s, just-in-time has made sense for many companies looking to reduce the cost of keeping large inventories on hand. Technology enabled retailers and manufacturers to closely track and ship items to replace merchandise sold or components consumed in production. This model also reduced transportation costs, because goods would be shipped only as necessary. By combining the just-in-case with just-in-time strategy, Mr. Circ said, companies are trying to strike a balance between ''carrying the minimum inventory possible, yet never running out of things, because inventory equals cost.'' For example, Ranger Steel, a company based in Houston that describes itself as the largest privately owned steel plate distributor in the nation, recently expanded its network of distribution centers. Until the late 1990s, Ranger Steel regularly trucked its heavy steel plates directly from a distribution center at the Port of Houston to customers throughout the United States. ''For a long time that concept worked like a charm,'' said Jochen Seeba, the company's vice president and chief operating officer. ''Then you started to see the spike in fuel pricing, and new governmental rules and regulations on insurance coverage for truck drivers that made truck transportation very expensive.'' Like many retailers and wholesale suppliers, Ranger Steel in recent years has added distribution centers to its network, cutting delivery times by moving its inventory closer to customers. Today, suppliers ship steel in bulk to Ranger Steel's seven distribution centers around the country. From there, drivers can deliver orders to most of the company's customers in 24 hours, leveling the playing field with local competitors in markets like St. Louis, where the firm opened a distribution center last year. Reduced transportation cost is a secondary benefit, Mr. Seeba said. The more significant advantage is the ability to serve and retain customers better in an increasingly competitive marketplace, in which a three-day delivery time to St. Louis from Houston is no longer acceptable. ''You have to adjust your model,'' Mr. Seeba said, ''and that's what we have done.'' With just-in-time management, smaller on-site inventories put companies at greater risk of running out of merchandise in the event of a disruption. Shaw Lupton, CoStar's senior real estate economist, said companies were trying to mitigate that risk by diversifying supply chains into multiple distribution centers. As evidence, he pointed to a long-term shift of cargo flows from West Coast to East Coast seaports, and a slowdown of the rate at which the largest warehouse markets have captured market share over the past decade. Some researchers say that retailers, in particular, are under competitive pressure to establish distribution centers near major population centers. Many states have begun to require online retailers to pay sales tax, making it difficult to compete with brick-and-mortar stores on price. In an effort to gain an advantage, online retailers are increasingly offering rapid shipping from nearby distribution centers, Mr. Circ said. ''It's driving this reconfiguration of supply chains and the building of these large warehouses, not just in a few key markets as it used to be, but a lot more widely spread'' across the country, he said. The closer to the customer that a company can transport its goods in bulk, the greater the efficiency and cost savings, said Tim Feemster, senior managing director at the Dallas branch of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, a real estate company. Multiple, well-placed distribution centers minimize the time and distance spent on the final leg of delivery, when trucks are often nearly empty while transporting individual items. ''The final mile is the most expensive cost per pound or cost per piece,'' he said. Retailers sometimes avoid that final-mile delivery by inviting online shoppers to pick up their purchases from nearby stores, Mr. Feemster said. In those cases, the store functions as a distribution center. The tendency toward numerous distribution facilities runs contrary to a strategy that was common just after the recession, when some companies sought efficiency by consolidating warehouse operations, according to Bob Martie, executive vice president for the New Jersey region at Colliers International, a real estate service provider. ''As competition is growing, companies are seeing the need to have better customer service,'' Mr. Martie said. ''Five years ago, one might need two distribution centers to effectively manage the country; now that number seems to be five to seven.'' Or more, for the largest online retailers. On Jan. 30, for example, Amazon.com announced plans to open three fulfillment centers in Texas, each measuring more than one million square feet. In 2012, the company introduced the development of fulfillment centers in Dupont, Wash., and in Middletown, Del., and made a half-dozen similar announcements the previous year. The redesign of supply chains has introduced some new distribution paths. The Hillwood Development Company, based in Fort Worth, will develop two of Amazon's fulfillment centers in Texas, including one at AllianceTexas, Hillwood's 17,000-acre master-planned community north of Fort Worth that is a nexus of rail service, airfreight and highway access. The second will be near Dallas, in Coppell; USAA Real Estate Company is developing the third center just northeast of San Antonio. Plenty of companies need to establish and maintain distribution centers in smaller markets, too, according to Benjamin Butcher, chief executive of STAG Industrial in Boston. STAG owns and manages more than 29 million square feet of single-tenant industrial properties in 31 states. Mr. Butcher said that companies were generally reluctant to make major adjustments to an established supply chain. ''In the tenants we're dealing with, there is a lot of stability,'' he said. ''They don't tend to move unless there is a fairly strong and valid business reason to do it.''

        "name": "A CBS Deal Bolsters Amazon's Challenge to Netflix Deal Bolsters Amazon's Challenge to ",
        "content": " Slowly but confidently, Amazon is building a library of television shows and movies to rival that of Netflix, much to the satisfaction of media companies like Time Warner and CBS, whose executives love to see the competition. Although Amazon will not unveil its own original television shows until the fall at the earliest, it is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to have the exclusive Web rights to shows it can brag about on its Amazon Prime streaming service, like \"Downton Abbey,\" from PBS, and \"Falling Skies,\" from TNT. The latest example came on Monday, when Amazon announced an unusual arrangement with CBS, the country's most-watched television network, to carry episodes of \"Under the Dome\" just days after the series makes its debut on TV in June. \"This deal is yet another sign that the streaming marketplace is becoming more and more robust,\" said Scott Koondel, the chief content licensing officer for CBS, a position that was created two months ago. \"Advances in user-friendly technology from companies like Amazon and Netflix are a boon for premium content owners.\" Amazon has a long way to go to rival Netflix in terms of TV and movie selection. But in some corners of the media business, it is already perceived to be Pepsi to Netflix's Coke. And many other companies - among them Google, Sony, Intel and a new joint venture between Redbox and Verizon - are trying to come up with a Red Bull or a Snapple they can call their own. While Netflix has won attention for unveiling a high quality show, \"House of Cards,\" on its streaming service, \"it is increasingly hard to ignore the progress Amazon has made in a relatively short amount of time,\" Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research, wrote two weeks ago. He predicted that Amazon would quietly spend more than $500 million on video this year. Amazon declined to comment on that figure. Its nearly two-year-old streaming service, called Prime Instant Video, is bundled as part of its $79 annual Amazon Prime membership, which also provides two-day free shipping and a monthly Kindle e-book rental. The company says it has millions of Amazon Prime subscribers, but it will not disclose the precise number. Netflix has about 27 million streaming subscribers in the United States. Instant Video started simply enough about two years ago, with relatively cheap acquisitions of older television shows from networks like CBS and nonexclusive rights to older films from studios like Universal. But Amazon's recent deals have revealed the company's ambitions. When Netflix dropped the rights to some cable series like \"Pawn Stars\" last fall, Amazon swooped in and started streaming them. When Time Warner wanted to sell streams of some of its cable dramas, Amazon bought the exclusive rights to \"The Closer\" and \"Falling Skies,\" while Netflix bought \"Dallas.\" \"This emerging back end for cable originals is a very promising sign,\" Jeffrey L. Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, told investors last week, \"since it should result in production values for cable originals getting even better over time.\" Perhaps its biggest deal yet came last week, when it clinched the rights to past and future seasons of the PBS hit \"Downton Abbey.\" By July, \"Downton\" will be gone from Netflix. Both streaming services mine the data of their users to determine what kinds of shows to license, and what not to. The first two seasons of \"Downton\" were the \"most-streamed TV show on Prime Instant Video,\" said Brad Beale, who oversees video acquisitions for Amazon, so it was a \"pretty easy decision\" to bid for seasons three and four (and five, if it is produced). \"Data is a great proxy for what our customers love,\" Mr. Beale added in a telephone interview. \"We're blessed to have a platform that gives us a lot of insight into what our customers love.\" \"Under the Dome\" - based on the Stephen King novel and produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television - will be unique because each episode will go onto Amazon four days after its premiere on TV. CBS stands to make more money this way than it now does by streaming shows on CBS.com and attaching ads. Analysts expect to see more such deals as broadcasters move away from the free online model made popular by Hulu. Hulu has a subscription component as well, but it has not announced any notable licensing deals the way Netflix and Amazon have done. Its owners are at odds over the future of the service, and its founding chief executive, Jason Kilar, will leave later this winter. Netflix says it expects to compete with Amazon the way HBO and Showtime compete - with TV dramas and comedies of their own. \"When it comes to competition, we not only have a superior content offering due to our larger budget, but we are further along the experience curve,\" Netflix told investors last month. In other words, Amazon is cheap, off-brand Cola. While Netflix has four more original series on tap this year, Amazon is trying out test episodes of six comedies and five children's series. This year, Amazon will stream them and, after hearing from viewers, decide which ones will become series. Roy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, said the pilot process will ensure quality, just as it does for traditional television networks, and make viewers and producers pay attention to Amazon's video projects. \"All that matters is being great,\" he said. \"There's no great benefit in being good; people don't change their habits for good.\" This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. Amazon raised the ante last week when it won the rights to past and future seasons of the PBS hit ''Downton Abbey.'' By July, the series will be gone from Netflix.

Other companies, including Google, Sony, Intel and a new venture by Redbox and Verizon, are scrambling for a Snapple or Red Bull. Watching cat videos online has become a euphemism for wasting time, even if one is not actually watching popular Web felines like  Maru   or  Henri . Advertisers have turned to the genre to sell Litter Genie, a cat-waste receptacle that neutralizes odors,  Andrew Adam Newman reports . The  third in a series of irreverent music videos   promoting the brand has been released on YouTube (the  first two videos   have over  1 million views   apiece.) A gray tabby named Walter is featured in all three videos and a television spot for Litter Genie. The plot of the television show \" Made in Japan \" echoes the very real economic angst of that nation,  Hiroko   Tabuchi explains . The three-part series, broadcast on NHK, focuses on Takumi Electronics, a fictional company whose lead in television and mobile phones has been eclipsed by more nimble upstarts in China and South Korea. So Takumi Electronics turned to manufacturing more efficient lithium-ion batteries, like the actual company GS Yuasa, which made the batteries that have grounded  Boeing's Dreamliner . The show ends with Takumi Electronics teaming up with a Chinese competitor to build safer batteries. The issues with the Dreamliner have yet to be resolved. ABC won the rights to the first on-camera interview with Amanda Knox, an American college student who was convicted of murdering her housemate in Italy while studying abroad in 2009; the conviction was overturned in 2011. The interview will be conducted by Diane Sawyer, the anchor of ABC's \"World News,\" and will air during prime time on April 30,  Brian Stelter writes . Ms. Knox's case attracted a great deal of news coverage because of lurid sexual details attached to the case coupled with her appearance as an attractive girl next door. The interview will coincide with the release of Ms. Knox's book, \"Waiting to be Heard,\" published by HarperCollins. Univision and ABC News are both backing a new channel called Fusion that will target English-speaking Latinos in the United States,  Amy Chozick reports . The channel will premiere this summer and will test whether second-generation Latinos want to watch television created specifically for them. But creating a 24-hour cable channel for a relatively narrow audience with many options in English and Spanish is a risky proposition - studies show that English-speaking Latinos tend to watch the same programs as non-Hispanics.",

        "name": "Citing Potential Damages, Macmillan Settles With U.S. on E-Book Pricing ",
        "content": " Macmillan said on Friday that it had agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by the Justice Department over the pricing of e-books, asserting that the potential costs of continuing to fight the action were too high. The agreement means that all five of the major publishing houses named in the suit have settled. The government accused them last spring of colluding with one another to set the price of e-books artificially high. Apple, which is also a defendant, will continue to trial in June, according to the Justice Department. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday. Macmillan is the smallest of the major publishers. In a letter addressed to authors, illustrators and agents, the company's chief executive, John Sargent, said that the risks were too great to go it alone. \"Our company is not large enough to risk a worst-case judgment,\" he said, while emphasizing that Macmillan did not believe it had engaged in collusion. \"A few weeks ago I got an estimate of the maximum possible damage figure,\" Mr. Sargent said. \"I cannot share the breathtaking amount with you, but it was much more than the entire equity of our company.\" In the suit, filed in April, the Justice Department accused five of the six biggest publishers and Apple of conspiring in e-mails and over lavish dinners to set the price of e-books. The publishers had moved from a wholesale pricing model, which let retailers charge what they wanted, to a system that allowed publishers to set their own e-book prices, a model known as agency pricing. The defendants said they had tried to protect themselves from Amazon, which was pricing e-books below their actual cost, including many for $9.99, putting financial pressure on the publishers that they said would drive them out of business. The dispute underscored the extent to which competition from digital retailers like Amazon was transforming the traditional book industry. Three publishing houses, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Hachette, settled with the government immediately. Penguin, Macmillan and Apple decided to fight the charges. But in December, to clear the way for its merger with Random House, Penguin settled, too. Random House was not named in the suit. The terms of the Macmillan settlement, which is subject to court approval, mirror those agreed to by the other publishers. Macmillan will immediately lift restrictions it has imposed on discounting and other promotions by e-book retailers. Reduced prices could be available to consumers as early as next Monday. The company will be prohibited until December 2014 from entering into new agreements with similar restrictions. The publisher must also notify the government in advance about any e-book ventures it plans with other publishers. And for five years, it will be prohibited from agreeing to any kind of so-called most-favored nation clause with any retailer, meaning that no other retailer is allowed to sell e-books for a lower price. Macmillan had been holding firm that it would not settle, and analysts offered varying explanations for the sudden turnabout. James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said potential merger talks might be one motivation. The publishing industry has begun to consolidate to respond to the threat from Amazon, and when Penguin and Random House announced in October that they would merge, it fed speculation that more alliances would follow. \"This was a fight not worth fighting in the first place,\" Dr. McQuivey said of the lawsuit, \"and given the likely nature of merger conversations behind the scenes, that's where you finally decide the litigation is an obstacle to those talks, which are much more important.\" But Mike Shatzkin, founder and chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a publishing consultant, played down the role of a potential merger. \"There have been no rumors and no signs that Macmillan is merging,\" he said. \"I would actually take their statement at face value.\" He said he thought it was more likely that Macmillan realized that its stand on pricing was having no effect on the market. E-book prices have been declining steadily, but not precipitously, since the settlement with the first three publishers went into effect in September. \"Their settling doesn't change the overall market,\" Mr. Shatzkin said, \"and it looks much more that way to them now than when they were originally fighting.\" Judge Approves E-Book Pricing Settlement Between Government and  Publishers Awaiting Merger With Random House, Penguin Settles E-Book  Case Bookish, New Web Site, Provides Information on Books and  Authors HarperCollins Reaches New Agreements With Amazon and Others on E-Book  Prices Justice Dept.

        "content": " Investors decimated Apple last week when it appeared that the world\u2019s mightiest profit machine might be slowing  down just a tad. But they cheered on Tuesday when  Amazon   said its fourth-quarter sales and earnings  fell short   of expectations . Oh, and expect a miserable first quarter, too. Shares in Amazon immediately jumped nearly 10 percent in after-hours trading, about the same amount that Apple fell after releasing its news. What caught the eye of investors was that operating margins as a percent of consolidated sales rose to 3.2 percent, from 2.7 percent a year ago. \u201cThe carrot for Amazon investors is improvements to margin over time,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. Apple, on the other hand, would need to build a cheaper iPhone to keep growing as fast as it has been, which would slice into its margins. For more than a decade, Amazon has teetered between minimal profits and no profits. In 2012, it said Tuesday, it lost money. But Wall Street has always been more about promises than results, and Amazon is always on the verge of converting its overwhelming online presence into buckets of cash. \u201cAs long as the dream is there, the stock is going to go up,\u201d Mr. Munster said. The short-term news Tuesday was not good. Earnings per share fell to 21 cents from 38 cents in the fourth quarter of 2011. Although fourth-quarter revenue went up 22 percent to $21.27 billion, both revenue and earnings did not meet expectations. Analysts had predicted revenue of $22.2 billion and earnings of 27 cents a share. Forget about all that. What mattered was the improvement in margin. Amazon has had plenty of opportunities to raise its margins in the past, but has instead routinely chosen to reward customers with subsidized shipping and higher discounts. In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Tom Szkutak, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, repeated this mantra. \u201cPutting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders,\u201d he said. Investors took some time to buy into this idea. \u201cWall Street gets in a kerfuffle when we lower product prices and invest heavily in the future,\u201d Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged in 2005, at a point when the stock had tumbled 40 percent in less than a year. \u201cSo don\u2019t buy our stock \u2014 instead buy our products and enjoy our investments.\u201d That was bad advice. The stock is up almost 700 percent since then, hitting a record this month. Shares in Amazon fell nearly $16 in regular trading Tuesday, to $260.35. After-hours, shares went up more than $22. Jason Moser, an analyst with the Motley Fool, who owns shares in the retailer, said that \u201cmany investors, myself included, will more than likely watch this story play out for as long as it takes.\u201d Mr. Moser added in an e-mail message that the market was \u201cbetting a lot on what Amazon hasn\u2019t done yet and betting on the fact that it will do it based on what it\u2019s doing now.\u201d He added, \u201cKind of a \u2018build it and they will come\u2019 sort of thing.\u201d Some analysts are still skeptical. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to sell goods at cost the way Amazon does than sell goods at a 40 percent margin like Apple,\u201d said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve trained your customers to buy at cost, it\u2019s difficult to train them away from it.\u201d Still, Mr. Gillis said: \u201cWho\u2019s going to undercut Amazon? They\u2019re only making half a cent on every dollar. Who can run a business at less profit?\u201d Amazon continues to expand. Last year, the retailer announced it was building a million-square-foot warehouse in Patterson, Calif., about 85 miles southeast of San Francisco. Last week, it announced another million-square-foot warehouse barely 30 miles north of Patterson, in Tracy. It obviously has designs on fast (if not quite same-day) shipping to the seven million generally affluent, Internet-using residents of the Bay Area. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to expand our footprint over time and become even closer and closer to customers,\u201d Mr. Szkutak said on the conference call. Many of those shoppers will be buying material that originated not with Amazon but with more than two million third-party sellers. The volume of items sold by these firms during the 2012 holidays was up 40 percent from 2011. Some of these sellers merely used Amazon to digitally display their goods, while others also used the retailer to ship it. Amazon said earlier this month that third-party sellers sold enough Santa hats during the holiday for Santa to wear a new hat every day for the next 127 years, and enough guitar picks to give one to every attendee of Woodstock \u2014 about a half-million. Analysts expect third-party sales to outpace Amazon deals over the next few years. Recently several states, including California, successfully made deals with Amazon to collect sales tax. That had the effect of raising prices on many Amazon items by more than 5 percent. Land-based retailers, which had agitated for years for such a move, thought the tax might finally level the playing field. Their hopes might be misplaced. Any drop in online sales from the collecting of sales tax tends to be temporary, said Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, which helps retailers sell online, including on Amazon.",

        "name": "YouTube Expected to Experiment With Paid Subscriptions for Some Channels ",
        "content": " MIAMI -- YouTube continues to inch toward a paid subscription option for some of the professionally produced channels, employees of the online video Web site said this week. \"It's a good time to start experimenting,\" Jamie Byrne, the director of content strategy for YouTube, said at a television conference here on Monday. Mr. Byrne didn't elaborate on the timing, but  Advertising Age reported on   Tuesday   that paid channels could be introduced as early as April. Mr. Byrne's use of the word \"experiment\" is important. YouTube is primarily an advertising-driven service, and no one expects that to change. But some of the companies that produce popular videos for YouTube would like to try charging a modest monthly fee for access to their channels. Ad Age said the subscription option would be tried first with a small group of channels, \"likely about 25 at the outset.\" There's been talk about YouTube creating a paid subscription option for more than a year, and it has gained momentum as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon have drawn in subscribers for their video offerings. A YouTube spokesman declined to comment on the report about a possible April introduction, but said: \"We have long maintained that different content requires different types of payment models. The important thing is that, regardless of the model, our creators succeed on the platform. There are a lot of our content creators that think they would benefit from subscriptions, so we're looking at that.\" At the conference here, Mr. Byrne suggested two ways YouTube could go about charging for content. Video creators, he said, could have standalone paid channels \"and be accountable for all the content there,\" much like Glenn Beck's subscription service The Blaze. Or, he said, YouTube could create bundles of subscription channels, charge one price for all of them and share the revenue with the channel creators, much like traditional cable and satellite services. He was careful to add, though, \"I wouldn't count the ad model out.\" The interest in paid subscriptions comes as YouTube continues to  invests heavily in original programming.   Last fall its parent, Google, announced a plan to invest $200 million to market the new channels on the service. \"These channels, we think of them as the next wave of potential networks,\" Mr. Byrne said. \"We think it's going great.\" Karmazin Leaves Sirius XM Earlier Than  Expected Streaming and Micropennies: The  Footnotes Digital Notes: Amazon Enters Apple's Phones to Compete on Music  Downloads The Breakfast Meeting: A Digital Kingdom and the Future of  TVs Herding Cats for  Hollywood",

        "content": " When Randall Sullivan published his biography of Michael Jackson in November, he said he thought the singer was innocent of child molesting but he could not be absolutely positive. He said that after surgeries and more surgeries, little was left of Mr. Jackson's nose besides his nostrils. He argued that despite two marriages, Mr. Jackson was probably a virgin when he died. None of this went over well with Mr. Jackson's fans, who voiced their displeasure with attacks on \"Untouchable: The Strange Life and Tragic Death of Michael Jackson\" and its author, a longtime contributor to Rolling Stone. Their primary weapon: one-star reviews on Amazon. Since my article about their campaign appeared in The New York Times on Monday, dozens of people who were apparently outraged by what they saw the fans doing went to Amazon and wrote five-star reviews as a sort of riposte. There are now 142 five-star reviews, up from two dozen a few weeks ago, and 132 one-star reviews, up from about 100. But the battle is merely joined. After the article appeared, Michael Jackson's Rapid Response Team to Media Attacks asked via Twitter that people continue to post comments on Amazon. Many of the newly posted positive reviews have critical comments. The positive reviews are no more believable in their praise than the negative reviews were in their criticism. By this point, the truth about the value of \"Untouchable\" - not to mention the truth about Mr. Jackson's virginity and nose - is buried underneath all these competing claims, which must count as a victory for the book's opponents. As a result, don't be surprised if \"star bombing,\" as it's been called, keeps on happening. Amazon has tried to make reviewers more accountable by adding several tools where people can evaluate reviews. But this incident proved that those tools are open to their own manipulation. Take, for instance, an excerpt from this review: \"Randall Sullivan is fake, my uncle best friend use to work for the Rolling Stones company and known Randy and the jacksons for years, He use people and lie to them to get ahead and he is not born again.\" That is not a review, that is semi-coherent slander. But Amazon, which said it reviewed all the reviews of \"Untouchable,\" did not see anything wrong with it, and 53 Jackson fans voted it a \"helpful\" review, which in theory pushed it to a more prominent position on the page. Apply those votes to dozens of critical reviews and it's relatively simple for a handful of people to create an apparently massive surge of disapproval.",

        "name": "Swarming a Book Online ",
        "content": " Reviews on  Amazon   are becoming attack weapons, intended to sink new books as soon as they are published. In the biggest, most overt and most successful of these campaigns, a group of Michael Jackson fans used  Facebook   and  Twitter   to solicit negative reviews of a new biography of the singer. They bombarded Amazon with dozens of one-star takedowns, succeeded in getting several favorable notices erased and even took credit for Amazon\u2019s briefly removing the book from sale. \u201cBooks used to die by being ignored, but now they can be killed \u2014 and perhaps unjustly killed,\u201d said Trevor Pinch, a Cornell sociologist who has studied Amazon reviews. \u201cIn theory, a very good book could be killed by a group of people for malicious reasons.\u201d In \u201cUntouchable: The Strange Life and Tragic Death of Michael Jackson,\u201d Randall Sullivan writes that Jackson\u2019s overuse of plastic surgery reduced his nose to little more than a pair of nostrils and that he died a virgin despite being married twice. These points in particular seem to infuriate the fans. Outside Amazon, the book had a mixed reception; in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani  called it   \u201cthoroughly dispensable.\u201d So it is difficult to pinpoint how effective the campaign was. Still, the book has been a resounding failure in the marketplace. The fans, who call themselves Michael Jackson\u2019s Rapid Response Team to Media Attacks, say they are exercising their free speech rights to protest a book they feel is exploitative and inaccurate. \u201cSullivan does everything he can to dehumanize, dismantle and destroy, against all objective fact,\u201d a spokesman for the group said. But the book\u2019s publisher, Grove Press, said the Amazon review system was being abused in an organized campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re very reluctant to interfere with the free flow of discourse, but there should be transparency about people\u2019s motivations,\u201d said Morgan Entrekin, president of Grove/Atlantic, Grove\u2019s parent company. Amazon said the fans\u2019 reviews had not violated its guidelines but declined further comment. The retailer, like other sites that depend on customer reviews, has been faced with the problem of so-called sock puppets, those people secretly commissioned by an author to produce favorable notices. In recent months, Amazon has made efforts to remove reviews by those it deemed too close to the author, especially relatives. The issue of attack reviews, though, has received little attention. The historian Orlando Figes was revealed in 2010 to be using Amazon to anonymously vilify his rivals and secretly praise himself. The crime writer R. J. Ellory was exposed for doing the same thing last fall. Attack reviews are hard to police. It is difficult, if not impossible, to detect the difference between an authentic critical review and an author malevolently trying to bring down a colleague, or organized assaults by fans. Amazon\u2019s extensive rules on reviewing offer little guidance on what is permissible in negative reviews and what is not. With \u201cUntouchable,\u201d Grove had hopes for a modest best seller. The book was excerpted in Vanity Fair, and Mr. Sullivan, a longtime contributor to Rolling Stone who lives in Portland, Ore., promoted it on \u201cNightline\u201d and \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d Amazon selected it as one of the best books of November, encouraging readers to \u201ccheck out this train wreck of a life.\u201d The retailer also selected it as one of the 100 best e-books of the year. None of that helped when Mr. Sullivan tried to complain, saying reviews of his book were factually false yet being voted up by the fans so that they dominated the page for \u201cUntouchable.\u201d The bookseller replied with boilerplate. \u201cRest assured, we\u2019ll read each of the reviews and remove any that violate our guidelines,\u201d adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve appreciated your business and hope to have the opportunity to serve you again in the future.\u201d In an interview, Mr. Sullivan asked: \u201cShould people be allowed to make flagrantly false comments about the content of a book or its author? This is suppression of free speech in the name of free speech.\u201d \u201cUntouchable\u201d is 586 pages of text, with 200 pages of notes. Much of it focuses on Jackson\u2019s chaotic last years, including his efforts at comebacks, his struggles to remain solvent, his shocking death in 2009 and the battle over his estate. It is a largely sympathetic portrait. For instance, Mr. Sullivan seeks to refute the popular notion that the singer had troubling relationships with young boys. Jackson was found not guilty of child-molesting in a criminal trial in 2005. Yet even before the book was officially published on Nov. 13, the rapid response team declared, \u201cIt\u2019s time for action!\u201d Within two weeks, the book had  nearly 100 anonymous one-star reviews   that included such comments as: \u201cA disgrace and a disgusting insult to the greatest artist and entertainer the world has ever known.\u201d \u201cThere is not one actual fact in this book.\u201d \u201cSullivan seeks to criticize Michael\u2019s spending habits? It\u2019s none of his business what Michael spent his money on.\u201d \u201cMichael Jackson has dedicated his entire life to helping others. He doesn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d \u201cThe audacity to term Michael Jackson\u2019s life a \u2018train wreck\u2019 is nothing less than evil and uneducated.\u201d For several days in late November, Amazon stopped selling physical copies of the book after buyers said copies were defective, in a development first reported by  The Portland Oregonian . Mr. Entrekin said Amazon was the only sales outlet that had received such complaints. The fans took the credit for removing the book from sale. \u201cBook stopped selling,\u201d one of them noted in a Nov. 26 post on the Facebook page. \u201cMJ fans we have done it again!!! Who\u2019s BAD!!!\u201d About that time, other readers started leaving positive reviews of the book and criticizing the negative reviews, turning the review forum into a full-scale brawl. The fans labeled these reviewers \u201chaters,\u201d saying: \u201cDo not fight with the haters but we need you to focus on the book and leave negative reviews of the book. Rate it with one star. We do not want the book rating to go up.\u201d It also encouraged the fans to report \u201cthe MJ hating trolls\u201d to Amazon for making \u201cinappropriate and personal\u201d attacks against those who left negative reviews. Tom Mesereau, the Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer who became a hero among Jackson fans when he successfully represented the singer in his molesting case, was a major source for Mr. Sullivan. In early December, he made  a YouTube video   calling the attacks on \u201cUntouchable\u201d a \u201cdisgusting, sophisticated, Hollywood-style P.R. campaign.\u201d In reality, the campaign is being run a long way from Hollywood. An administrator for the rapid response team, who identified himself as Steve Pollard, said five people run the Facebook site and Twitter efforts, only three of them in the United States. Going after \u201cUntouchable\u201d was \u201ca moral responsibility,\u201d said Mr. Pollard, a 52-year-old resident of Detroit. He explained, \u201cIf you were to drive by a graveyard and see someone steal a corpse in order to make a profit, you would feel some responsibility to do something.\u201d He said that the response team did not tell fans what to say in their Amazon reviews and that they did not try to have the book removed, despite messages to the contrary on the Facebook page. But he added in an e-mail that some of the favorable reviews of \u201cUntouchable\u201d \u201cwere removed (I think) because they were attacks against fans and not reviews of his book. We reported the attacks of course.\u201d Mr. Pinch, the Cornell researcher, said he got the sense that \u201cAmazon is hoping that all these problems with positive and negative reviews will go away.\u201d He added: \u201cBut as more and more abuses come to light, the overall effect will be a slow undermining of the process. There are so many ways to game the system.\u201d Grove distributed 16,000 copies of \u201cUntouchable.\u201d Nielsen BookScan, which tracks sales in most outlets, counted only 3,000 copies sold. For a time this month, \u201cUntouchable\u201d was being outsold on Amazon by a book on Jackson\u2019s body language, \u201cBehind the Mask.\u201d That book, published by the author, had something going for it that \u201cUntouchable\u201d did not: the endorsement of the fans. \u201cMichael Jackson would be pleased that such an objective book was written about him,\u201d one reviewer wrote on Amazon.",

        "content": " Amazon has stepped up its competition against iTunes with a version of its MP3 store for Apple's iPhones and iPod Touch devices. Long a distant second to Apple in digital music sales, Amazon has been moving aggressively over the last couple of years to attract music fans. It regularly discounts digital versions of hit albums and songs, something that has occasionally  wrought some mischief   on the Billboard charts. And its Cloud Player and Cloud Drive systems, introduced almost two years ago, let its customers back up their songs and stream them to virtually any device. (Apple, Google and others have their own versions of these so-called \"lockers.\") But until now, customers who have iPhones and other portable devices that use Apple's iOS operating system, could not buy Amazon's MP3's from their device. The new, \"optimized\" version of Amazon's store -- not really an app, but an HTML5 page, easily viewable on a portable device -- lets users do that, putting Amazon and its frequent discounts on downloads in direct competition with iTunes. \"Since the launch of the Amazon Cloud Player app for iPhone and iPod touch, a top request from customers has been the ability to buy music from Amazon right from their devices,\" Steve Boom, the vice president of Amazon Music, said in a statement. \"For the first time ever, iOS users have a way do that.\" HTML5 has become a popular way for developers and media companies to circumvent iTunes, which -- in addition to occasionally rejecting apps, as has happened to the embattled music service  Grooveshark   -- takes a 30 percent cut of all in-app revenue for Apple. Pandora to Pay Sony More: Sony's music publishing arm has struck a one-year deal with Pandora Media that will raise by 25 percent the royalty that the popular Internet radio service must pay Sony to use its music. Sony/ATV, a joint venture between Sony and the estate of Michael Jackson, became the world's largest publisher last year when Sony led the $2.2 billion purchase of EMI Music Publishing, and gave Sony/ATV operational   contro l . Performing rights societies like Ascap and BMI usually negotiate rates on behalf of publishers, but at the beginning of this year Sony withdrew its digital rights from these groups, forcing licensees like Pandora to deal with Sony directly. (The rights societies still represent Sony when it comes to radio, television and other kinds of performances.) The deal could lead to higher rates for other publishers. It could also lead to slightly thinner margins for Pandora, which pays more than half its revenue in royalties, although the vast majority of those royalty payments go to record companies and performing artists. The news of Sony/ATV's deal was first reported by The New York Post. Rhapsody Discount: Rhapsody, the subscription streaming service, was introduced more than a decade ago and has about a million users, but lately all the attention has been on Spotify and other newcomers. To stay competitive, Rhapsody's chief executive recently announced expansion plans in Europe, and on Thursday the company said it would offer the streaming service through its integration with MetroPCS phones. Rhapsody is now available for $5 for MetroPCS customers that pay $40 to $60 a month for phone service. A price point of about $10 a month had become standard for most of these on-demand streaming services, but competition has brought out some discount tags. Recently, for example, Sony put its subscription service, Music Unlimited, on sale for  as little as $12 a year .

        "name": "Amazon Drives Seattle Office Market Surge ",
        "content": " If the strength of Seattle\u2019s office market could be chalked up to one company, it would be  Amazon . Last year, the online retailer was responsible for the city\u2019s biggest deal, its largest lease and the purchase of the only large chunk of downtown land to come on the market in decades. Amazon bought its 1.8-million-square-foot headquarters last month from Vulcan Real Estate for $1.16 billion, the biggest office sale nationwide and a bold departure for a company that had been content to rent space until last year. And it\u2019s not done yet. Although Amazon leases or owns 2.7 million square feet of space in Seattle, the online retailer plans to more than double that figure when it breaks ground on three office towers of its own on the northern fringe of downtown this year. Amazon did not return calls seeking comment. Amazon\u2019s flurry of activity has led to rent increases and a drop in office vacancy and has inspired confidence in the market. Other companies, largely led by technology firms, have shaved the vacancy rate to 10.7 percent at the end of last year, from 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Kidder Mathews, a commercial real estate brokerage. The biggest vacancy decrease has been in South Lake Union, an area north of downtown where Amazon\u2019s stake in the neighborhood has drawn other companies looking for large floorplates and new buildings. In the last three years, about half of Seattle\u2019s net absorption, or the amount of space companies leased and occupied, was in South Lake Union, where the vacancy rate fell to 5.4 percent from 9.3 percent, according to CBRE, a commercial real estate brokerage. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of companies that want to be closer to Amazon and that synergy, whether they do business with Amazon or not,\u201d said Jesse Ottele, a senior vice president at CBRE in Seattle. A tighter office market has pushed up rents across the city. The average rent rose to $29.19 a square foot at the end of last year, from $27.80 in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Kidder Mathews. With few large blocks of Class A office space available and little new space expected to reach the market soon, brokers expect rents to go even higher this year. Developers are now talking about building again \u2014 even without a tenant. Eight million square feet of office space are in the works across the city, with more than half planned or under construction in South Lake Union, according to CBRE. Residential developers will also open 5,800 units this year, the most in decades, according to Dupre & Scott Apartment Advisors, a research firm. Vulcan Real Estate is betting more companies will want to move to South Lake Union. Although the developer, which owns 30 percent of the land there, has built more than five million square feet of space in the last decade, it has up to seven million square feet of space left that it can build. This year, Vulcan is breaking ground on two office buildings leased to Amazon and a life-sciences research building. If the City Council raises height limits in the neighborhood this spring, Vulcan may move ahead with plans for two more office buildings and three 24-story residential towers. \u201cWe\u2019re now looking to position ourselves for a recovering economy and teeing up speculative buildings,\u201d said Ada Healey, a vice president at Vulcan Real Estate. \u201cWe want to be in a situation to take advantage of 2013.\u201d Other developers are also moving ahead in anticipation of the height rezoning. After purchasing blocks in South Lake Union in the last year and a half, Touchstone and Skanska, a Swedish development and construction company, submitted permits for three office buildings, for a total of 1.1 million square feet, that would exceed current limits. Company executives said they would consider building without a signed tenant. \u201cSometime around mid-2012, we saw rents for Class A office that justified new construction,\u201d said Lisa Picard, executive vice president of Skanska USA Commercial Development in Seattle. \u201cThe project is ready to start. We\u2019ll look at the supply and demand of the market and decide whether to go.\u201d Seattle appears to be at the top of many investors\u2019 shopping lists. The Urban Land Institute ranked the city as fourth-best in the country for office buildings thanks to its projected job growth of 1.2 percent and its roster of expanding brand-name companies like Starbucks, Nordstrom and Boeing. Real estate investors, who are looking for steady returns, have flocked to Seattle for its stable and growing companies. \u201cThe capital followed the fundamentals,\u201d said Kevin Shannon, CBRE\u2019s vice chairman in  Los Angeles . \u201cSeattle and San Francisco were the two stars in West Coast markets. A couple of years ago, I\u2019m not sure Seattle would be on a core shopping list. We now have a lot of people looking at Seattle.\u201d The city\u2019s investment market cemented its revival last year. The volume of deals skyrocketed 203 percent in 2012 over the previous year, to $5 billion, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research and consulting firm. Among the 14.5 million square feet sold, Amazon\u2019s headquarters space is the largest. The sale of the Russell Investments Center building early last year, though, was perhaps the most significant of the year because it showed the city\u2019s investment market had fully recovered. When the 42-story office tower was put up for sale in late 2011, it attracted 34 buyer tours, an \u201cincredible\u201d number, said Mr. Shannon of CBRE, which handled the sale.

        "content": " If the strength of Seattle's office market could be chalked up to one company, it would be Amazon. Last year, the online retailer was responsible for the city's biggest deal, its largest lease and the purchase of the only large chunk of downtown land to come on the market in decades. Amazon bought its 1.8-million-square-foot headquarters last month from Vulcan Real Estate for $1.16 billion, the biggest office sale nationwide and a bold departure for a company that had been content to rent space until last year. And it's not done yet. Although Amazon leases or owns 2.7 million square feet of space in Seattle, the online retailer plans to more than double that figure when it breaks ground on three office towers of its own on the northern fringe of downtown this year. Amazon did not return calls seeking comment. Amazon's flurry of activity has led to rent increases and a drop in office vacancy and has inspired confidence in the market. Other companies, largely led by technology firms, have shaved the vacancy rate to 10.7 percent at the end of last year, from 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Kidder Mathews, a commercial real estate brokerage. The biggest vacancy decrease has been in South Lake Union, an area north of downtown where Amazon's stake in the neighborhood has drawn other companies looking for large floorplates and new buildings. In the last three years, about half of Seattle's net absorption, or the amount of space companies leased and occupied, was in South Lake Union, where the vacancy rate fell to 5.4 percent from 9.3 percent, according to CBRE, a commercial real estate brokerage. ''We're seeing a lot of companies that want to be closer to Amazon and that synergy, whether they do business with Amazon or not,'' said Jesse Ottele, a senior vice president at CBRE in Seattle. A tighter office market has pushed up rents across the city. The average rent rose to $29.19 a square foot at the end of last year, from $27.80 in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Kidder Mathews. With few large blocks of Class A office space available and little new space expected to reach the market soon, brokers expect rents to go even higher this year. Developers are now talking about building again -- even without a tenant. Eight million square feet of office space are in the works across the city, with more than half planned or under construction in South Lake Union, according to CBRE. Residential developers will also open 5,800 units this year, the most in decades, according to Dupre & Scott Apartment Advisors, a research firm. Vulcan Real Estate is betting more companies will want to move to South Lake Union. Although the developer, which owns 30 percent of the land there, has built more than five million square feet of space in the last decade, it has up to seven million square feet of space left that it can build. This year, Vulcan is breaking ground on two office buildings leased to Amazon and a life-sciences research building. If the City Council raises height limits in the neighborhood this spring, Vulcan may move ahead with plans for two more office buildings and three 24-story residential towers. ''We're now looking to position ourselves for a recovering economy and teeing up speculative buildings,'' said Ada Healey, a vice president at Vulcan Real Estate. ''We want to be in a situation to take advantage of 2013.'' Other developers are also moving ahead in anticipation of the height rezoning. After purchasing blocks in South Lake Union in the last year and a half, Touchstone and Skanska, a Swedish development and construction company, submitted permits for three office buildings, for a total of 1.1 million square feet, that would exceed current limits. Company executives said they would consider building without a signed tenant. ''Sometime around mid-2012, we saw rents for Class A office that justified new construction,'' said Lisa Picard, executive vice president of Skanska USA Commercial Development in Seattle. ''The project is ready to start. We'll look at the supply and demand of the market and decide whether to go.'' Seattle appears to be at the top of many investors' shopping lists. The Urban Land Institute ranked the city as fourth-best in the country for office buildings thanks to its projected job growth of 1.2 percent and its roster of expanding brand-name companies like Starbucks, Nordstrom and Boeing. Real estate investors, who are looking for steady returns, have flocked to Seattle for its stable and growing companies. ''The capital followed the fundamentals,'' said Kevin Shannon, CBRE's vice chairman in Los Angeles. ''Seattle and San Francisco were the two stars in West Coast markets. A couple of years ago, I'm not sure Seattle would be on a core shopping list. We now have a lot of people looking at Seattle.'' The city's investment market cemented its revival last year. The volume of deals skyrocketed 203 percent in 2012 over the previous year, to $5 billion, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research and consulting firm. Among the 14.5 million square feet sold, Amazon's headquarters space is the largest. The sale of the Russell Investments Center building early last year, though, was perhaps the most significant of the year because it showed the city's investment market had fully recovered. When the 42-story office tower was put up for sale in late 2011, it attracted 34 buyer tours, an ''incredible'' number, said Mr. Shannon of CBRE, which handled the sale. It sold last spring for $480 million -- more than four times its purchase price in 2009. After its bid for the Russell building lost, Clarion Partners, an investment management company, looked for other buildings with the same ''blue chip roster'' and reliable rents, which it found at 1201 Third Avenue, the city's second-tallest tower and a former headquarters of the failed Washington Mutual. Clarion advised on a deal to sell the 55-story tower for $548.8 million, the 10th-largest deal in the country last year, to a joint venture of MetLife and an unidentified institutional real estate investor. ''We expect it to continue to have blue chip tenancy and generate good, predictable cash flow,'' said Steve Latimer, a managing director at Clarion Partners. ''We're not expecting spectacular headlines of tripling our money in three years, just steady growth.'' Seattle's brisk sales pace may slow this year since so many office buildings have traded hands and there are few left. ''Were there other first-class properties, we'd be interested,'' said Mr. Latimer, Clarion's Seattle director. ''Seattle is clearly a market that will continue to grow.''

We have, alternately, searched for the Promised Land and the holy grail. Astronomers have searched for life in outer space. The Buddha searched for truth. But search on the Internet has shifted in recent years. Search is now what the Web companies call \"personalized,\" or in Facebook-speak, \"social.\" This new kind of search is designed to make more money for industry by helping them target advertising. The companies say it can be useful for consumers, and it well may be in certain circumstances. It also threatens to narrow our horizons. For Google, personalized search tracks what we search for and write in our e-mail communications, and so seeks to know us so well that its robots can predict what we want to know. As my colleague Claire Cain Miller has  pointed out , search for \"Sonoma wineries\" and Google may show a forgotten but relevant e-mail conversation from your in-box. Its algorithms can mine, in addition to links from around the Web, what your friends on Google+ have said about Sonoma wineries. That doesn't mean you cannot ditch your friends' recommendations of course, nor that you cannot talk to the woman at the wine shop to recommend something to pair with mussels. But it makes serendipity that much more difficult to achieve. It diminishes discovery. Twitter's \"discovery\" tab predicts what you wish to read. Yelp shows you the taquerias and dry cleaners your friends favor - followed by the recommendations of strangers. Amazon.com serves up things you might like to buy \"based on your browsing history.\" Facebook this week  stepped into the search game , as expected. It will deploy the data that we have laid at its doorstep. Ask a question and Facebook's robots will crawl through your friends' posts to ferret out an answer. Theoretically, these answers will shape the music you listen to, the books you read - perhaps one day, which gods you worship. In the era of social search, how luxurious it is to squirrel away in a library and browse the poetry aisles. How thrilling to walk through a city, unknown and undisturbed, and venture into a restaurant to taste something new and odd. Webster's says the word \"search\" came from the Latin word, \"circare,\" to go about. It is defined principally as \"to look into or over carefully or thoroughly in an effort to find out or discover something.\" Facebook Unveils a New Search  Tool Daily Report: Revamping Bing for Search Engine  Supremacy Microsoft and Facebook Align Further With Patent  Deal What We're Reading: What You're  Reading A Search Engine That Relies on Humans",

Amazon's Kindle tablet and Kindle software apps try to keep all your devices in sync so you can always pick up where you left off reading a book, no matter what gadget you happen to be reading it on at the time. While this can be quite useful the first time through a book, if you are reading it again or are prone to jumping around in the text, the syncing feature may have problems holding your place on the phone and other devices. One way to get around this is to use the \"Clear furthest page read\" information Amazon stores for that e-book. To do so, log into your account on the  Manage Your Kindle   page. In the Your Kindle Library section, find the title of the book you are rereading and click the Actions menu button next to it. Select the \"Clear furthest page read\" option and click the button in the box to reset the page tracker.

        "content": " Amazon is turning to an unlikely old friend to step up its competition in digital music: CD's. Almost two years ago Amazon introduced its  Cloud Player , which lets customers back up their digital music files and stream them on any device; Google and Apple soon followed with their versions. On Thursday, Amazon introduced an enhancement to the service called AutoRip, which expands Cloud Player libraries to include everything its customers have bought on CD, stretching back all the way to 1998. That Baha Men album you bought from Amazon 13 years ago, in other words, can now be listened to instantly through a phone or tablet. \"What we're doing with AutoRip is bringing the cloud to physical music, eliminating that distinction,\" said Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president for digital music. Variations on this have existed before, but they have often met with resistance - if not litigation - from music companies. MP3.com, for example, let customers gain access to their music online after a CD was inserted into a computer to verify ownership, but it was sued for copyright infringement and eventually shut down;  AnywhereCD , by the same entrepreneur, Michael Robertson, was introduced in 2005, but again ran into problems with labels. Amazon has gotten around these problems by striking licensing deals with music companies. Catching Up at (Or Around) the Consumer Electronics Show: The annual International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is well known as an opportunity for manufacturers to show off their latest  \"unuseless\"   gadgets, like a tablet that doubles as a  coffee-table surface   and a  fork that warns you   if you're eating too fast. For digital music services - whether they are participating in the conference or not - the show is also an opportunity to update statistics and introduce new features. Here are a few notable announcements this week. Muve Music   , a subscription service connected to Cricket Wireless phones, said it finished 2012 with 1.1 million subscribers. Muve is often left out of discussions of hot tech products, perhaps because it focuses on low-income customers and has a relatively simple interface for downloading songs. But in two years it has attracted at least as many subscribers as Spotify and Rhapsody, whose last reported numbers in the United States were both 1 million. Internet radio services are pushing hard for a place in new cars, often in the dashboard. Pandora said it was available in 85 models of cars, including its latest addition, Chrysler. In all, Pandora is integrated into more than 1,000 devices, including cars, televisions and various other kinds of consumer electronics. Sirius XM Radio said that it ended 2012 with 23.9 million subscribers, up two million for the year, and that it expected to add another 1.4 million in 2013. Sirius's biggest shareholder, Liberty Media, also said it had   received approval   from the Federal Communications Commission to take over the company. Pitchfork, the online bible of alternative music, introduced a service to stream new albums in advance; its name, appropriately enough, is   Pitchfork  Advance . It should compete with NPR Music, whose advance album streams have proved an effective draw for NPR and provided   valuable promotion  for artists and record companies.

        "content": " Operating the world's largest public cloud still leaves you with the problem of \"unknown unknowns.\" The phrase is associated with the then-defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who in 2002  described   the problems of certainty with regards to war. The reality is no less acute for Amazon as it searches for ways to avoid another widespread outage of its public cloud business, Amazon Web Services. \"We ask ourselves the question all the time,\" said Adam Selipsky, vice president at A.W.S. \"There is a list of things you don't know about.\" On Dec. 29, Amazon Web Services  published   a detailed explanation of what went wrong Christmas Eve, when Netflix and many other customers (Amazon won't say how many) had service disruptions. The company also described what it was doing to ensure the problem would not happen again. The short version: An A.W.S. developer inadvertently took out part of the software that makes sure data loads are properly distributed across the computers in a computer center in Virginia. New activity on the site was slowed or failed altogether. Netflix was unable to supply streaming movies. Service was not fully restored for almost 12 hours. What Amazon didn't go into is how much it is trying to figure out what else might go wrong in an increasingly complex system. Part of that effort consists of publishing explanations (this one was notably full of information), and part consists, as in warfare, of lots more scenario planning. A.W.S. tries to figure out how its complex global network of perhaps a half-million servers could break by having one team look at the work of another, by bringing in top engineers from elsewhere in Amazon and, occasionally, by hiring outside experts in performance and security. \"Running I.T. infrastructure in a highly reliable and cost-effective fashion is hard,\" Mr. Selipsky said. \"We're able to put more resources on that than the vast majority of our customers can. That said, there is no substitute for experience.\" There is also a deep technical lesson in the recent outage. Mostly engineers look at code for flaws, but the operational breakdown at A.W.S. on Dec. 24 seems to have been a result of human organizational error, not the software itself. In the future, developers will need specific permission to change the data load balancing equipment. What isn't clear is whether A.W.S. can examine all of its own management practices to see if there are other such decision-making flaws. Mr. Selipsky, understandably, could not say whether everything else was solid, though he did note that Amazon had eight years of experience running and managing big systems for others. To be sure, such breakdowns happen all the time with old-style corporate servers. While they don't have the dramatic effect of an A.W.S. failure, they may collectively represent much more downtime. In a study   commissioned by Amazon, IDC said downtime on A.W.S. was 72 percent less per year than on conventional corporate servers. While the financing of the study makes its conclusions somewhat questionable, its results are in line with similar studies about online e-mail systems compared with in-house products.

        "content": " In the old days, life for small publishers was a hassle. The economics were such that copies got dramatically cheaper when printed in bulk, but then the books had to be stored, which was expensive. Finding an audience was the hardest part; some independent presses took years or even decades to sell out a modest print run. Now books can be efficiently printed in small quantities, like one copy. Amazon, meanwhile, is happy to do the job of fulfilling orders. The stage is set to allow everyone to become his own  Alfred Knopf. James Morrison, a 36-year-old editor and graphic designer in Adelaide, Australia, is an old-fashioned book enthusiast, with around 10,000 books in his personal library. In 2007 he began a blog,  Caustic Cover Critic: One   Man's Endless Ranting About Book Design,   which showcases and evaluates new jackets. Like any inveterate reader, Mr. Morrison would stumble across obscure books practically begging to be reprinted. For instance, he read an account by the historian David S. Reynolds of \"the largest monster in antebellum literature,\" which was \"the kraken depicted in Eugene Batchelder's 'Romance of the Sea-Serpent, or The Ichthyosaurus,' a bizarre narrative poem about a sea serpent that terrorizes the coast of Massachusetts, destroys a huge ship in mid-ocean, repasts on human remains gruesomely with sharks and whales, attends a Harvard commencement (where he has been asked to speak), [and] shocks partygoers by appearing at a Newport ball.\" Mr. Morrison  concluded that   \"the audience for an 1850 book-length Monty Python-style doggerel poem about a socially aspirant sea serpent is probably just me,\" but how could he be sure? The Internet is all about weaving people together with even stranger tastes. The critic has published about a dozen out-of-copyright volumes using  Lulu , which does the printing, and  Amazon , which does the selling and shipping. He dubbed his venture Whisky Priest in homage to Graham Greene, himself an enthusiast of uncommon and unjustly forgotten literary efforts. On the Whisky Priest list are the Batchelder book; a collection by Edith Wharton; \"Artists' Wives,\" Alphonse Daudet's stories about the war between the sexes; and Storm Jameson's \"In the Second Year,\" a prophetic look at fascism. At a moment when predictions of the demise of print are omnipresent, Whisky Priest seemed an indication that the future might be more complex than anticipated. Mr. Morrison answered some questions by email. What follows is an edited extract. Q. Will the ultimate pleasure for lovers of the printed book be your own editions of your favorite out-of-copyright books? A. For me it was a matter of there being books in the public domain that I wanted to read which were either not available as physical books, or were available only in staggeringly ugly and expensive editions. I originally intended to just design a cover I liked and then print a copy for myself to read, but it turned out to be an almost negligible amount of extra effort to make them available for others to buy as well, so I thought I might as well do so. It would be as easy to produce editions of things like \"Moby-Dick\" or \"Pride and Prejudice,\" but there are already hundreds of versions of those, some with fantastic cover designs, so it would be a bit pointless. Q. How easy would it be for others to become a publisher the way you did? A. It's very easy indeed, assuming you have some basic layout or design skills. Even without those you could still do it, though the book would probably not be so appealing. I'd certainly recommend it for people who, unsatisfied with the available editions, wanted a book they enjoyed having around the house. I wouldn't recommend it as a way of making money. I've spent slightly more on proof copies, etc., than I've earned through royalties. Partly this is because I try to set the book prices as low as possible (I make about $1 a book through Amazon, and a little more if someone buys the books direct from Lulu), since they're: a) books usually available free or cheaply in electronic form, and b) Print on Demand books, which are not quite as nice to hold and handle as conventionally published books, so it seems unfair to charge more for them. Q. I was struck by how little capital you needed. A. Lulu and Amazon take a cut of each copy sold but require no up-front listing fees or anything like that. The only money I spend is on ordering proof copies for myself, which is the production cost without anything else added on -- about $8 for one recent title. To make a book available on Amazon, you need to order at least one physical copy yourself, check it, and then let Lulu know it's OK to go ahead and list it. If you just wanted to list on Lulu's own site, you don't even need to do that -- you could upload a thousand different books and make them available for sale via the Lulu site without ever spending a cent (though you'd never know what they looked like as physical books, of course). Q. How have the books done? A. Not vast numbers. The most popular has sold 27 copies. That, a little surprisingly, is A. P. Herbert's \"The Secret Battle\": it's a very good novel by a once-popular and now nearly forgotten English writer, based on his World War I experiences, and about the way the English army would execute its own men for cowardice. Close behind are \"Transfiguration,\" a pair of novellas and some nonfiction by the great Austrian writer and suicide Stefan Zweig, and \"The Dangerous Age,\" a classic feminist Danish novella by Karin Micha\u00celis. But then there are some which have done surprisingly poorly. F. Scott Fitzgerald's play \"The Vegetable,\" the only edition currently in print, has sold only two copies. But then I can't sell that in the U.S., where it's still in copyright, and that's probably where the main market for a parody on Warren Harding's presidency is likely to be found. Thinking over that sentence, maybe it's a surprise I've sold any copies at all. Q. Who sets the prices? A. The pricing is under my control, to a point. Basically, Lulu tells you the absolute minimum you can charge, which covers the production costs and their profit, and then you add to that whatever you want. For example, the Stefan Zweig production cost is $8.10 and then Lulu add a little to that to create the absolute lowest price, which is the lowest I could charge and still make them a little profit (they take 20 percent of any profit on physical books, or 10 percent for ebooks) -- in this case around $9. I sell it for $11.95, from which Amazon then takes a little over $3 (some of this may also go to Lulu or some other third party -- Amazon doesn't disclose that), and I get 69 cents. If someone decided to buy the book from Lulu, which is less likely since they have to pay for postage and so on, I make $3.08 (and Lulu gets 77 cents); however, almost every sale comes via Amazon. But I could set the price at anything above that base cost of $8.10, like $25 or even $250, if I thought anyone was mad enough to pay it, and most of that inflated cost would come to me. Q. How much have you invested in this overall and how much has it brought you? A. I've only earned a few hundred dollars over two years, and have probably spent about $200 to do that, so I'm slightly ahead, but it's no way to make a living. Partly this is my own fault - I have no interest in marketing or networking, so I just publish the books and let them do their thing. Q. Are others doing this? A. To my surprise, I don't know of anyone doing things in quite the same way as I am. Most publishers of Print on Demand classics seem to operate on a different scale: they make thousands of titles available, usually with identical covers and at eye-watering prices, or else they just sell them as ebooks. I suspect it's a matter of poor timing, technologically: the ability to print a whole physical book cheaply but at a decent quality has become available to everyone just at the same time as ebooks have started wreaking havoc with the market. It's a niche thing, I suspect, but I'm happy enough in that niche. Q. I think this is just beginning. I envision a future where we will all have competing Stefan Zweig lines. A. I hope this is the way it pans out.

But when a representative from Shoptiques, an e-commerce site, arrived at her Midtown Manhattan office with the dress only hours after Ms. Wu, 26, had placed her order, ''I was really impressed that it was here,'' she said. This holiday season, same-day shipping has replaced free shipping as the new must-have promotion. It's logistically complicated and money-losing -- and may not even be a service that consumers want or need, analysts say. But retailers from Walmart to small shops like Shoptiques are willing to take the risk. Even the Postal Service has introduced a same-day option for retailers. And the reason is simple: fear of Amazon.com. Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, has hinted that it will expand its same-day shipping service, giving customers the immediate gratification that has been the biggest advantage of brick-and-mortar stores. For small outfits like Shoptiques, it is not an easy proposition. The courier who showed up at Ms. Wu's office was the company's head of boutique operations, who has put aside her regular job this holiday season to make deliveries by hand. Bigger retailers, like Toys ''R'' Us, Macy's and Target, have worked with eBay to deliver items the same day, as have other old-line stores. Google has begun testing a local delivery service with several chains. ''There's lots going on in this space, and it's all driven by Amazon,'' said Tom Allason, founder and chief executive of Shutl, a British same-day delivery service that will expand to the United States next year. ''It's not really being driven by consumers at the moment.'' The same-day delivery idea was a spectacular failure during the dot.com boom. Companies like Kozmo.com and Webvan went under because the services simply cost too much to be profitable. Amazon has offered same-day shipping since 2009, but with limits -- only in big cities near Amazon warehouses on certain items ordered in the morning. The geographical limits exist because Amazon had built warehouses far from major cities to avoid charging sales tax in certain states. But it has now given in on the sales tax fight, and in return, is erecting warehouses near cities like San Francisco, which analysts say is paving the way for faster, more widespread same-day delivery and spurring competitors. ''It's the old idiom, 'time is money,' '' said Lina Shustarovich, an eBay spokeswoman. ''How much time are you saving by not going to the store? People want it now, they want it fast.'' Walmart, which is the nation's biggest retailer but sells just a fraction of what Amazon does online, is testing same-day shipping during the holiday season in five markets. Generally, it gives shoppers a four-hour delivery window and charges $10 for same- or next-day delivery. The idea is ''to give customers convenience, by way of combining our online shopping with the local presence of stores,'' said Amy Lester, a Walmart spokeswoman for global commerce. But, Ms. Lester said, the test is showing that consumers often pick next-day delivery rather than same day. She declined to give a specific figure for same-day orders, but said thousands of same- and next-day orders had been placed. Net-a-Porter, the designer apparel e-commerce site, said its same-day service is quite popular. Its $25 delivery service in the London and New York areas pays for itself, said Alison Loehnis, its managing director. But its clients are accustomed to paying for concierge service, like the customer who ordered clothing to be delivered the same day to her private jet before a vacation. With the eBay Now iPhone app, introduced this year in San Francisco and New York, customers choose items from physical stores and eBay sends a courier to the store to pick it up and drop it off -- at an apartment, office, coffee shop or bar -- for a $5 fee. EBay declined to say whether it loses money on the orders, but analysts who study logistics say it is not profitable. ''The goal with this pilot was never to monetize,'' Ms. Shustarovich said. But in the future, it could make money, she said, for example if retailers pay eBay a fee for bringing them customers. The Postal Service is testing a same-day service in San Francisco that is meant to offset its declining carrier business, a spokesman said. Consumers can order items until 2 p.m. from 1-800-Flowers.com, the first retailer offering the service, and a Postal Service employee will pick up the package and deliver it between 4 and 8 p.m. Smaller companies are trying different approaches. TaskRabbit, which offers \u00e0 la carte personal assistant services, noticed last summer that delivering items from local stores was the most popular task requested. Now, it charges $10 for delivery from local stores, starting in San Francisco. Today's technology -- including mobile phones, social networking and location-based mapping services -- has forever transformed shoppers' expectations, said Johnny Brackett, a TaskRabbit spokesman. ''People have become accustomed to this idea of instant gratification, where you just type something on your phone and the next thing you know, you have what you need,'' he said. Yossi Sheffi, director of the M.I.T. Center for Transportation and Logistics, said he was ''skeptical'' about same-day working well. Efficient, high volume same-day delivery -- with warehouses that use robots and trucks filled with items -- costs $10 an order, he estimated, while one-off deliveries could cost up to $50 each. It's ''outrageously expensive,'' he said. Not to mention complicated. Shoptiques, which sells apparel from offline boutiques, already offered free returns and free shipping over $100, but Olga Vidisheva, its founder and chief executive, decided to offer same-day shipping during the holidays in New York to compete with larger retailers. She could not afford an outside delivery service, though, so on a recent winter day, the task was left to Arianna Simpson, director of boutique operations. Ms. Simpson had spent the morning dashing between downtown boutiques to pick up orders. Now, carrying a large blue Ikea bag full of Shoptiques parcels, she hurried past a costumed Puss in Boots and talked her way past a front-desk attendant in Midtown Manhattan. After two hours, two subway rides and 3.2 miles on foot, Ms. Simpson had successfully delivered four packages. With Manhattan dark and commuters rushing toward the Herald Square subway, Ms. Simpson went back uptown for a pickup, took two trains to Bushwick in Brooklyn for a drop-off and went to SoHo for a final delivery. Despite all that effort, Ms. Vidisheva said, though people appreciate the service, it is not exactly essential. ''Some people would rather get it in the mail,'' she said. ''You say, 'I'll deliver it the same day,' and they say, 'Listen, there's no rush.' '' But Mr. Allason said that would change quickly. ''People don't need immediate delivery today, but they will need it tomorrow, because as soon as you know it's available, you start expecting it and you start demanding it,'' he said. EBay offers a service, with couriers like Jacob Jones, at right above, and Victor Melendez, at left, that delivers items the same day they were ordered. Arianna Simpson, top right, of the online retailer Shoptiques made same-day deliveries herself. More retailers are offering rush delivery despite the difficult and expensive logistics.

        "content": " This holiday season, same-day shipping replaced free shipping as the new must-have promotion for e-commerce companies,  Stephanie Clifford and Claire Cain Miller report   in Friday's New York Times. Same-day shipping is logistically complicated and money-losing - and may not even be a service that consumers want or need, analysts say. But retailers big and small are willing to take the risk. Even the Postal Service has introduced a same-day option for retailers. And the reason is simple: fear of Amazon.com. Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, has hinted that it will expand its same-day shipping service, giving customers the immediate gratification that has been the biggest advantage of brick-and-mortar stores. Big retailers like Toys \"R\" Us, Macy's and Target have worked with eBay to deliver items the same day, as have other old-line stores.

        "content": " CORRECTION APPENDEDFor some on Christmas Eve, ''White Christmas'' was a blackout on Netflix. That's because problems with Amazon's cloud computing service, which provides storage and computing power for all kinds of Web sites and services, caused Netflix to go down for much of the day. In updates on a Web site that reports on the status of its online services, Amazon traced the trouble to Elastic Load Balancing, a part of its service that helps spread heavy traffic among multiple servers to prevent overload. The company gave few details about the problems in its data center in Northern Virginia beyond this. Social networks filled with complaints. Some customers also complained that Amazon's own streaming service, Amazon Prime, was down. Amazon said it had fixed the problem completely by the afternoon of Christmas Day, and Netflix said it had restored its services to most of the affected consumers by late Christmas Eve. But the episode highlighted how consumers are increasingly using ''the cloud.'' As more everyday devices, appliances and even automobiles rely on services connected to the Internet, consumers expect those services to be available at all times. Yet all sorts of disruptions -- harsh weather conditions or an apparent overload -- can knock a service out for hours. In October, problems with the same Amazon data center in Virginia took down Reddit, Foursquare and Heroku. The instance was explained on the status Web site as ''degraded performance'' in some parts of Amazon's storage service. In June, a lightning storm hit the Virginia data center, taking Netflix as well as Pinterest, Instagram and other sites off line for hours. That time, too, customers were offered little insight into what had happened. In April 2011, an Amazon failure took down many smaller sites that had rented cloud storage space from the Internet giant. That time, the companies that were most affected were start-ups that were less likely to pay for so-called redundancies, or backup systems that kick in when a service fails. Netflix was not affected then, and said at the time it was because it had taken advantage of the redundancies that Amazon offers. Netflix has said that it has built several redundancies into its cloud-based system. For instance, it stores its data across multiple ''zones,'' so if there is a failure in one zone, it can retry in another. It says it also spends money on more capacity than it needs, so that if there are large spikes in customer activity, the service is less likely to go down. Joris Evers, a Netflix spokesman, declined to elaborate on why Netflix went down despite these safeguards. He said the company was investigating the cause and would do what it could to prevent the interruption from recurring. ''We are happy that people opening gifts of Netflix or Netflix-capable devices on Christmas morning could watch TV shows and movies and apologize for any inconvenience caused Christmas Eve,'' Mr. Evers said. Tera Randall, an Amazon spokeswoman, said the company has been ''heads down'' to ensure services are running smoothly and that a full summary of the incident would be published in a few days. Amazon is one of the biggest players in online services, hosting data storage and computation for hundreds of companies, including Netflix, Instagram and Pinterest. Once a sideline Amazon set up six years ago, the cloud service has since exploded into a business that is expected to bring in about $1 billion to the company this year. Other companies offer similar services, notably Google, which introduced its competitor in June. Microsoft is also in the business with Windows Azure. Although the service disruptions may annoy some companies and their customers, it's unlikely many businesses will end their partnerships with Amazon in light of this latest Netflix failure, said James McQuivey, an analyst for Forrester Research. He added that it was unlikely that a temporary service failure for Netflix was going to cause many to cancel subscriptions. He said companies can pay extra to Amazon to add safeguards that increase reliability of their online services, but they typically choose to save costs and take the risk of their services going down temporarily. He said that Amazon has been especially popular among businesses because it has been gradually improving its services and lowering its costs. Businesses, ''of course, are going to say, 'Gee, Amazon, what's going on?' '' Mr. McQuivey said. ''But in reality they're all getting such a great deal. I don't see them getting that upset about it.'' For consumers, though, it may be a different matter. On Christmas Eve, Merrilee and Alex Barton were watching an episode of ''It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia'' when their Netflix feed started to stammer and finally froze, then began to buffer excessively. ''It would try to load and get to about 2 to 7 percent of the way through and then just hang there for five minutes,'' Mrs. Barton said. Eventually the two said they gave up and -- with nothing else going on in Farmingdale, N.Y. -- decided to ''nerd it up.'' They played a few games of Minecraft, a video game in which the players can build whatever they wish. In the game, all the technology worked. Correction: December 28, 2012, Friday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about problems with Amazon's cloud computing service referred incorrectly at one point to the company's public comments on the issue. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, Tera Randall, an Amazon spokeswoman, said that the company was working to ensure services were running smoothly and that Amazon would publish a full summary within a few days. It is not the case that Amazon ''did not offer an official statement or explanation.'' The article also misstated the month that problems at an Amazon data center in Virginia took down Reddit, Foursquare and Heroku. That occurred in October, not last month.",

        "content": " Electronic readers aren't all that exciting. They're rectangular, their screens are black and white, and all can't do much more than display text. So how do you liven things up? For starters, Amazon and Barnes & Noble added lighting systems to their newest readers, the Kindle Paperwhite and the Nook Simple Touch, to make it easier for people to read in the dark. In Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite, four LEDs mounted on the bottom of the reader shoot light toward the surface of the display. Barnes & Noble's lighting, called GlowLight, has a similar system with LEDs. Both these glowing e-book readers cost $120. But will adding some lights be enough to prevent e-book readers from becoming an endangered species? The International Data Corporation, a research firm, said shipments of tablets, smartphones and PCs grew 27.1 percent from last year. However, e-book readers are losing momentum. In the United States, manufacturers sold nine million e-book readers this year, down from 15.5 million last year, according to Forrester Research. So why would anyone still want a reader? Readers are still much cheaper than tablets in general; the cheapest Kindle costs $70, while the cheapest Kindle Fire tablet costs $160. And if all you want to do is read books, a dedicated reader is still the best device for the job, said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester analyst. GRAPHIC: Light Reading: The Kindle Paperwhite uses a unique lighting system to illuminate its electronic ink display. Rather than using a backlight as on LCD-based tablets, the Paperwhite uses a transparent light guide that directs light from four edge-mounted LEDs down toward the surface of the display.

        "content": " Right about now, just as millions of e-readers and tablets are being slipped under Christmas trees, there was supposed to be a ferocious price war over e-books. Last spring, the Justice Department sued five major publishers and  Apple   on e-book price-fixing charges. The case was  a major victory   for  Amazon , and afterward there were widespread expectations \u2014 fueled by Amazon \u2014 that the price of e-books would plunge. The most extreme outcome went like this: Digital versions of big books selling for $9.99 or less would give Amazon complete domination over the e-book market. As sales zoomed upward, even greater numbers of consumers would abandon physical books. The major publishers and traditional bookstores were contemplating a future that would pass them by. But doomsday has not arrived, at least not yet. As four of the publishers have entered into settlements with regulators and revised the way they sell e-books, prices have selectively fallen but not as broadly or drastically as anticipated. The $10 floor that publishers fought so hard to maintain for popular new novels is largely intact. Amazon, for instance, is selling Michael Connelly\u2019s new mystery, \u201cThe Black Box,\u201d for $12.74. New best sellers by David Baldacci and James Patterson cost just over $11. One big reason for the lack of fireworks is that the triumph of e-books over their physical brethren is not happening quite as fast as forecast. \u201cThe e-book market isn\u2019t growing at the caffeinated level it was,\u201d said Michael Norris, a Simba Information analyst who follows the publishing industry. \u201cEven retailers like Amazon have to be wondering, how far can we go \u2014 or should we go \u2014 to make our prices lower than the other guys if it\u2019s not helping us with market share?\u201d Adult e-book sales through August were up 34 percent from 2011, an impressive rate of growth if you forget that sales have doubled every year for the last four years. And there have been more recent signs of a market pausing for breath. Macmillan, the only publisher that has not settled with the Justice Department, said last week  as part of a   statement from John Sargent , its chief executive, that \u201cour e-book business has been softer of late, particularly for the last few weeks, even as the number of reading devices continues to grow.\u201d His laconic conclusion: \u201cInteresting.\u201d Mr. Norris said Simba, which regularly surveys e-book buyers, has been noticing what it calls \u201ccommitment to content\u201d issues. \u201cA lot of these e-book consumers aren\u2019t behaving like lab rats at a feeder bar,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cWe have found that at any given time about a third of e-book users haven\u2019t bought a single title in the last 12 months. I have a feeling it is the digital equivalent of the \u2018overloaded night stand\u2019 effect; someone isn\u2019t going to buy any more books until they make a dent in reading the ones they have already acquired.\u201d Another, more counterintuitive possibility is that the 2011 demise of Borders, the second-biggest chain, dealt a surprising blow to the e-book industry. Readers could no longer see what they wanted to go home and order. \u201cThe print industry has been aiding and assisting the e-book industry since the beginning,\u201d Mr. Norris said. It is possible that Amazon, which controls about 60 percent of the e-book market, is merely holding back with price cuts for the right moment. The next few weeks are when e-book sales traditionally take a big jump, as all those newly received devices are loaded up with content. Amazon declined to comment beyond saying, \u201cWe have lowered prices for customers from the prices publishers set on a broad assortment of Kindle books.\u201d Barnes & Noble declined to comment on its pricing strategy. The question of the proper price for e-books has shadowed the industry ever since Amazon introduced the Kindle in late 2007 and created the first truly popular portable reading device. Amazon had a natural impulse to build a market and was an aggressive retailer in any case, so it took best sellers that cost $25 in independent bookstores and sold them for $9.99 as e-books. Consumers liked that. E-book adoption soared. In a typical ebullient forecast, James McQuivey, a Forrester analyst, wrote two years ago that digital book sales would be $2.8 billion by 2015, up from a mere $169 million in 2009. \u201cA very altered publishing world is about to emerge,\u201d his report said. (He said last week that he was not tempering his forecast.) Publishers, however, did not want to see their product sold so cheaply by Amazon, which would accelerate the shift away from the printed books they still depended on. With the help of Apple, they introduced a new system that gave them greater control over prices, which went up. The Justice Department found this to be illegal collusion and in April, sued. After the suit was filed, Amazon said it looked forward to lowering prices. The industry braced itself. The Authors Guild predicted the end of the physical bookstore. \u201cAmazon is committed to capturing the U.S. book market by forcibly moving it online, where it can more easily eliminate its competitors,\u201d  the guild wrote . Paul Aiken, the guild\u2019s executive director, did not return calls for comment last week. As the summer wore on and publishers negotiated with the government, Amazon customers began asking why they did not immediately notice a change. \u201cIt seems to me that the Kindle books have gone up,\u201d D. Amick wrote in a typical comment on an Amazon forum. Some say they never expected a price war at all. \u201cThe pricing war hasn\u2019t happened because Amazon can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Nate Hoffelder of the  Digital Reader , a site devoted to e-book news and opinion. \u201cThe money Amazon lost on e-book discounts in 2008, 2009 was covered, at least in part, by the high price of Kindle hardware,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that the Kindle is being sold so cheap, Amazon no longer has the hardware income to act as a cushion.\u201d This is debatable \u2014 Amazon has always devoted itself to market share rather than profitability \u2014 but it is undeniable that the cost of e-readers has plunged much more than the cost of e-books. When the Kindle made its debut it was a big hit at $399. The cheapest model is now $69. Barnes & Noble is selling its cheapest Nook for $79, discounted from $99. Even as prices fall, though, the dedicated e-reader is losing steam. The market peaked last year, with 23.2 million devices sold, IHS iSuppli said in  a report this month . This year, sales will be 15 million. By 2016, the forecast is for seven million devices \u2014 as opposed to 340 million tablets, which allow for e-reading and so much more. Jordan Selburn, senior principal analyst for consumer platforms at IHS, said the migration from e-readers to tablets puts Amazon in \u201can interesting position\u201d with e-book prices. \u201cAmazon does not make much off the hardware,\u201d he said. \u201cIts goal is to sell you content. When they sell you a Kindle Fire tablet, they are not just selling you books but movies, diapers, garden hose. It\u2019s a portal into their entire store.\u201d But one day, Amazon must try to make a profit. \u201cIn the era of the tablet, the difference between a book and diaper disappears,\u201d the analyst said. Perhaps there will be loss leaders, but more likely each product will have to carry its own weight. In other words, this might be as cheap as e-books will ever be.

After the suit was filed, Amazon said it looked forward to lowering prices. The industry braced itself. The Authors Guild predicted the end of the physical bookstore. ''Amazon is committed to capturing the U.S. book market by forcibly moving it online, where it can more easily eliminate its competitors,'' the guild wrote. Paul Aiken, the guild's executive director, did not return calls for comment last week. As the summer wore on and publishers negotiated with the government, Amazon customers began asking why they did not immediately notice a change. ''It seems to me that the Kindle books have gone up,'' D. Amick wrote in a typical comment on an Amazon forum. Some say they never expected a price war at all. ''The pricing war hasn't happened because Amazon can't afford it,'' said Nate Hoffelder of the Digital Reader, a site devoted to e-book news and opinion. ''The money Amazon lost on e-book discounts in 2008, 2009 was covered, at least in part, by the high price of Kindle hardware,'' he said. ''Now that the Kindle is being sold so cheap, Amazon no longer has the hardware income to act as a cushion.'' This is debatable -- Amazon has always devoted itself to market share rather than profitability -- but it is undeniable that the cost of e-readers has plunged much more than the cost of e-books. When the Kindle made its debut it was a big hit at $399. The cheapest model is now $69. Barnes & Noble is selling its cheapest Nook for $79, discounted from $99. Even as prices fall, though, the dedicated e-reader is losing steam. The market peaked last year, with 23.2 million devices sold, IHS iSuppli said in a report this month. This year, sales will be 15 million. By 2016, the forecast is for seven million devices -- as opposed to 340 million tablets, which allow for e-reading and so much more. Jordan Selburn, senior principal analyst for consumer platforms at IHS, said the migration from e-readers to tablets puts Amazon in ''an interesting position'' with e-book prices. ''Amazon does not make much off the hardware,'' he said. ''Its goal is to sell you content. When they sell you a Kindle Fire tablet, they are not just selling you books but movies, diapers, garden hose. It's a portal into their entire store.'' But one day, Amazon must try to make a profit. ''In the era of the tablet, the difference between a book and diaper disappears,'' the analyst said. Perhaps there will be loss leaders, but more likely each product will have to carry its own weight. In other words, this might be as cheap as e-books will ever be.

        "content": " Movie attendance was up 5.6 percent, despite a weak summer, punctuated by mass killings at a screening in Aurora, Colo., of the latest Batman feature,  Brooks Barnes writes . Ticket revenue at North American theaters is projected to jump by 6 percent, to $10.8 billion, according to an analysis by  Hollywood.com . In 2012, industry executives say, the increase from foreign sales was even more critical, salvaging the prospects of movies that were mild disappointments in the United States like \"Ice Age: Continental Drift,\" from 20th Century Fox, which made $68 million in China alone. This year was a particularly lucrative year for Lions Gate Entertainment, which includes both the Lionsgate and Summit banners, Mr. Barnes writes, which had a pair of blockbusters, \"The Hunger Games\" and \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2.\" As a result, Lions Gate, a small movie company bolstered by its acquisition of Summit Entertainment, will end the year as North America's fifth-largest distributor as measured by ticket sales, surpassing 20th Century Fox and Paramount. A pair of books by the Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly about a pair of presidential assassinations - Lincoln's and Kennedy's - sit atop The New York Times hardcover nonfiction best-seller list. He writes them with a researcher, Martin Dugard,  Leslie Kaufman reports ; Mr. O'Reilly says he does the writing himself, setting a word count for each week. Asked whether 1,000 a day would be a good pace, he replied, \"I can write 1,000 words in my sleep.\" The day after Christmas, he starts on his next book, part of a three-book deal with Henry Holt. He won't say what his next topic is, but on his office wall, next to a newspaper announcing the Kennedy news, is one reporting on William McKinley's assassination at the turn of the last century. Amazon has been cracking down on users' rave reviews of books that appear to be less than objective, according to writers who have noticed that their disappearance,  David Streitfeld reports . Amazon won't discuss the purge - including the basis for eliminating reviews and how many have been eliminated - which only adds to the authors' uncertainty. The move follows a number of highly publicized cases of authors using \"sock puppets,\" or fake online identities, to increase the number of positive reviews of their work. Critics of the rise of sock puppets have also aimed at a retired librarian from Atlanta who has more than 25,000 reviews, almost all of them granting four or five stars. The settlement with the government of e-book pricing that was intended to counteract an anticompetitive agreement between the big publishers and Apple hasn't yet led to more competition,  David Streitfeld reports . Amazon, a critic of the pricing agreement, has largely respected the $10 floor for e-books the publishers were seeking. A reason, analysts say, is that the growth in e-book market share is slowing down. \"Even retailers like Amazon have to be wondering, how far can we go - or should we go - to make our prices lower than the other guys if it's not helping us with market share?\" said Michael Norris, a Simba Information analyst who follows the publishing industry. Midge Turk Richardson, a former Roman Catholic nun who later edited Seventeen magazine, died last weekend at age 82,  Margolit Fox writes . Her life had a neat symmetry - 18 years in a convent in Los Angeles as Sister Agnes Marie, from the ages of 18 to 36, and 18 years as the editor of Seventeen from 1975 to 1993. While a nun, she taught and became a principal of a school in a largely Latino section of the city; after much soul-searching, she asked to be released from her vows, headed to Greenwich Village and began a career in publishing.

        "name": "Giving Mom\u2019s Book Five Stars? Amazon May Cull Your Review ",
        "content": " Giving raves to family members is no longer acceptable. Neither is writers\u2019 reviewing other writers. But showering five stars on a book you admittedly have not read is fine. After several well-publicized cases involving writers buying or manipulating their reviews,  Amazon   is cracking down. Writers say thousands of reviews have been deleted from the shopping site in recent months. Amazon has not said how many reviews it has killed, nor has it offered any public explanation. So its sweeping but hazy purge has generated an uproar about what it means to review in an era when everyone is an author and everyone is a reviewer. Is a review merely a gesture of enthusiasm or should it be held to a higher standard? Should writers be allowed to pass judgment on peers the way they have always done offline or are they competitors whose reviews should be banned? Does a groundswell of raves for a new book mean anything if the author is soliciting the comments? In a debate percolating on blogs and on Amazon itself, quite a few writers take a permissive view on these issues. The mystery novelist J. A. Konrath, for example, does not see anything wrong with an author indulging in chicanery. \u201cCustomer buys book because of fake review = zero harm,\u201d  he wrote on his blog . Some readers differ. An ad hoc group of purists has formed on Amazon to track its most prominent reviewer,  Harriet Klausner , who has over 25,000 reviews. They do not see how she can read so much so fast or why her reviews are overwhelmingly \u2014 and, they say, misleadingly \u2014 exaltations. \u201cEveryone in this group will tell you that we\u2019ve all been duped into buying books based on her reviews,\u201d said Margie Brown, a retired city clerk from Arizona. Once a populist gimmick, the reviews are vital to making sure a new product is not lost in the digital wilderness. Amazon has  refined the reviewing process   over the years, giving customers the opportunity to rate reviews and comment on them. It is layer after layer of possible criticism. \u201cA not-insubstantial chunk of their infrastructure is based on their reviews \u2014 and all of that depends on having reviews customers can trust,\u201d said Edward W. Robertson, a science fiction novelist who has  watched the debate   closely . Nowhere are reviews more crucial than with books, an industry in which Amazon captures nearly a third of every dollar spent. It values reviews more than other online booksellers like Apple or Barnes & Noble, featuring them prominently and using them to help decide which books to acquire for its own imprints by its  relatively   new publishing arm . So writers have naturally been vying to get more, and better, notices. Several mystery writers, including R. J. Ellory, Stephen Leather and John Locke, have recently confessed to various forms of manipulation under the general category of \u201csock puppets,\u201d or online identities used to deceive. That resulted in  a widely circulated   petition   by a loose coalition of writers under the banner, \u201cNo Sock Puppets Here Please,\u201d asking people to \u201cvote for book reviews you can trust.\u201d In explaining its purge of reviews, Amazon  has told some writers   that \u201cwe do not allow reviews on behalf of a person or company with a financial interest in the product or a directly competing product. This includes authors.\u201d But writers say that rule is not applied consistently. In some cases, the ax fell on those with a direct relationship with the author. \u201cMy sister\u2019s and best friend\u2019s reviews were removed from my books,\u201d the author M. E. Franco said  in a blog   comment.   \u201cThey happen to be two of my biggest fans.\u201d Another writer, Valerie X. Armstrong, said her son\u2019s five-star review of her book, \u201cThe Survival of the Fattest,\u201d was removed. He immediately tried to put it back \u201cand it wouldn\u2019t take,\u201d  she wrote. In other cases, though, the relationship was more tenuous. Michelle Gagnon lost three reviews on her young adult novel \u201cDon\u2019t Turn Around.\u201d She said she did not know two of the reviewers, while the third was a longtime fan of her work. \u201cHow does Amazon know we know each other?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I started to get creeped out.\u201d Mr. Robertson suggested that Amazon applied a broad brush. \u201cI believe they caught a lot of shady reviews, but a lot of innocent ones were erased, too,\u201d he said. He figures the deleted reviews number in the thousands, or perhaps even 10,000. The explosion of reviews for \u201cThe 4-Hour Chef\u201d by Timothy Ferriss shows how the system has evolved from something spontaneous to a means of marketing and promotion. On Nov. 20, publication day, dozens of highly favorable reviews immediately sprouted. Other reviewers  quickly criticized Mr. Ferriss,   accusing him of buying supporters. He laughed off those suggestions. \u201cNot only would I never do that \u2014 it\u2019s unethical \u2014 I simply don\u2019t have to,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail, saying he had sent several hundred review copies to fans and potential fans. \u201cDoes that stack the deck? Perhaps, but why send the book to someone who would hate it? That doesn\u2019t help anyone: not the reader, nor the writer.\u201d As a demonstration of social media\u2019s grip on reviewing, Mr. Ferriss used Twitter and Facebook to ask for a review. \u201cRallying my readers,\u201d he called it. Within an hour, 61 had complied. A few of his early reviews were written by people who admitted they had not read the book but were giving it five stars anyway because, well, they knew it would be terrific. \u201cI am looking forward to reading this,\u201d  wrote a user   posting under the name mhpics. A spokesman for Amazon, which published \u201cThe 4-Hour Chef,\u201d offered this sole comment for this article: \u201cWe do not require people to have experienced the product in order to review.\u201d The dispute over reviews is playing out in the discontent over Mrs. Klausner, an Amazon Hall of Fame reviewer for the last 11 years and undoubtedly one of the most prolific reviewers in literary history. Mrs. Klausner published review No. 28,366, for \u201cA Red Sun Also Rises\u201d by Mark Hodder. Almost immediately, it had nine critical comments. The first accused it of being \u201criddled with errors in grammar, spelling and punctuation.\u201d The rest were no more kind. The  Harriet Klausner Appreciation Society   had struck again. Mrs. Klausner, a 60-year-old retired librarian who lives in Atlanta, has published an average of seven reviews a day for more than a decade. \u201cTo watch her in action is unbelievable,\u201d said her husband, Stanley. \u201cYou see the pages turning.\u201d Mrs. Klausner, who says ailments keep her home and insomnia keeps her up, scoffs at her critics. \u201cYou ever read a Harlequin romance?\u201d she said. \u201cYou can finish it in one hour. I\u2019ve always been a speed reader.\u201d She has a message for her naysayers: \u201cGet a life. Read a book.\u201d More than 99.9 percent of Mrs. Klausner\u2019s reviews are four or five stars. \u201cIf I can make it past the first 50 pages, that means I like it, and so I review it,\u201d she said. But even Stanley said, \u201cShe\u2019s soft, I won\u2019t deny that.\u201d The campaign against Mrs. Klausner has pushed down her reviewer ratings, which in theory makes her less influential. But when everything is subject to review, the battle is never-ending. Ragan Buckley, an aspiring novelist active in the campaign against Mrs. Klausner under the name \u201cSneaky Burrito,\u201d is a little weary. \u201cThere are so many fake reviews that I\u2019m often better off just walking into a physical store and picking an item off the shelf at random,\u201d she said.",

        "content": " Nearly three years after the first iPad was introduced, the tablet has come a long way. Now there are plenty of smaller, cheaper tablets that are pretty powerful. So why buy a more primitive e-book reader? That appears to be what a lot of people are thinking this year. The research firm the International Data Corporation found a surge in shipments this year of what it called \"smart connected devices,\" including tablets, smartphones and PCs. That market grew 27.1 percent from last year, to 303.6 million shipments, according to IDC. Meanwhile, e-book readers are losing momentum. This year, worldwide shipments of e-book readers will fall to 14.9 million units from 23.2 million units last year - a 36 percent drop, according to estimates by IHS iSuppli. The research firm eMarketer noted these trends in a   report published on Thursday . Forrester Research is seeing a similar trend. In the United States, manufacturers sold nine million e-book readers this year, down from 15.5 million last year, according to Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester analyst. Next year, the number of e-book readers sold will be 7.5 million units, and in 2014 that number will drop to 5.3 million and keep falling from there, Forrester predicts. Does it make much sense anymore to buy e-book readers? They are still far cheaper than tablets - the cheapest Kindle costs $70, while the cheapest Kindle Fire tablet costs $160. But many people are choosing to pay extra to get the features of a tablet, Ms. Rotman Epps said. In a survey conducted by Forrester, 12 percent of respondents said they had bought a tablet instead of an e-book reader, and 39 percent of tablet owners said they wouldn't buy an e-book reader in the future. \"It's looking like e-readers were a device for a particular moment in time that, more rapidly than we or anyone else thought, has been replaced by a new technology,\" Ms. Rotman Epps said in an interview. That doesn't mean Amazon and Barnes & Noble, which have been big sellers of e-book readers, need to worry. Those companies have been offering touch-screen tablets for a while now. The companies that will be most vulnerable to this trend are those that primarily make e-book readers, like Kobo, Ms. Rotman Epps said.

        "content": " Sirius XM Radio has appointed James E. Meyer as its interim chief executive officer, the company announced on Wednesday, as Mel Karmazin steps down from the top spot earlier than expected. Mr. Meyer, who has been Sirius's president of operations and sales since 2004, will serve as its chief while the company, which is in the midst of a takeover by Liberty Media, searches for a permanent replacement. Mr. Meyer, who will also join Sirius's board, will receive a base salary of $1.3 million. He will also be eligible for bonuses if another chief executive is named before his contract runs out in October, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Karmazin took over Sirius in 2004, and in October  announced   that he would leave on Feb. 1. But the filing said that on Tuesday he had resigned as chief executive and also left the board. Liberty, which began the year with 40 percent ownership of Sirius, has spent much of the year buying up shares on the open market to take over the company. Liberty's chief executive, Gregory B. Maffei, who is also on Sirius's board, is leading a search committee, and has said that it was considering candidates from inside and outside the company. Google and the Cloud Wars: Google has lobbed the latest volley over access to music collections through the cloud -- a fancy name for the Internet, basically -- by introducing a free scan and match feature on its Play service in the United States. Last year, Amazon, Google and Apple rushed to introduce so-called cloud (or locker) systems, which let people store music files on distant servers for streaming or downloading to various devices. Apple led the pack with iTunes Match, which for $25 a year matches a user's songs to those in a master database, thus bypassing the often cumbersome process of uploading each file. (To do that you need special licenses from music companies, which Google and Amazon at first did not have.) Amazon added scan-and-match in  July , and this fall Google caught up too , first in Europe and then yesterday in the United States. But Google's version has one advantage: it is free. Apple still charges $25 a year, with a maximum of 25,000 songs; Amazon offers to back up 250 tracks free and then charges $25 a year for up to 250,000 songs (not counting ones bought on Amazon). Google's limit is 20,000 tracks. Whether the feature catches on with consumers is another question. Google Play, introduced only a year ago, has been slow to gain traction as a music store, and  somecommentators   used Google's announcement on Wednesday to voice their doubts about whether customers care about backing up song files when streaming music has become ubiquitous through services like Spotify and even Google's YouTube.

        "content": " 10:53 a.m. | Updated Penguin, trying to ensure a clean slate before its planned merger with Random House, announced on Tuesday that it was settling a lawsuit brought by the Justice Department over the pricing of e-books. In a statement, the company said, \"Penguin has always maintained, and continues to maintain, that it has done nothing wrong and has no case to answer.\" Nevertheless, the company said, it was agreeing to settle because of the impending merger of Random House, a division of the German media company Bertelsmann, and Penguin, a division of the English conglomerate Pearson. That deal, in which Bertelsmann will assume 53 percent control of the new company, was announced in October. The publishing industry is beginning to consolidate to try to better meet the online challenge from Amazon. The company wrote in its statement, \"It is also in everyone's interests that the proposed Penguin Random House company should begin life with a clean sheet of paper.\" The Justice Department said in a statement that it was reviewing \"the proposed joint venture announced by Penguin and Random House Inc., the largest U.S. book publisher. Should the proposed joint venture proceed to consummation, the terms of Penguin's settlement will apply to it.\" In April, the Justice Department  filed a lawsuit   accusing five major publishing houses and Apple of conspiring to fix the price of e-books. These five had moved from a wholesale pricing model that allowed retailers to charge what they wanted to a system that allowed publishers to begin setting their own e-book prices, a model known as \"agency pricing.\" The publishers had looked for a way to prevent Amazon from pricing books below their actual cost, which they said would hurt the industry over time. But the government said the publishers conspired in e-mails, in telephone conversations and at lavish dinners to keep e-book prices artificially high. Three big publishing houses - HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Hachette - settled with the Justice Department, but Penguin, Macmillan and Apple decided to fight the charges, until Penguin reversed course on Tuesday. The department said it would continue to press its case against Apple and Macmillan. In the terms of a settlement that a judge approved in September,  the three publishers that settled agreed   to end contracts with Apple and with e-book retailers that contained restrictions on their ability to set prices, and agreed not to make such restrictive contracts for the next two years. Terms of Penguin's settlement were not announced, but people with knowledge of the details said that they were essentially the same as those received by the other three publishers. In May, when Penguin  filed its response   in United States District Court in New York, it said that Amazon treated books as \"widgets.\" It described Amazon as \"predatory\" and \"monopolist,\" and said that the government's case was based on \"innuendo.\" Penguin said that it still believed that agency pricing was legitimate. \"Penguin continues to believe that the agency pricing model has encouraged competition among distributors of both eBooks and eBook readers and, in the company's view, continues to operate in the interest of consumers and author,\" the company said in its statement.

        "name": "In Europe, Publishers Dealt a Setback Over e-Book Pricing ",
        "content": " BERLIN \u2014 The  European Commission   settled its antitrust case against  Apple   and four book publishing groups over e-book price fixing on Thursday, in what was described as a victory for the leading online seller,  Amazon , and a setback for publishers fighting for the ability to set prices for electronic literature in the digital marketplace. The European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, said he was ending his office\u2019s investigation after Apple and the publishers \u2014 Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins, Hachette, and Holtzbrinck, the owner of Macmillan \u2014 agreed to end their attempt to set prices for e-books through a series of preferred selling agreements. Under those agreements, made in 2010, publishers could set their own prices on e-books, with the retailer acting as an agent taking a commission. Apple championed this agency model. For print books, by contrast, publishers act as wholesalers, charging retailers about half the cover price for a book and then allowing retailers to set their own price to consumers. Amazon built a huge business by offering consumers discounts under this wholesale model. Publishers fear that under the wholesale model, Amazon can sell e-books for less than it pays, taking a loss in the short term to drive smaller competitors out of business, thus gaining a monopoly, to the detriment of the publishers. European Union officials, however, see things differently: that collusion by publishers would lead to higher prices for consumers. \u201cObviously, the coordination of commercial behavior between competitors \u2014 here, with the help of Apple \u2014 is forbidden by our competition rules,\u201d Mr. Almunia said in Brussels in a statement. \u201cWhatever the publishers\u2019 initial concerns about retail prices, dealing with this situation through collusion is not acceptable.\u201d Under terms of the settlement, Apple and the publishers agreed to immediately end their preferred agency agreements, the legal pacts that contained \u201cmost favored customer\u201d clauses effectively blocking sales to price discounters. Apple and the publishers, Mr. Almunia said, tried to make the agreements standard in the industry. Amazon and other online retailers that refused to agree to the group\u2019s pricing terms, Mr. Almunia said, \u201cwere told they might not be supplied with e-books if they did not agree to the switch.\u201d \u201cRetailers had little option but to surrender their discretion in setting retail prices if they wanted to avoid a serious disruption of their business,\u201d he said. The decision by Mr. Almunia, a Spanish jurist who has set a pattern of compromise since becoming Europe\u2019s top antitrust officer in February 2010, followed a similar resolution in the United States. In September, a federal judge approved the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s settlement with HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Hachette. Mr. Almunia had opened the European investigation in December 2010. He had signaled recently that a compromise was in the works, and the announcement on Thursday was seen as no surprise by European competition lawyers. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bellis, a lawyer in Brussels who represented Microsoft in its own multiyear European antitrust case, said Mr. Almunia\u2019s settlement in the e-book case reflected his preference for fast, inexpensive solutions to corporate attempts to abuse market dominance. \u201cThis is something indeed that was expected,\u201d Mr. Bellis said. \u201cI am seeing more and more that the commission is resorting to settlements. This is a more practical approach than fines and lengthy prosecutions.\u201d Apple benefits from the resolution because it will not have to pay a fine, Mr. Bellis said. The regulator\u2019s decision will not help the fragile situation of many publishers, said Fran\u00e7oise Dubruille, director of the European and International Booksellers Federation, a Brussels group representing the 27 E.U. national bookselling organizations, which in turn have many small and medium-size publishers, in addition to large groups, as members. Ms. Dubruille said the settlement would effectively further Amazon\u2019s ability to set the purchase price of e-books in Europe, which would not help a struggling publishing industry. \u201cWe aren\u2019t happy about this,\u201d Ms. Dubruille said of the decision. \u201cWe think the big players in this industry have disproportionate power and influence in the digital market. We want to see fair competition. This might look like a victory for consumers, but in the long run, this is bad news, because the pressures on prices will increase.\u201d",

        "name": "Coffee Break ",
        "content": " LONDON - A slim young man in a green wool jacket sipped from his tall red cup of coffee and watched the protest. He had just left the Starbucks opposite London's Angel underground station, having squeezed past around 50 protesters accusing the coffee chain of tax evasion, hypocrisy and hating women. In the circumstances, his insistence on standing in front of them and finishing off his Starbucks cup of coffee was rather brave. I asked if he was making some kind of anti-anti-capitalism statement. \"I'm actually doing the P.R. for Starbucks,\" he said. \"Oh, do you want to give me an interview?\" \"Definitely not,\" he replied with a grimace, turned his back and walked away. I have no way of knowing if he was really doing P.R. or simply had a peculiar sense of humor, but much of the Starbucks P.R. team must share his distaste for talking to British journalists right now, given the scale of the challenge they face. After  an investigation by Reuters published in October   revealed the chain had paid no corporate tax in Britain for 14 of the last 15 years, it has become a target for protesters angered by the British government's austerity program, and for politicians demanding an end to tax avoidance. Starbucks U.K. paid another Starbucks subsidiary in The Netherlands royalties for the right to the company brand, and paid a third subsidiary in Switzerland for buying coffee. That meant Starbucks as a whole could book its income in the lower-tax Dutch and Swiss jurisdictions and show no taxable income in Britain at all. Starbucks insists that its financial arrangements are entirely legal, and the tax authorities have never questioned them, but many of its customers are still appalled. Over the past three years, economic growth here has been almost nonexistent, the government has cut spending on almost everything, yet Starbucks sold close to $1.9 billion worth of coffee and food, and paid less tax on its income than one of its baristas. The appearance of unfairness has touched a nerve. Amid a growing customer boycott, Starbucks agreed last week to pay $32 million in taxes over the next two years . \"While Starbucks has complied with all U.K. tax laws, today we are announcing changes that will result in the company paying higher corporation tax in the U.K. Specifically, Starbucks will not claim tax deductions for royalties and standard intercompany charges,\" wrote Kris Engskov, Starbucks' managing director for Britain, in an open letter on the company Web site. This concession had the suspicious air of a marketing exercise (one missive posted on Twitter said  \"too little to   latte\" ), and it failed to calm the storm.  UK Uncut , the activist group behind Saturday's protest, kept the pressure on by linking Starbucks's low tax-payments to government cuts in services for women. As protesters arrived at the Islington branch in the minutes before noon, Sarah Walker of the  English Collective of   Prostitutes   (who wore a sign saying \"Cuts force women into prostitution\") handed out banners and leaflets. David Martin, 27, in thick-framed glasses and brogues, who had taken the bus from Hackney, had a look through. \"Lesbian mums?\" she asked, holding one out. \"That's probably not me,\" he replied, instead taking a leaflet linking rising unemployment to rising domestic violence and hanging it round his neck. Starbucks is just one of several targets for the anti-tax-avoidance campaigners.  Members of Parliament grilled   executives   from Google (which paid nearly $9.6 million of corporate tax on turnover in Britain of nearly $638 million in 2011) and Amazon (which paid nearly $2.9 million of corporate tax on nearly $5.4 billion of sales in 2011) over their tax arrangements as well. Margaret Hodge, of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, said the companies' activities were  \"outrageous   and an insult to British businesses and individuals who pay their fair share\" . The two Internet giants have shown no sign that they will change course, so Martin gave me some tips on how to boycott them without complicating Christmas shopping. \"I've been getting everything on Google, rather than Amazon,\" he said. \"And I've got ad-blocker on my computer so I'm destroying Google's business model and bringing them down from within.\" The protest wound down after an hour, and I walked along Upper Street to find somewhere to have a (non-Starbucks) cup of coffee and to warm up. I sat and drank my Americano and took note that I was reading a kindle and sporadically looking up information via Google on my Android phone. I'm happy to join a boycott of Starbucks, since I seem to be one of the few people on the planet who has never bought a cup of coffee there. But I doubt I'm the only Briton who would struggle to unwind the tentacles the Internet giants have thrust into my life.

        "content": " When Amazon.com introduced its first tablet last year, one of the harshest reviews came from Jakob Nielsen, the usability expert. He slammed the Kindle Fire for offering \"a disappointingly poor\" experience. ''If I were given to conspiracy theories, I'd say that Amazon deliberately designed a poor Web browsing user experience to keep Fire users from shopping on competing sites,'' Mr. Nielsen told Bits. His blunt comments sparked their own conspiracy theories: that he was somehow doing Apple's bidding by criticizing a cheaper competitor of the iPad. But then, just about everyone who didn't like the Fire last year was accused by the more extreme Fire fans of being an Apple cultist. Mr. Nielsen, principal of the Nielsen Norman Group, a Silicon Valley consulting firm, predicted that the retailer would get just \"one more shot\" at establishing itself in the tablet marketplace. \"If that's a failure,\" he added, \"then the Fire is doomed to the dust pile of history.'' As the second generation of Fires - 9-inch and 7-inch devices - seem to likely to pile up under Christmas trees shortly, we asked Mr. Nielsen what he thought. If Amazon is going to collapse in a heap of busted dreams, we want to be on the inside track. Mr. Nielsen kindly agreed to check the devices out. When he did, he was pleasantly surprised. There was much that needed to be improved in the earlier model, and it was. \"Last year's Fire was like a Ford Model T,\" he said. \"You had to start out by hand-cranking it forever, and it was still prone to breaking down. Now it's a Model A from the 1930s - a real car. You can drive it places.\" Some things he particularly liked: --- The e-mail reader. \"It is a very well-designed piece of software that took me only seconds to set up. It's better than the iPad e-mail reader in small ways.\" -- Less glare. \"Last year, if you turned the Fire off, it was almost like looking into a mirror. This year, there's some reflection but not as much.\" -- Just about everything else. \"It's more pleasant for a lot of uses - Web browsing, using applications, watching movies. The hardware has improved a good deal. The pixel density is better, so the text is clearer and easier to read.\" Some things he didn't like: -- There is no ability to enlarge the text in the Web browser. \"If you're trying to squeeze in Web pages, the text tends to get small. How serious a problem this is depends on how good your eyesight is.\" -- The app selection. Apple has an edge with developers of several years and several hundred thousand apps. -- The 9-inch Fire might have a bigger screen, but it isn't optimized to take advantage of it by showing more information, such as more items in a table of contents, or more paragraphs in an article. Mr. Nielsen's bottom line: \"If you want a small device, for financial reasons or because you want to carry it in your purse, the smaller Fire is better than the iPad Mini. The 10-inch iPad is probably better than 9-inch Fire, but not by a lot.\" The masses do not appear to be quite as enthusiastic as Mr. Nielsen. The 7-inch Fire, for instance, has 368 one-star reviews on Amazon, about 10 percent of the total. Nearly a third of all the reviews are three stars or less. That is about what the original, much criticized Fire got after the first month.",

        "content": " LONDON - An attempt by Starbucks to buy its way out of a consumer boycott with a voluntary payoff to the British taxman may have backfired. The Seattle-based global coffee chain  has offered to pay the British government \u00a320 million , or $32 million, over the next two years after it emerged that the company had paid only \u00a38.6 million since 1998 on sales of \u00a33 billion in Britain. But politicians, newspapers and coffee-drinkers called the offer a public relations stunt that made a joke of the tax system. Richard Murphy, a British accountant, posted: Note to Starbucks: we don't want token gestures.

Taxpayers queuing up to try Starbucks 'pay what you think it fair' tax model  bit.ly/Urjolh News Thump (@newsthump)   December 7,  2012 A tax pressure group said it  planned to go ahead with sit-ins   at 40 of the company's stores this weekend. With Britain and other European states in the grip of an austerity regime stemming from the debt crisis, taxes are replacing sex as the daily staple of the popular press amid a backlash against corporations and individuals accused of not paying their fair share. Rendezvous  reported on Wednesday   on international moves to squeeze the owners of bank accounts in Switzerland who are accused of using the country's banking secrecy laws to squirrel away fortunes in unpaid taxes. Across Europe,  governments have launched a crackdown   on Internet giants, including Google and Amazon, by moving to close loopholes that allow them to pay minimal tax on their operations in the Continent. No one is accusing the multinationals of breaking the law. The accusation is that they are  taking advantage of   clever tax avoidance methods   to minimize their contributions to European treasuries. The Associated Press wrote this week: \"Thanks to the way the European Union is run, companies operating in Europe can base themselves in any of the 27 member countries, allowing them to take advantage of a particular country's low tax rates.\" Business lobbyists have argued that a populist campaign against alleged multinational tax avoiders is anti-business. Others have argued that the way forward is for  politicians to reform tax law at the European level . Kris Engskov, who heads Starbuck's British unit,  acknowledged on Thursday   that \"tax has become an important subject of debate over the past several weeks and I think it's important to share that the emotion of the issue has taken us a bit by surprise.\" He said the company would pay around \u00a310 million annually in tax over the next two years, whether its British operation, which includes 760 retail stores, was profitable or not. Executives of Starbucks, Google and Amazon last month faced a fierce grilling on taxes by British legislators. After the session of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee,  one observer wrote : \"By the end, Starbucks management had been plucked, roasted, ground and sprayed with hot steam.\" The committee this week accused the companies of \"immorally\" avoiding paying their fair share of taxes. Margaret Hodge, the opposition Labour Party politician who chairs the committee, said, \"Global companies with huge operations in the U.K. generating significant amounts of income are getting away with paying little or no corporation tax here.\" As the tax issue became the favorite talking point among customers and baristas, Starbucks opted to offer its voluntary payment under threat of a consumer boycott. Political reaction was cautious at best. Ms. Hodge said it was a \"first step in the right direction\" and she hoped Google and Amazon would follow suit. Stephen Williams, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, part of the coalition running the government,  was quoted saying , \"It is extraordinary. People have been joking that some of these multinationals seem to think that paying tax is voluntary. Well, Starbucks have just confirmed the joke really.\" Prem Sikka, a professor of accountancy at Essex University, was among those who rejected the concept of a \"private sweetheart deal\" with the taxman,  telling the BBC : \"We need to get Starbucks to pay proper tax.\" The company's \u00a320 million, or $32 million, offer put it on  a potential collision course with investors , according to The Financial Times, since the payment would come from its parent group. \"Its plan is yet to be accepted by the U.K. tax authorities, which were not consulted in advance,\" the business daily reported, \"and it sends a troubling signal to other companies under attack over their U.K. taxes, including Amazon and Google.\" Storm in a Coffee Cup Over Corporate Tax  Loopholes Self-Interest Leads to Collapse of BAE-EADS  Merger Will Europe Ever Get Its  Supergrid?

        "name": "Intel's Schooling From the 'Big Four' Cloud Customers ",
        "content": " Intel prides itself on having some of the smartest engineers around. When it comes to the world's largest computing systems, however, the chip giant now takes a back seat to a certain kind of powerful new customer. How giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon work with Intel could mean a lot for much of the rest of the technology industry. Their needs on things like computing power and energy consumption get a lot of attention from Intel, which expects many other companies to eventually build big systems of their own. Diane Bryant, who runs Intel's data center group, would not identify Intel's Big Four, other than to say they were all American companies. It is most likely she meant Google, which leads in search; Facebook, the dominant social media company; Amazon, which has the biggest cloud rental business; and Microsoft, which uses the cloud for search and media services, as well as corporate computing. Put together, they represent a diverse array of needs, calling for different technology approaches. \"The Big Four operate at a very different beat rate, and they are very tech savvy, so they don't want a lot of input,\" said Ms. Bryant. \"They all get a dedicated salesperson, the same as the others in our Top 40 customers, but there is a lot more direct innovation from them, and a lot of sharing of ideas.\" Chinese companies like Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba, she said, were building their own clouds quickly, she said. As costs drop, even more service providers are likely to join. Ms. Bryant's Big Four have become active centers of innovation, product testing, and future engineering choices for some of Intel's most critical semiconductors. A server chip introduced to the general public last March, she noted, was first installed in three of the Big Four the preceding September because the customers were willing to sacrifice possible production kinks in order to have the latest chip. \"It was a new thing for us,\" she said. In exchange, they provide Intel with a lot of early information about how the chip is performing. The information is particularly useful as Intel strives to make its data center business recover some of the loss suffered in the collapse of the personal computer market. In the first nine months of 2012, Intel's PC client group had revenue of $25.8 billion, a drop of 2.25 percentage points from the first three quarters of the previous year. The data center business pulled in $7.9 billion, an increase of 6.7 percent. Ms. Bryant has told her bosses that she'll double annual revenue, to $20 billion, by 2016. The intense relationship with Intel is not the only way that the cloud giants seek to influence the computer markets. Facebook builds its own computers, then  challenges   companies like Hewlett-Packard and Dell to meet or exceed its performance specifications. A chip announcement from Intel next Tuesday will feature executives from both Facebook and H.P. Not all the cloud providers are so forthright at sharing information, as data on things like power utilization can yield competitive information to competitors. Google is known to have developed its own semiconductors, for example, but declines to patent the product. The methods cited in the patent might give too many clues about what Google is doing next.

        "name": "U.K. to pursue firms that avoid tax ",
        "content": " The British government on Monday announced plans to crack down on tax dodgers, as a parliamentary report criticized American companies for what it described as tax avoidance. George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said he had earmarked an additional \u00a377 million, or $124 million, for a campaign against \u2018\u2018offshore evasion and avoidance by wealthy individuals and multinationals.\u2019\u2019 The push, the Treasury said in a statement, was expected to yield \u00a32 billion in additional annual revenue. The drive comes amid growing criticism in Britain and elsewhere in Europe of the fiscal policies of several American companies that pay little tax on the billions of pounds and euros in sales that they generate in the region. \u2018\u2018Global companies with huge operations in the U.K., generating significant amounts of income, are getting away with paying little or no corporation tax here,\u2019\u2019 said Margaret Hodge, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament, in a report published Monday. \u2018\u2018This is outrageous and an insult to British businesses and individuals who pay their fair share.\u2019\u2019 The report focused on the tax practices of Starbucks, Amazon and Google, criticizing their policy of using lower-tax jurisdictions within Europe, like Ireland, Luxembourg and Switzerland, to record much of the revenue they generate in higher-tax countries like Britain, France and Germany. Companies like Google then transfer money they earn in Europe to Bermuda or other locations, thereby deferring or avoiding U.S. taxes as well. At parliamentary hearings last month, executives of Google, Amazon and Starbucks maintained that their tax policies were perfectly legal, because European Union law lets companies based in one member state operate across the 27-country bloc. But tax investigators in several countries, including France, are looking into whether the practice, which is also employed by European companies, is legal. Amazon recently disclosed that it had received a bill from the French fiscal authorities for $252 million in back taxes, adding that it was contesting the claim. Starbucks said Monday that it was reviewing its British tax practices, after the company disclosed recently that it had paid no corporate tax in Britain last year, despite generating \u00a3398 million in sales. \u2018\u2018To maintain and further build public trust we need to do more,\u2019\u2019 Starbucks said in a statement. \u2018\u2018The company has been in discussions with H.M.R.C. for some time\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a reference to Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue & Customs, the British tax collection agency \u2014 \u2018\u2018and is also in talks with the Treasury.\u2019\u2019 Google declined to comment Monday but has previously insisted that its tax practices comply with British law. Amazon did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The British parliamentary report stopped short of accusing the companies of tax fraud but said their explanations had been \u2018\u2018unconvincing and, in some cases, evasive.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The inescapable conclusion is that multinationals are using structures and exploiting current tax legislation to move offshore profits that are clearly generated from economic activity in the U.K.,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Hodge said. The committee also criticized Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue & Customs, saying it had been \u2018\u2018too lenient.\u2019\u2019 The government said it would hire experts to investigate \u2018\u2018transfer pricing arrangements,\u2019\u2019 which multinational companies use to reduce their tax liability in higher-tax jurisdictions. \u2018\u2018The Government is clear that while most taxpayers are doing their bit to help us balance the books, it is unacceptable for a minority to avoid paying their fair share, sometimes by breaking the law,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Osborne said in a statement.",

        "name": "On Amazon, Cooking Up Friendly Reviews ",
        "content": " Beneath the placid surface of Amazon, authors and reviewers have been in a ferment this fall. After several well-publicizedepisodes   involving writers soliciting or paying for reviews, the retailer seems to be cracking down on log-rolling. Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of book reviews  have been killed . Amazon has not explained exactly why. One possible target: authors who have sent gift certificates to reviewers to buy their books. While it's easy to see the potential for abuse here -- \"Here's a $100 gift certificate. Buy a copy of my novel for 99 cents and keep the change\" -- some writers argue it is no different than sending a physical copy of a book to someone, which is what publishers do in the offline world and therefore is allowed by Amazon. At least, the line between the two is blurry. Consider the case of Tim Ferriss, the self-help specialist whose extensive promotional activities help power his books onto the best-seller lists. He  gave away a thousand advance copies   -- many more than most authors -- before \"The 4-Hour Body\" was published two years ago. Some went to friends, some to companies where Mr. Ferriss had been a guest speaker, still more to those who helped or volunteered to help with the book. On publication day, all the recipients were sent an e-mail marked urgent asking them to spend 30 seconds writing a review. Many complied. But some readers saw something suspicious. \"Although this generated a fair amount of backlash from skeptics, it was an immense boon for us to have a solid foundation of 200 positive reviews in the first week,\" a Ferriss marketing associate  wrote in a guest post   on the author's blog in March 2011. \"Having a solid Amazon rating gives the book an enormous amount of social proof that can last for years, and (although immeasurable from our end) boosts the conversion rate on the sales page substantially.\" Two weeks ago, Mr. Ferriss brought out his third book, \"The 4-Hour Chef.\" Published this time by Amazon itself, the nearly 700-page tome came equipped with many five-star reviews posted on the date of publication. Only a few of the reviewers said they had gotten advance copies. Once again, some readers saw something suspicious. \"Tons of fake ratings have been posted on the first day that this book came out,\"  posted a reader   who goes by carmex. \"Please do not encourage this type of behavior.\" A debate  sprang up   about whether it was permissible to solicit advance reviews from friends and others you strongly suspected were going to give you a rave. \"Would you consider those reviews as being within the spirit and integrity of what a review should be or is that more akin to network marketing?\" asked one reader, who put himself in the second group. Mr. Ferriss said in an e-mail message that he sent out from 200 to 300 advance copies of \"The 4-Hour Chef\" to \"people I identified as being potentially interested in my book and who would probably enjoy the content. Does that stack the deck? Perhaps, but why send the book to someone who would hate it? That doesn't help anyone: not the reader, nor the writer. \" Some critics noted that some of Mr. Ferriss' fans had written no other reviews -- usually a tip-off that the reviewer has been paid or was a friend of the author. \"No conspiracy required,\" Mr. Ferriss said. \"How many people routinely leave Amazon reviews? Very few. Even reading as much as I do, I very rarely leave book reviews. But if a writer I loved, one who'd written more than 400 blog posts for free (as I have) -- posts I benefited from -- asked me to do so as a 30-second favor, would I be inclined? Absolutely. That would make me a new reviewer.\" The most controversial of Mr. Ferriss' reviewers are not reviewers at all. These are fans who straightforwardly admit they haven't read the book, but nevertheless give it four or five stars: \"It baffles me how excited I am to have this book in my hands -- Just arrived home and it was sitting on my porch waiting for me,\"  wrote one \"reviewer.\"   \"Just ordered this hope it's as good as the other titles,\"  said a second . \"I'll write a review once I'm finished,\"  exclaimed a third. Surprisingly, Amazon says it is completely legitimate to do this. \"We do not require people to have experienced the product in order to review,\" Craig Berman, an Amazon spokeman, said. \"Some people write reviews on why they decided not to buy, or write a review as a gift giver rather than the product owner.\" Perhaps, but I see a future where we have virtual enthusiasm for virtual books. Reviews are crucial to online commerce in a way they never were to offline sales. If Amazon can devise a system that is transparent and fair to all involved -- author, reviewer and customer -- it will be a greater achievement than same-day delivery.

        "content": " The day before Thanksgiving, Amazon was offering a discounted price of $49.96 on a popular Xbox game, the same price as Walmart and 3 cents lower than Target. Then the holiday pricing shuffle began. Amazon dropped its price on the game, Dance Central 3, to $24.99 on Thanksgiving Day, matching Best Buy's ''doorbuster'' special, and went to $15 once Walmart stores offered the game at that lower price. Amazon then brought the price up, down, down again, up and up again -- in all, seven price changes in seven days. The unluckiest buyer paid more than triple the price that the luckiest buyer paid. Retail price wars online have entered a new era of speed and precision, creating a confusing landscape for shoppers in which prices leap and plummet on short notice. In the old days, merchants sent employees into competitors' stores to check on pricing, and days later ''sale'' signs reflected new markdowns. Now, sophisticated computer programs accomplish the same goal online within hours, and even minutes. The battle was fierce over the holiday weekend. At the request of The New York Times, the pricing firm Dynamite Data tracked prices at three major online retailers -- Walmart.com, Amazon.com and Target.com -- starting the week before Thanksgiving and going through Tuesday, after most heavy promotions ended. The data shows that retailers paid close attention to competitors' online prices and in-store specials, battling to undercut one another by as little as 2 cents and forcing each other into out-of-stock positions as they pushed prices down. Retailers fight to have the lowest prices to increase sales volume, aid in search-result prominence and help burnish a thrifty reputation. ''There was definitely some gamesmanship going on,'' said Diana Schulz, chief executive of Dynamite Data, which tracks online retail pricing, stock status, ratings and other information for clients like Samsung and Abt Electronics. While Amazon has long tinkered with prices, its competitors are now fighting back. In the last year, Walmart invested heavily in pricing tools, a Walmart eCommerce spokesman, Dan Toporek, said. Dynamite Data said there had been a marked increase in how much Walmart played with prices, and smaller retailers, including GameStop, Best Buy and Toys ''R'' Us, were now also adjusting some prices at least daily. The goal is to attract shoppers with competitively priced products that show up on Web searches, but there is risk, too: some consumers tire of price whiplash. ''People are starting to realize, 'I can't trust the price I'm getting, because it might change,' '' a pricing consultant, Rafi Mohammed, said. Shoppers have few ways to gain an advantage -- ordering the same product at different prices requires expensive return shipments -- but Mr. Mohammed said retailers had an opportunity to soothe consumers by offering refunds for price adjustments. The parrying could be seen with a Nintendo game, Mario Kart DS. A week before Thanksgiving, the retailers' prices varied, with Amazon selling it at $29.17, Walmart at $40.88, and Target at $33.99, according to Dynamite Data. Through Thanksgiving, as Target kept the price stable, Walmart changed prices six times, and Amazon five. On Thanksgiving itself, Walmart marked down the price to its advertised $29.96, which Amazon matched. Ms. Schulz said sophisticated retailers set algorithms to change prices in response to competitors. ''Retailers pipe a bunch of information in electronically, like internal information -- cost, availability of inventory, sales goals,'' along with competitors' prices, she said. The software also lets retailers establish rules on the pricing of certain products: always price Furbys 5 percent below Kmart, for example, or make sure some goods are priced at an average of Amazon's and Walmart's prices. Generally, pricing managers also manually adjust prices. Mr. Toporek said Walmart.com used a combination of computer tools and human adjustments. On popular items, like Walmart's best sellers, the site tries to ''maintain low prices on the items people want the most,'' meaning it usually responds to competitors' price changes. Mr. Toporek said, however, that the site also tried not to jostle shoppers. ''Clearly we are making changes, but it's not the kind of constant change you're seeing on some other sites,'' he said. An Amazon spokeswoman, Pia Arthur, declined to offer details on Amazon's pricing strategy, and said in an e-mail that the company was ''working hard to meet or beat the lowest prices out there.'' Target declined to comment. A retailer can increase its sales volume when it has the lowest prices, especially because it will appear prominently in price comparison tools. For the children's tablet LeapPad1 Explorer, for instance, Walmart appeared to be purposely undercutting Amazon, even if by a matter of pennies. When Amazon offered the tablet for $59.99 on the Monday before Thanksgiving, Walmart priced it at $59.97. On the Sunday after Thanksgiving, Amazon raised the price to $69.99, and Walmart followed, going to $69.97. Sometimes a retailer cuts prices to tempt a competitor into offering a money-losing price and depleting its inventory. ''They'll wait until their competitor has sold out, and jump back into the game when the prices rise a little bit,'' said Ms. Schulz of Dynamite Data. While Target did not appear to shift prices nearly as frequently as Walmart and Amazon, it offered specials that spurred competitors into action. For a game called Telestrations, Walmart kept its price at $24.99 for the week. Amazon tried different prices, from $23.24 to $26.39, in the week before Thanksgiving, while Target held steady at $24.99. But when Target lowered the price to $18 on Black Friday, Amazon matched it. Decide.com, which offers consumers a tool suggesting when to buy, said that the retailers with the most volatile pricing included Buy.com, Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Sears. The most volatile product categories include games and consoles, printers, headphones, cameras, TVs and refrigerators. Dynamite Data also found that while many Amazon promotions over the weekend were at or near the lowest prices of the year, some were not that great -- even compared to Amazon itself. A Bodum wok, for instance, was priced at $119.95 before Thanksgiving, and Amazon offered a so-called lightning deal on Black Friday for $94.99. That seemed like a huge discount -- except that the same wok sold on Amazon for $59.99 just a few months ago. Some promoted discounts at Amazon, moreover, appeared steeper because the base price was increased before the Thanksgiving week markdown, Dynamite Data said. A Hewlett-Packard Envy notebook that cost $1,099.99 on Nov. 10, for example, was marked up to $1,179.97 by Nov. 20. That day, Amazon offered a limited-time deal at $849.99, a 28 percent discount from the marked-up price, but only 23 percent less than the Nov. 10 price. Consumers seemed good at evaluating deals, though. Later that week, Amazon offered another deal on that Envy computer, at $1,049.99. According to Dynamite Data, the sell-through rate was much slower than at $849.99. ''Consumers are becoming more savvy shoppers,'' Ms. Schulz said.

        "content": " Google Shopping has been giving itself a makeover in time for holiday shopping - and it is starting to look a lot more like Amazon.com. Last week, it  introduced wish lists   for saving items and sharing them with friends, 360-degree photographs of items, retailer promotions and product reviews. These updates came after Google made a big change   this fall, for the first time including retailers in Google Shopping only if they pay to list their products there. Google said this would make the listings better, because retailers would have an incentive to list up-to-date items. But as a result, Google Shopping's listings are less comprehensive than they were before. For example, Amazon has so far refused to pay for listings, so a Google search for the Kindle does not show Amazon, which makes the Kindle, in shopping results. On Search Engine Land, Danny Sullivan, a search industry expert, outlined in greater detail some of the service's recent weaknesses in a post called \" The Mess That Is Google Shopping .\" The lack of comprehensiveness means that Google risks losing shoppers to other comparison shopping sites or to Amazon, even as it tries to keep them. In a shift, more people now start product searches on Amazon instead of Google, according to Forrester data. That is a problem for Google for a few reasons, the biggest of which is that retail searches and search ads are among its biggest businesses. Google is trying to lure retailers by offering new features for its shopping search. They include 360-degree photos of items, starting with holiday toys. With Shortlists, people can save items they like and share lists with friends, and Google and retailers gain insight into what shoppers want to buy. Google is also trying to attract shoppers with exclusive promotions that retailers can offer through the site. These also show up on mobile apps for Google Maps and Google Offers. And Google has expanded its product reviews. Google has long drawn product reviews from around the Web, but now people can write their own on Google and see reviews from people they know on Google Plus ranked at the top when they do a product search. Reviews have been one of Amazon's biggest selling points for shopping search because of the volume of shoppers there. This shopping season will provide some clues as to whether Google can lure back some of the shoppers who have turned to Amazon for search.

        "content": " Is it just my imagination, or is the price of physical books on Amazon going up? I have no evidence beyond what I see as I browse through the retailer's virtual shelves, where I have routinely been noticing books selling for the same price they cost in the rest of the world. Selling at full price is not the sort of value proposition that propelled Amazon to its current perch as one of the country's biggest and most feared retailers. A few examples of books published in the last year or two that Amazon is offering at zero discount from list price:  \"Liebling's War: World War II Dispatches of A.J. Liebling.\"   Brian Boyd,  \"Stalking Nabokov.\"   Gerald Suttles,  \"Front   Page Economics.\"   Deborah Kohn,  \"The Latin American Literary Boom and U.S. Nationalism During the Cold   War.\"   Sandra Messinger Cypess,  \"Uncivil Wars: Elena Garro, Octavio Paz and the Battle for Cultural Memory.\"   Others are only marginally discounted: Ira Wood's  \"You're Married to Her,\"   published by Leapfrog in August, is available at a whopping 4 percent discount. I could get the book $2 cheaper  directly from Leapfrog . Juan Rulfo's  \"The Plain in Flames\"   is off 3 percent. (Here are some caveats: These are all new books sold by Amazon itself, not by third parties that may have damaged or used or other copies for cheaper. Books published by university presses are often available at a smaller discount than books from trade publishers. And yes, there are doubtless many popular books on Amazon at big discounts. But like many readers, I go to Amazon for the long tail -- little-known books that are unavailable in even the best-stocked bookshop.) The issue of pricing on Amazon matters for more than my pocketbook. The central question about the company has always been: How will it choose to make money? It has invested for the future for 18 years now, in the process demolishing much of the competition while giving it one of the priciest stocks on Wall Street. But at some point, somehow, it will have to become a normal business, which means selling things for more than it paid. One way to do that: erase discounts on books that readers cannot easily get anywhere else. Another possibility: Amazon is intentionally pricing its books higher so buyers will instead purchase from the cheaper third-party sellers, which are more profitable for Amazon. In other words, Amazon would rather run a mall or bazaar than try and be Wal-Mart. In response to a query, Amazon said, rather generally, that it wasn't raising prices. Amazon executives say the price of a book falls as it sells faster, but the site has always seemed more mysterious than that. Here's one example of a book dropping so fast it seemed to be falling out of the sky, but I doubt it was because people were gobbling up copies. In July, Arcade published  an omnibus of the works of the   Nobel laureate Octavio Paz . List price: $40. Over the rest of the summer and into the fall, the price tumbled. By Nov. 12, it was down to $1.32 -- a 97 percent drop. Mr. Paz is dead and out of fashion, so it seemed as if he was on a rather quick trip to the recycling bin. I finally took pity on the book and bought it. As a Prime member, I got it shipped for free. The book arrived promptly but was damaged. So I complained, and Amazon of course said it would send another and refund my postage. Now presumably Amazon is still paying the standard rate to Arcade for the book -- about $18. (Arcade didn't get back to me.) Amazon's total revenue from me on this deal was $1.32. It had to send me the book twice and refund my return $3.99 shipping. Overall I'd guess that Amazon lost about $30 on this transaction. Perhaps because I bought a copy, the book didn't last at $1.32. It is now back up to $11.34. Who ever thought that buying a physical book would have all the mystery and excitement of buying a plane ticket?

        "content": " Tim Ferriss, the author of the \"4-Hour\" series of self-help books for young men, hails from the nutritional supplements world, where the product is going to rot in the warehouse unless customers feel it is going to change their lives forever right now. Amazon, more than just about any other large tech company, does not pretend it sees any value in the old order. Bring these two elements together in the publication by Amazon of Mr. Ferriss' new book, \"The 4-Hour Chef,\" and the result is a lot of noise, hype and anger, as well as some hints about the future of book publishing. Here are a few preliminary conclusions: Anything can be a bookstore. The official publication date is Tuesday, but don't look for the book in Barnes & Noble or in many of the country's independent stores. They don't want to carry anything that will help the mighty Amazon extend its dominance. Instead, you could have seen the book Monday - even before it was officially on sale - in four Panera Bread outlets in Manhattan. Panera is doing a marketing deal with Mr. Ferriss. The book is also being promoted through the file-sharing site BitTorrent, which is typically used to pirate books rather than publicize them. When a book is published, the real work begins. In the old days, it certainly helped to be a good pitchman, but even if you were a rotten public speaker there were channels for promotion that did not involve your presence. Your publisher made a deal with Barnes & Noble and then there were stacks of your latest in the front of its stores. If the independent stores were a fan, they would get an early copy and talk it up to customers. With those outlets denied to Mr. Ferriss, he is enthusiastically holding contests and offering deals. Buy 25 physical books and get a bunch of bonuses, including a Kindle Fire. Interested in buying 4,000 copies? He'll come speak at your conference. The author who does not hustle his book in similar ways will soon find himself on the virtual  remainder shelf. If traditional publishing and traditional bookselling are going to survive, they are going to have to state their case in a way they never had to before. Mr. Ferriss  writes on his blog   that his book \"is a sniper shot directed at the heart of every member of the publishing oligarchy (not all publishers, mind you) who cares more about their parking spot at their country club than their end user: the reader.\" This is nonsense, of course - Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is rich enough to buy every country club in the land - but it is nevertheless effective positioning of the author as an insurgent man of the people. In a similar vein,  Mr. Ferriss   and   his publicists   make the claim that he is being \"boycotted\" and \"banned.\" If he is challenged on this, it is free publicity. If he is not, many will buy his argument. Everything is negotiable, starting with price.   Amazon is lowering  the Kindle price of \"The 4-Hour Chef\" for the first week by 50 percent, to $5, and trimmed the hardcover price to $16 for preorders. (List price is $35.) A traditional publisher could not afford to do these things, especially after giving Mr. Ferriss a seven-figure advance. But then Amazon, to the chagrin of its competitors, has never needed to make money. Everything will be a best seller, even if you have to give it away. Mr. Ferriss wants \"The 4-Hour Chef\" to be the first nonfiction book to sell a million copies on Kindle. My guess is that he and Amazon are willing to keep lowering the price until they get there. It is easy to see a set-up where only the most successful writers make much money. Everyone else will be giving their work away for free to establish an audience. The first victim here is going to be the English language.   The BitTorrent post  announcing their deal with Mr. Ferriss would earn a flunking grade from a high school English teacher for lines like, \"We'll be distributing the writer's process: the photos, drafts, videos and recipes that shaped Tim's journey.\" And then there's the reference to \"Julia Childs.\" Mr. Ferriss himself seems to be getting so overwrought about selling his book that  he is writing   sentences like,   \"It's the Red Coats versus the colonies, and I must take attack using different means.\" Can't figure out which side he's on? Me neither. Pulp Friction: The Kindle  Debate How Are 7-Inch Tablets  Doing?

        "name": "European Countries Seek More Taxes From U.S. Multinational Companies ",
        "content": " PARIS \u2014  Google   reported sales of more than $4 billion in Britain last year. It paid less than $10 million in taxes. Some tax collectors, lawmakers and competitors of Google in Europe say this is unfair. As governments throughout the region seek to close gaping holes in their budgets, they are taking aim at United States multinational companies, especially Internet giants like Google and  Amazon.com , which pay little or no taxes in Europe, despite generating billions of dollars in revenue on the Continent. \u201cWhy on earth do you manipulate your accounts so that you get away with not paying corporation tax in the U.K.?\u201d Margaret Hodge, a member of Parliament, asked representatives of Google, Amazon and  Starbucks   last week, during a heated committee hearing in London. In France, tax collectors have gone further. Amazon says it has received a bill from France for taxes and penalties related to the \u201callocation of income between foreign jurisdictions\u201d from 2006 through 2010. Other companies, including Google, are also reportedly in the French authorities\u2019 sights. \u201cEven if the Internet is a zone of freedom, it shouldn\u2019t be a lawless zone,\u201d Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, a spokeswoman for the French government, said last week. \u201cFiscal rules should be able to be applied to those activities as well.\u201d Google, Amazon, Starbucks and other American companies facing tax scrutiny say they are doing nothing wrong. They use complex accounting strategies to exploit national differences across Europe in corporate tax rates, which range from less than 10 percent to more than 30 percent, and loopholes that can reduce their effective European tax levies to almost nothing. Google, for example, records most of its international revenue at its European headquarters in Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is 12.5 percent. Across Europe, customers who buy advertising, Google\u2019s primary source of revenue, sign contracts with the company\u2019s subsidiary in Ireland, rather than with local branches. Google ends up paying Irish taxes on only a fraction of the billions of euros that course through its Dublin office. That is because the company uses a variety of methods, including royalty payments to a unit in Bermuda, to reduce further the amount of money exposed to tax liability. So, while Google told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it generated more than $4 billion in sales in Britain last year, it reported revenue of only \u00a3396 million, or $629 million, in its official filings there. The total, the company said, reflected the amount that Google\u2019s British unit billed Google Ireland for promotional work, consulting and other activities. Google declared a profit of \u00a331 million in Britain, resulting in a British tax bill of only \u00a36 million. \u201cWe pay the tax we are required to pay in every country in which we operate,\u201d Matt Brittin, Google vice president for North and Central Europe, told the parliamentary panel. Ms. Hodge, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, acknowledged that she thought Google, Amazon and Starbucks were probably complying with the law. \u201cWe are not accusing you of being illegal, we are accusing you of being immoral,\u201d she said. In France, more than morality is at stake. In his testimony to the parliamentary panel, Andrew Cecil, director of public policy for Amazon in Europe, confirmed that the company had received a demand for $252 million from the French tax collection agency. He said Amazon was contesting the claim, which was originally disclosed in an American regulatory filing. Amazon, which has European headquarters in Luxembourg, another small country with favorable tax conditions for multinational companies, reported 9.1 billion euros, or $11.6 billion, in revenue across Europe last year. It posted an after-tax profit of 20 million euros on those sales, and paid about 8 million euros in tax, Mr. Cecil said. Mr. Cecil told the parliamentary committee that when customers across Europe bought books from Amazon, they were actually buying them from the Luxembourg-based Amazon entity, rather than their local subsidiaries. That response was met with incredulity by Ms. Hodge, who noted that when she ordered a book from the company, she used a British Web site,  Amazon.co.uk , and the goods were delivered from a British warehouse via the British Royal Mail. News reports in France note that French fiscal authorities are also seeking back taxes and penalties from Google, amounting to 1.7 billion euros. Ms. Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters that she could not comment on individual companies for privacy reasons. Google, in a statement, said the reports were premature. \u201cGoogle has not received any tax assessment from the French tax administration,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe have and will continue to cooperate with the authorities in France.\u201d Europe is not the only place where the complex tax arrangements of United States multinationals are being questioned. The authorities in Australia have sent Apple a bill for 28.5 million Australian dollars, or about $29.5 million, in back taxes, according to news reports Friday. Apple could not be reached for comment. In an era of globalization, determining the tax liability of multinational companies has long vexed policy makers and tax collectors. International agreements generally state that commerce should be taxed in the physical location where profit-making activity occurs, not necessarily where a customer is based or where a transaction takes place. Determining the appropriate jurisdiction for taxation is especially difficult with Internet businesses, because of the intangible nature of many of the goods and services that change hands and the ease with which transactions can cross borders. Google says that most of the economic value it creates is generated in Silicon Valley, where its engineers toil away at the computer algorithms behind its search engine and other services. So the company says it is fair that most of what it pays in taxes goes to the United States Treasury, not its foreign counterparts. While Google\u2019s United States taxes have come under scrutiny, too, the company pays substantially more in the United States. In 2011, the company\u2019s annual report shows, it made a provision of $2.6 billion for income taxes, all but $248 million of that going to the state and national treasuries in the United States. Based on pretax income of $12.3 billion, that amounted to an effective rate of 21 percent. \u201cIf Google was a British business, if Google had been founded in Cambridge by Larry and Sergey, I think we\u2019d be in a very different place here, because the profitability would rightly sit where all the technology and innovation take place, which is not here,\u201d Mr. Brittin said. He was referring to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google. Though Google employees across Europe advise clients on the use of the company\u2019s services, advertisers sign contracts with the company\u2019s subsidiary in Ireland. This has shielded Google from tax liability in France, Britain and other European countries, at least so far. \u201cGoogle is saying, \u2018We just float around freely above this useful aircraft carrier, Ireland,\u2019 \u201d said Richard Murphy, founder of the Tax Justice Network, an independent organization that campaigns against what it calls tax \u201cloopholes and distortions.\u201d \u201cWhat France is saying is, \u2018We don\u2019t think you float around over Ireland, we think you are in France.\u2019 \u201d If Google believes that its profit-making activity \u2014 that is, its taxable work \u2014 occurs in the United States, Mr. Murphy said, then it ought to take its European earnings home and expose them to the Internal Revenue Service. Yet, like many other American multinationals, it has been reluctant to do so. Instead, Google said it had accumulated $24.8 billion as of the end of 2011 outside the United States \u2014 part of a cache of stored American corporate cash that Citizens for Tax Justice, an American advocacy group, estimates at more than $1.5 trillion. The money has been accumulating in Bermuda and other offshore havens since a 2004 United States tax holiday for the repatriation of corporate profits. While some American corporate leaders have been lobbying in Washington for another tax holiday, lawmakers in Europe are moving to collect a greater share of multinationals\u2019 taxes. Last spring, the European Parliament threw its support behind a proposal to create a single set of European Union-wide accounting rules for calculating multinational corporations\u2019 tax liabilities. But policy makers are divided over whether the standards should be voluntary or mandatory. Ms. Vallaud-Belkacem said last week that the administration of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France was discussing with other European governments ways to crack down on tax avoidance by international companies. After a meeting this month, George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, and Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble of Germany called for \u201cconcerted international cooperation to strengthen international standards for corporate tax regimes.\u201d Mr. Osborne said in a statement, \u201cWe want competitive taxes that say Britain is open for business and that attract global companies to invest in and bring jobs to our country, but we also want global companies to pay those taxes.\u201d",

        "name": "The Tablet Market Grows Cluttered ",
        "content": " Holiday shoppers with a tablet computer on their gift list this year might be forgiven for feeling a little panicked. Look at the tablets available online or at a consumer electronics store and it can be dizzying to choose from among the dozens of slim rectangles with touch screens -- each with various sizes, features, prices and applications. Tablets were supposed to be a simple alternative to the bloated personal computer market. And when ''tablet'' was synonymous with ''iPad,'' that was true. But this is the first holiday season in which the iPad faces competitors that have built up a solid footing in the market. Amazon and Google introduced tablets just in time for the shopping rush. As a result, many consumers and analysts say, the new market of keyboardless computers is quickly becoming as confusing as that of the old-school PC. ''What's different about this holiday season is that consumers have not just more choice, but really good choices,'' said Sarah Rotman Epps, who studies consumer computing trends at Forrester. ''There have been many iPad wannabes but no real quality alternatives, and now there are several.'' While choice is a good thing for consumers, she said, it also makes shopping ''confusing and complicated.'' For the companies that make tablets, the choice means everything. The stakes are much higher than the sale of individual devices. Each company is trying to snag lifelong customers for their other products -- like music, apps, e-books, movies, Web search or word-processing software. While Apple has dominated the market until now, selling more tablets than any other company, its perch is being threatened by the newcomers. ''Apple left a lot of room for rivals to grow,'' said Tero Kuittinen, an independent mobile analyst. By keeping its tablet prices so high, he said, Apple could lose its place as the biggest tablet seller, just as it did with smartphones when it lost the first-place position to Samsung, which makes less expensive phones using Google's Android software. The iPad still dominates the market with a 50 percent share, according to third-quarter figures from the research firm IDC, but that is down from 60 percent a year ago. Samsung is in second place with an 18 percent share, Amazon is third with 9 percent, and Asus, which makes Google's Nexus 7 tablet, is in fourth with 8.6 percent of the market. But Google, which makes the vast majority of its revenue on Web ads, still lags in the tablet market, even though sales of its Nexus 7 tablet are approaching one million a month, according to Asus. About 98 percent of Web traffic from tablets comes from iPads, according to Onswipe, a digital publishing company. Google would like more of that traffic, as well as more buyers for apps and media from its Google Play store, as would Amazon and Microsoft. ''The first decision you make is what ecosystem am I in, do I want the Android Play store and content or some other?'' said Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's vice president for engineering for Android. ''So the importance of the ecosystem can't be overstated.'' But the decisions after that are still complex. Say, for example, that you want a tablet that runs Google's Android operating system. There is the Nexus 7, a seven-inch tablet made by Asus, and the Nexus 10, a 10-inch tablet made by Samsung. Then there are the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (not to be confused with the Samsung Galaxy Note 2, a 5.5-inch smartphone). And that's not to mention the dozens of Android tablets made by Lenovo, Toshiba and others. This year, Microsoft also has a tablet, called Surface. Amazon has the Kindle Fire and Fire HD, and Barnes & Noble has the Nook HD and HD+. Once shoppers choose one, they have more choices to make, like whether they want to pay $15 more for the privilege of not seeing ads on the Kindle Fire. Even Apple, which has always prided itself on having simple product lines, now offers the new iPad, the older iPad 2 and the iPad Mini. If you factor in the various amounts of storage and the choice of cellular data or just Wi-Fi, there are essentially 14 iPad models to choose from. Complicating the decision on hardware, different tablets connect to different online stores for apps, music and video. If you have built your music and app collection on Apple devices, an Android tablet may mean starting from scratch, and vice versa. The proliferation of products is nothing new for a mature market, as anyone who has stood in front of a wall of televisions at Best Buy or in a parking lot of Priuses at a Toyota dealership knows. But some consumer electronics companies that have given their customers too many options have run into trouble, said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee. They include Motorola Mobility, which is trying to rescue its cellphone business by paring its lineup of 27 devices, and Research in Motion, which offers a perplexing matrix of BlackBerrys with confusing names, like the BlackBerry Torch 9810, 9850 and 9860. Google in particular runs this risk, said Michael Gartenberg, a technology analyst at Gartner, because it gives away its Android operating system to any device manufacturer that wants to use it, resulting in an uncontrolled array of Android devices running different versions of the software. Some apps will work only with particular versions, making it difficult to know exactly what you are getting. Google has tried to address this problem in recent months. It gave its line of Nexus products names corresponding to their screen size and began selling them in its Play store. (Google teams up with manufacturers to build the Nexus devices.) It began running ads for the tablets online, on billboards, in print and on television, which had been rare for the company, and assigned a public relations employee to focus on selling hardware to consumers. ''I don't think the added choice is adding complexity,'' said Mr. Lockheimer of Google. ''If you want to do the research, you can do it, but if you don't want to, you can just ignore all that and get the thing your friend or family member recommended.'' For shoppers inclined to do the research, many Web sites and apps, including those from CNet, Retrevo, Decide.com and Consumer Reports, can help. ''Even those of us who eat and breathe tech, we're still confused,'' said Lawrence Fong, co-founder of BuyVia, a shopping app that compares products, including tablets. ''That's why we're explaining each product in plain English.'' The default choice for shoppers, Ms. Rotman Epps said, is often an iPad. ''It is a road-tested product, it comes with the Apple quality halo around Apple's brand, and it's leagues ahead in terms of the apps available for it,'' she said. But iPads are more expensive than other tablets. They range from $330 for the least expensive iPad Mini to $830 for a 64-gigabyte iPad with cellular data and Wi-Fi. Google and Amazon advertise their tablets as offering the best value. The Nexus 7 starts at $200 and the Kindle Fire starts around $160. Microsoft says the Surface, which starts at $500, is better for getting work done, because you can hook up a mouse, type more easily with an add-on keyboard and cover, and use some Office applications. But the bold design of Microsoft's new tablet software and hardware could be too confusing for Windows users, who tend to be less tech-savvy, Ms. Rotman Epps said. ''Given the profile of who wants to buy a Windows tablet, complexity is not a good thing,'' she said. For many people, the biggest factor to consider when choosing a tablet is where it takes them once they turn it on -- that is, which services, apps and stores selling books and music they can use. ''We've been in love with the glass,'' said Mark Curtis, chief client officer at Fjord, a mobile design firm. ''Now we're going to fall in love with what's behind the glass. It's about the services they can offer.'' And, as often happens when a market matures and becomes saturated, companies are beginning to look beyond tablets to the next generation of devices, which might be worn on people's bodies or installed in their homes, Mr. Curtis said. If you think this year's holiday shopping list is complicated, wait until next year, when it might include Internet-connected watches, eyeglasses or coffee pots.

        "content": " When you see a merger between two giants in a declining industry, it can look like the financial version of a  couple having a baby to save a marriage. At least that was my thought when Random House and Penguin, two of the world\u2019s six largest publishers,  announced that they were coming together   last month. Ever since Amazon began ripping apart the book business, the largest houses have been looking for a way to fight back. If this merger is any indication, they have chosen an old-fashioned strategy: Size. A combined Penguin-Random House, which would control a quarter of the global book market, is a conglomerate designed to take on another giant, though it\u2019s not exactly a fair fight. Because the new entity will only have about a twelfth of Amazon\u2019s annual sales, most observers expect that this is just the beginning of a series of mergers \u2014 like those in the music business \u2014 that will take the Big Six publishers down to the Big Three and perhaps one day even the Big One. As John Makinson, Penguin\u2019s chief executive, told The Times, \u201cWe decided it was better to get in early rather than be a follower.\u201d The question is whether this strategy will work. There are two competing predictions about commerce in the digital age. One is that companies will get smaller and more disruptive as nimble entrepreneurs can take on giant corporations with little more than 3-D printers and Web sites. The other envisions a few massive companies \u2014 like Procter & Gamble, Apple and Nike \u2014 that design everything themselves, have it manufactured cheaply in Asia and use their e-commerce sites to gather information about their customers. Nearly the exact same conflict occurred more than a century ago in the decade that straddled 1900, which was also a period of rapid technological change. In just a few years, 1,800 small companies were swallowed up as the electrical-power, telephone, auto, steel and chemical industries grew from patchworks of tiny companies into conglomerates. In \u201cThe Great Merger Movement in American Business 1895-1904,\u201d the Yale economist and historian Naomi Lamoreaux wrote that back then everyone worried about the same thing that authors, editors and book buyers worry about now: Are large companies good for the economy? Do they grow through efficiency and innovation or by abusing their leverage? Lamoreaux found that they did both, and many turn-of-the-century examples suggest what might happen to Penguin-Random and others. On one end of the spectrum, Lamoreaux told me, was U.S. Steel. Its predecessor companies competed by finding new ways of making steel at ever-lower prices. But after J. P. Morgan merged three companies into one behemoth, he discovered a better way to profit. Because all steel producers bought iron ore from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota, U.S. Steel bought most of the range and locked much of the rest of it in long-term contracts. As a result, the company hardly worried about competition; it had little need to innovate or compete on price, which made everything from cars to soda cans more expensive. Worse, it left a massive industry unprepared for the growth of innovative Asian companies during the 1970s and 1980s. By then, U.S. Steel all but collapsed, and a chunk of the U.S. economy went down with it. Sears & Roebuck, on the other end, \u201cgrew by solving market and technical problems,\u201d Lamoreaux said, and, as it solved them, its market share increased. Unable to monopolize anything like iron ore, Sears needed to innovate to stay ahead. Through constant competition with Montgomery Ward and others, it adopted new strategies that ultimately benefited its customers. When the company got into trouble, closed stores and was bought in 2005 by a struggling competitor, Kmart, the retail industry was robust enough that the overall economy barely noticed. The future of book publishing is somewhere between the two poles. Oddly enough, it seems to mirror what happened to the envelope business. In the early 1900s the envelope industry was large enough to support several big companies. Then the mergers started, and an industry of numerous small companies became two giants. Eventually, the envelope industry wasn\u2019t large enough to sustain itself, and the companies became tiny divisions of larger conglomerates. U.S. Envelope still lives as a small part of the packaging manufacturer MeadWestvaco. American Envelope was bought by Cenveo, a business-stationery company whose chief executive, Robert G. Burton Sr., made clear that the century of mergers and buyouts is not over. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people knocking on the door,\u201d he told shareholders in August. This kind of consolidation started in publishing long before the Penguin-Random merger. Random House, an arm of the media company Bertelsmann in Germany, is itself made up of former independents like Knopf and Pantheon. Penguin, a division of the education publisher Pearson, contains Dutton, Viking and others. If market forces were the only concern, it\u2019s possible that there would soon be only one or two publishers and that they might be folded into some larger infotainment company like Time Warner Penguin or maybe Random Viacom. There would still be books \u2014 just not large book companies. Every analysis I\u2019ve read of the Penguin-Random House merger mentions the inevitable scrutiny of the antitrust lawyers at the Department of Justice, who are eager to prevent any potential monopoly in publishing. But it\u2019s difficult to imagine how, in the digital world, publishers could ever monopolize the sale of written material. Even if there were only one house left, it would compete with every blogger and self-published e-book author. Eventually, it\u2019s likely that book publishing will embody both conflicting visions of digital-age commerce \u2014 lots of small businesses and a few massive ones that handle big-ticket items. History suggests that the antitrust lawyers should be more concerned about government-issued patents, which allow large corporations to buy up vaguely worded deeds that can be used to sue upstarts out of existence. This is the iron ore of the digital age and many large companies are gobbling up as many patents as they can. Reuters recently reported that Amazon (which somehow holds a patent for the \u201cone-click shopping\u201d button) was hiring several high-profile patent lawyers with the mandate to \u201cidentify and evaluate strategic I.P. acquisition and licensing opportunities.\u201d The company has argued that it buys up patents to defend against the lawsuits of others. That may be partly true, but the worst fate for readers isn\u2019t the merger of a few struggling companies in a diminishing business. It\u2019s the threat of another U.S. Steel. Deep thoughts this week: Book publishing is turning to mergers out of desperation. Will it work? The answer may lie in the envelope industry, which survived by disappearing.",

        "content": " Technology doesn't win political campaigns, but it certainly is a weapon -- a force multiplier, in military terms. Both  sides in the presidential contest mined click-stream data as never before   to target messages to potential voters. But a real edge for the Obama campaign was in its use of online and mobile technology to support its much-praised ground game, finding potential supporters and urging them to vote, either in person or by phone, according to two senior members of the Obama technology team, Michael Slaby, chief integration and innovation officer for the Obama campaign, and Harper Reed, chief technology officer for the Obama campaign. A program called \"Dashboard,\" for example, allowed volunteers to join a local field team and get assignments remotely. The Web application -- viewable on smartphones or tablets -- showed the location of field workers, neighborhoods to be canvassed, and blocks where help was needed. \"It allowed people to join a neighborhood team without ever going to a central office,\" said Mr. Slaby. Another ground-game program was a tool for telephone canvassing from people's homes instead of having to travel to a campaign office and work from a telephone bank. The call tool was a Web program that let people sign up to make calls and receive a list of phone numbers, names and a script to use, noted Mr. Reed. Often, the profiles of volunteer callers and the lists they received were matched. So the callers were people with similar life experiences to those being called, and thus more likely to be persuasive. Here is a  YouTube video of a   91-year-old World War II veteran,   who joined the Obama phone corps. In 2008, there were some remote callers in the Obama campaign. But this year, there were ten times as many, Mr. Slaby said. The sheer scale of the online outreach and data collection dwarfed the effort four years ago. For example, the Barack ObamaFacebook site had 33 million \"likes,\" compared with 2 million for the previous campaign. A Facebook like, Mr. Slaby noted, is the \"just the first rung on a ladder of engagement\" but it is a starting point. Another truly important change was in the technology itself. \"Cloud computing barely existed in 2008,\" Mr. Slaby said. This time, the Obama campaign's data center was mainly Amazon Web Services, the leading supplier of cloud services. The campaign's engineers built about 200 different programs that ran on the Amazon service including Dashboard, the remote calling tool, the campaign Web site, donation processing and data analytics applications. Using mainly open-source software and the Amazon service, the Obama campaign could inexpensively write and tailor its own programs instead of using off-the-shelf commercial software. \"It let us attack and engineer our own approach to problems, and build solutions for an environment that moves so rapidly you can't plan,\" Mr. Slaby said. \"It made a huge difference this time.\" Supercomputing Rented by the  Hour Amazon Cloud Failure Takes Down Web  Sites A Big Data Road Map for  Government Cloud Computing for the Poorest  Countries President Obama Takes Questions From the Internet on Reddit",

Amazon's  Kindle Fire line of tablets   and  Google's Nexus 7   model are both considered to be Android tablets, but the Kindle Fire uses a customized version of the system. Unlike Apple's tightly controlled iOS mobile operating system, the Android software, which is made by Google, has been adapted for use by many hardware manufacturers for their own phones and tablets. Amazon's version of Android is focused on easy navigation for the content on the Kindle and getting to features like Amazon Prime Instant Video and other content from the massive online store. The Kindle's version of Android does not run as many apps as Google's Nexus 7 with its unmodified Android system, but it supports the common ones: Twitter, Facebook, Pandora, Angry Birds and other popular pastimes. (While it is possible to manually install Android apps from other sources on the Kindle, many people just stick with the apps available for download right on the device.) The Google Nexus 7 is geared more to app lovers and people who like to tinker with tablets; a larger Nexus 10 is also available. Google's tablets tend to get Android updates first and can run a huge amount of apps from the  Google Play store , so if you are less interested in entertainment and more into apps, the Nexus 7 may be a better fit.

        "name": "Booksellers Resisting Amazon\u2019s Disruption ",
        "content": " SAN FRANCISCO \u2014  Amazon   prides itself on unraveling the established order. This fall, signs of Amazon-inspired disruption are everywhere. There is the slow-motion crackup of electronics showroom Best Buy. There is Amazon\u2019s rumored entry into the wine business, which is already agitating competitors. And there is the merger of Random House and Penguin, an effort to create a mega-publisher sufficiently hefty to negotiate with the retailer on equal terms. Amazon inspires anxiety just about everywhere, but its publishing arm is getting pushback from all sorts of booksellers, who are scorning the imprint\u2019s most prominent title, Timothy Ferriss\u2019s \u201cThe 4-Hour Chef.\u201d That book is coming out just before Thanksgiving into a fragmented book-selling landscape that Amazon has done much to create but that eludes its control. Mr. Ferriss\u2019s first book, \u201cThe 4-Hour Workweek,\u201d sold nearly a half-million copies in its original print edition, according to Nielsen BookScan. A follow-up devoted to the body did nearly as well. Those books about finding success without trying too hard were a particular hit with young men, who identified with their quasi-scientific entrepreneurial spirit. Signing Mr. Ferriss was seen as a smart choice by Amazon, which wanted books that would make a splash in both the digital and physical worlds. When the seven-figure deal was announced in August 2011, Mr. Ferriss, a former nutritional supplements marketer, said this was \u201ca chance to really show what the future of books looks like.\u201d Now that publication is at hand, that future looks messy and angry. Barnes & Noble, struggling to remain relevant in Amazon\u2019s shadow, has been emphatic that it will not carry its competitor\u2019s books. Other large physical and digital stores seem to be uninterested or even opposed to the book. Many independent stores feel betrayed by Mr. Ferriss, whom they had championed. They will do nothing to help him if it involves helping a company they feel is hellbent on their destruction. \u201cAt a certain point you have to decide how far you want to nail your own coffin shut,\u201d said Michael Tucker, owner of the Books Inc. chain here. \u201cAmazon wants to completely control the entire book trade. You\u2019re crazy if you want to play that game with them.\u201d Bill Petrocelli, co-owner of Book Passage, a large store in suburban Marin County, expressed similar reservations. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s in our best interests to do business with Amazon,\u201d he said. Crown, a division of Random House, took on Mr. Ferriss in 2007, after more than two dozen publishers said no to him. \u201cCrown put in a lot of effort to promote those books,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli said. \u201cHe decided to walk away. That\u2019s his decision to make but I can\u2019t say I applaud it. I think writers should be supportive of publishers that are supportive of them.\u201d This isn\u2019t a full-fledged boycott. Books Inc. and Book Passage said they would special order \u201cThe 4-Hour Chef\u201d for anyone who wanted one. And some independent stores will even display it, if not enthusiastically. Green Apple, another big independent San Francisco store, said it would stock the book, figuring that if there was money to be made on its sale, better Green Apple make it than Amazon. But Kevin Ryan, the store\u2019s buyer, said there were limits. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go out of our way to promote something from Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stretch.\u201d When Mr. Ferriss signed with Amazon, he celebrated the new at the expense of the old. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m giving up anything, financially or otherwise,\u201d he said. He has a somewhat different view these days. \u201cBy signing with Amazon, I expected this type of blowback,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been girding my loins.\u201d The irony, he added, is that the $35 book was meant to be inviting to the casual browser. Amazon can do many things, but it still cannot let readers examine a book before buying. \u201cThis is the kind of book that physical booksellers would be most excited to sell,\u201d Mr. Ferriss said. Only a few years ago, culture was delivered in discrete doses. \u201cThe 4-Hour Chef\u201d would have been in the chain bookstores by the stacks and in independents by the handful. You wanted a book, you went to the bookstore. Simple. Now the technology overlords \u2014 Amazon, Google and Apple \u2014 are competing among themselves and with other players to control how the culture is consumed. Amazon\u2019s Kindle Fire was introduced last year to carve out some space from Apple\u2019s iPad; since then, Google and Microsoft have brought out their own tablets. There is constant jockeying for position. Amazon, for instance, is at odds with Wal-Mart and Target, both of which have stopped selling the Kindle, worried that it is a Trojan horse that will lure their customers away. All the technology companies hope to bind users to their devices as tablet use explodes. There are about 70,000 activations every day of tablets powered by Google\u2019s Android software. That is a vast number of potential readers, but Google Play, a media store for these devices, does not offer the big books Amazon published this fall. It does, however, offer downloads of a popular book Amazon published several years ago, \u201cThe Hangman\u2019s Daughter.\u201d A Google spokeswoman referred calls to Amazon. \u201cWe\u2019re going to decline to participate,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman said. Wal-Mart, asked if it would be selling \u201cThe 4-Hour Chef,\u201d said only that it would be offered online through  Walmart.com . Target said it isn\u2019t carrying the book, although it is carrying both online and in stores other new cookbooks published by the traditional presses, like Lidia Matticchio Bastianich\u2019s \u201cLidia\u2019s Favorite Recipes.\u201d Amazon has been publishing books since 2009. Most of its imprints are run out of its Seattle offices, including lines for mysteries and romances. Authors who write for these imprints say they are doing well, sometimes extremely well. Their sales are largely digital. They live within the Amazon ecosystem, selling their books from the retailer\u2019s Web site. For the moment, though, a book that aspires to be a genuine national best seller needs more than that. And that is where the books being acquired by Amazon in New York, which are distributed to the book trade by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt under the New Harvest imprint, are faltering. Its editors, led by a longtime publishing operative, Laurence Kirshbaum, seem to have backed off, at least for the time being, from buying prominent books. \u201cI had expected more,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, a Forrester technology analyst. \u201cI expected them to find the next \u2018Hunger Games.\u2019 I expected the next  Harry Potter   to come through Amazon. They have not changed the world like many assumed they would.\u201d In September, Amazon published the movie director Penny Marshall\u2019s \u201cMy Mother Was Nuts.\u201d According to Nielsen BookScan, it has sold 8,000 hardcover copies. \u201cThat should have sold 50,000, but they couldn\u2019t go through the brick and mortar stores,\u201d said Mr. Tucker of Books Inc. He declined to sell that one too, and so apparently did just about everyone that wasn\u2019t Amazon. Ms. Marshall\u2019s agent did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment. As publication approaches, Mr. Ferriss has started aggressively promoting \u201cThe 4-Hour Chef\u201d on his blog, announcing a weight-loss contest. The book might need all of his considerable promotional talents. It has not yet generated instant heat even on Amazon; on Sunday it was ranked No. 597 in books and 4,318 in the Kindle Store. \u201cThe 4-Hour Workweek,\u201d in an updated edition published in 2009, was by contrast No. 328 in books and 2,723 in Kindle. \u201cThe nature of experiments is that sometimes you succeed and sometimes you fail,\u201d Mr. Ferriss said. \u201cThis could be a landmark in a lot of ways, for better or worse.\u201d Active in Cloud, Amazon Reshapes  Computing Amazon Signs Up Authors, Writing Publishers Out of Deal",

        "content": " Executives at the TV networks and other news gathering operations said they were committed to holding off proclaiming a winner in the presidential election on Tuesday until they were confident of a winner,  Brian Stelter   reported . The promised restraint shows that the networks are fully aware that Web sites and individuals on social media services like Twitter and Facebook undoubtedly would be sharing results as soon as they come in, rushing to call the race. The support for Mitt Romney from the influential conservative radio and online host Glenn Beck has taken a special form,   Amy Chozick  writes . Mr. Beck, who is Mormon like Mr. Romney, has attempted to be a bridge between the candidate and the evangelic Christians in his audience. There is a long history of skepticism among evangelicals about Mormonism, and Mr. Beck engaged those concerns directly during special one-hour show. Its title: \"Does Mitt Romney's Mormonism make him too scary or weird to be elected to president of the United States?\" Mr. Beck's answer at the end: \"It's not weird to be a Mormon, and it's not weird to be president if you're Mormon.\" While American newspapers have come to accept the way Google News operates - creating a page of headlines and summaries (as well as links) to articles created by news publications - the fight from publishers overseas continues,  David Carr writes . There is a large boycott of Google News under way in Brazil, legislation aimed at Google in Germany, and perhaps similar legislation in France. In an interview, Eric E. Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, described the company's view: \"Whenever you are dealing with government, you want to be very clear about what you will do and will not do. And we don't want to pay for content that we do not host. We are very clear on that.\" Google's dominant position in search has lately drawn the attention of regulators in the United States and Europe, who are questioning whether the company exploits its size to stifle competition. For many small Web sites,   Steve Lohr and Claire Cain Miller  write , the search engine is the sun their businesses revolve around - they watch each day to see that it rises same as before. If it doesn't - if somehow the rankings suddenly change - the small Web site can wither away. \"The 4-Hour Chef\" by Timothy Ferriss, who has become a best-selling author by offering a path to success without trying too hard, is getting the cold shoulder from bricks-and-mortar booksellers,  David Streitfeld reports . Mr. Ferriss was a big signing by Amazon's publishing unit, and it is his connection to Amazon that is hurting his cause among booksellers. Barnes & Noble won't sell Amazon books; many independent bookstores say they feel betrayed by Mr. Ferriss. \"We don't think it's in our best interests to do business with Amazon,\" said Bill Petrocelli, co-owner of Book Passage, a large store in suburban Marin County, Calif. The seemingly arcane question of what royalties are paid to stream music digitally is again being considered by Congress,  Ben Sisario writes , with potentially great meaning for how the public listens to music. At issue is the lower rate charged to satellite radio outlets like Sirius XM when compared to streaming music sites like Pandora. To Pandora, which pays more than half of its revenues in royalties, the system is unfairly rigged against it. To musicians and the record labels, the outlier is the rate charged to satellite radio, which they argue should be lifted to match Pandora's. Mark Thompson, who next Monday is set to become president and chief executive of The New York Times Company, navigated eight years atop the British Broadcasting Company,  Matthew Purdy writes , only to have a scandal involving Jimmy Savile cast a shadow over his tenure there. Late last year, the BBC show \"Newsnight\" decided not to pursue an investigation of accusations of child sexual abuse against Mr. Savile - an investigation Mr. Thompson said he knew nothing about before it was canceled by the editor of the show. Mr. Purdy writes: Interviews with former BBC executives and officials here in London show that in the months after the investigation was canceled, Mr. Thompson and his top executives repeatedly missed opportunities to pursue a fuller picture of the \"Newsnight\" reporting, the fate of the program and, perhaps, of Mr. Savile.

When the seven-figure deal was announced in August 2011, Mr. Ferriss, a former nutritional supplements marketer, said this was \"a chance to really show what the future of books looks like.\" Now that publication is at hand, that future looks messy and angry. Barnes & Noble, struggling to remain relevant in Amazon's shadow, has been emphatic that it will not carry its competitor's books. Other large physical and digital stores seem to be uninterested or even opposed to the book. Many independent stores feel betrayed by Mr. Ferriss, whom they had championed. They will do nothing to help him if it involves helping a company they feel is hellbent on their destruction. \"At a certain point you have to decide how far you want to nail your own coffin shut,\" said Michael Tucker, owner of the Books Inc. chain in San Francisco. \"Amazon wants to completely control the entire book trade. You're crazy if you want to play that game with them.\" When Mr. Ferriss signed with Amazon, he celebrated the new at the expense of the old. \"I don't feel like I'm giving up anything, financially or otherwise,\" he said. He has a somewhat different view these days. \"By signing with Amazon, I expected this type of blowback,\" he said. \"I've been girding my loins.\" Google Is Testing Same-Day Delivery for  Shoppers Amazon Starts a Shopping Site for the Environmental  Crowd Daily Report: Storm Makes the Cloud Look  Riskier NetSuite Moves to 'Commerce as a Service ' Amazon Puts 'Harry Potter' Series in Kindle Library",

If you purchased a Kindle labeled  \"With Special Offers,\"   you bought a model that was discounted because of the advertisements shown on the reader's screen saver and along the bottom of the home screen.

To turn off the ads (or as Amazon calls it, \"unsubscribe from special offers\"), log onto the  Manage Your Kindle   page with your Amazon user name and password. In the Manage Your Devices area, find your Kindle model and click the plus (+) icon to show additional details. In the Special Offers area, click Edit and follow along to turn off the ads.

        "name": "In Seattle, Virtual University Will Have a Physical Campus, Too ",
        "content": " SEATTLE \u2014 With name tags clipped on and PowerPoint at the ready, officials from  Northeastern University   invited prospective students in one night last week for a peek at a new extension campus, 2,500 miles from the school\u2019s home in Boston and about as far northwest as you can get in the lower 48 without swim fins. It is a trend that many colleges and universities have embraced in recent years \u2014 remote campuses to extend the brand and the flow of tuition checks. But there was more going on here. And all the new dean, J. Tayloe Washburn, had to do to demonstrate that was walk to the bank of windows in the meeting room where the prospects and the staff had congregated and throw wide his arms: the headquarters buildings of the tech giant Amazon.com filled the view under a gray Seattle mist. \u201cWe\u2019re very aware we\u2019ll be sitting across the street from 12,000 Amazon workers,\u201d said Mr. Washburn, a prominent Seattle lawyer and former chairman of the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce. Remember the notion that technology would destroy the idea of place, creating work forces of telecommuters and disembodied companies \u2014 or universities, for that matter \u2014 that were no longer anchored anywhere because they did not have to be? Turns out to have been entirely wrong, say Northeastern officials, who are enthused over what they see as a post-recession technology boom in the making in places like Seattle, and one where postgraduate science and technology workers are in particularly short supply Being where the action is, with a smile and shoeshine and the reputation of a 114-year-old research university to back it all up, they say, is more important than ever. Starting in January, Northeastern will offer online graduate-level courses here, taught by instructors back East, alongside real classroom courses in a Seattle neighborhood called South Lake Union, once more known for warehouses than Wi-Fi. In recent years, a cluster of health science research and computer science companies have also gathered to rub shoulders with Amazon. \u201cYou have to be present on the ground, you have to understand the community, you have to become part of the community,\u201d Northeastern\u2019s president, Joseph E. Aoun, said in a telephone interview. A reliance on remote learning alone does not, he said, build relationships, a word he used repeatedly. \u201cIt\u2019s mutually reinforcing \u2014 the virtual is going to lead you to have the need for a physical presence and physical contact,\u201d he said, \u201cand the physical contact is being supplemented by the virtual dimensions.\u201d Economists and urban affairs experts say that in a strange way, the Great Recession intensified the concentration of technology workers here that Northeastern is aiming for. Industries like finance and construction, which had been big local job generators before the crash, fell away sharply, but Seattle-area stalwarts like Amazon, Boeing and Microsoft continued to grow, or at least hold stable. At the same time, the University of Washington \u2014 the dominant higher education institution in Seattle, and also a neighbor to Amazon \u2014 got battered by years of deep budget cuts and  tuition increases   during the recession, as did many other public universities across the nation. \u201cWhat the recession did is it froze a lot of people in place,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, an associate professor at the University of Washington who teaches American urban history and has written widely about technology centers, especially Silicon Valley. \u201cBut it also, in a way, entrenched the geography of innovation, in part because people weren\u2019t selling and buying homes with such quickness and it was a little harder to change jobs.\u201d And all that compounded the larger trend, she said: \u201cIn a digital world, place matters more than ever.\u201d The president of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, Maud Daudon, said that having Northeastern in town, especially in the emerging hub around Amazon, could itself be a new draw to the area. \u201cNortheastern\u2019s presence will help to close the gap between businesses trying to fill positions, and trained, qualified candidates available to go to work,\u201d she said. She said that with thousands of people expected to move into the area in the next few years, there is even talk of a South Lake Union area public school. As of the middle of this year, 20 residential apartment and condominium projects were under construction downtown, up from three in 2010, according to the  Downtown Seattle   Association , a nonprofit economic development group. But prospective students dropping in to check out Northeastern\u2019s new digs mostly had to imagine it. The classrooms are still virtual, as in still under construction. \u201cI\u2019m the new dean of a campus that doesn\u2019t exist yet,\u201d Mr. Washburn said in welcoming the attendees as they munched on sandwiches.",

The ads begin Monday as part of an aggressive recent push by the bookstore chain to gain e-reader market share in Britain. The company, which already has agreements to sell its e-readers through supermarket chains like Sainsbury, Dixons and Waitrose, also announced a new partnership with Asda, another supermarket chain. The e-readers will be available in 300 of Asda's stores as well as on its Web site. Currently the company says it has products in 1,600 retail outlets in Britain and will expand to more than 2,500 in the coming months. Barnes & Noble is struggling to position its Nook against competitors like the Amazon Kindle and Apple iPad. In Britain it is promoting its e-ink devices like the Nook Simple Touch and the Nook Simple Touch GlowLight, which has a built-in reading light. The campaign in Britain includes print and online ads as well as 30-second television spots, and focuses on couples in which one partner is trying to sleep and the other is keeping a light on for reading. Barnes & Noble says its research shows that this is a common source of bedtime arguments. \"This is a common clash between couples at bedtime,'' said Patrick Rouvillois, international managing director for Nook Media L.L.C., a Barnes & Noble subsidiary, in a written statement. \"Our new campaign sheds light on this age-old issue and celebrates its resolution with Nook Simple Touch GlowLight.'' In August, Barnes & Noble announced that in the quarter that ended July 28, sales for its Nook business were flat over the previous year, at $192 million.

        "content": " If  Amazon   were an ordinary company, investors would long ago have strapped its management to a rocket ship and sent it far, far away. Amazon  said Thursday   that it lost money in the third quarter, continuing a trend of unimpressive earnings reports for the retailer. Similar disappointments are causing carnage at some of Amazon\u2019s land-based electronics competitors. But Amazon\u2019s many fans seemed largely unfazed. The earnings report, released after the market closed, sent Amazon shares down as much as 9 percent in after-hours trading, but they quickly recovered. The stock hit a record high earlier this year, and it trades at an astronomical price/earnings multiple. What separates Amazon from the competition is that it is not trying to make money. It is instead trying to grow as fast as it can, something it has been doing successfully for 15 years. What was once a cute start-up is now one of the country\u2019s biggest retailers. Third-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, a little less than the $13.9 billion that analysts expected but up 27 percent from 2011. Despite all those customers snapping up Kindles and \u201c50 Shades of Grey,\u201d the company had warned that a loss was coming. Amazon said it lost 60 cents a share in the third quarter, but more than half of that was from its investment in the daily deals site Living Social. The consensus estimate was a loss of 8 cents. Amazon earned 14 cents a share in the third quarter of 2011. In a conference call with analysts, Tom Szkutak, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, declined as usual to shed much light on the company\u2019s plans. With regard to the persistent rumor that Amazon will open some pop-up stores during the holidays to sell Kindle devices, for instance, he said that the company\u2019s current practice of selling through other retailers is \u201cnot really a driver of our business.\u201d Amazon\u2019s strategy of selling as cheaply as it can may be tough on its margins but it is tougher on competitors. Radio Shack missed its earnings forecasts this week, prompting doubts about its viability. The specialty home appliance and electronics retailer H. H. Gregg, which operates 200 stores in the Midwest and Southeast, saw its shares drop 13 percent Thursday. Shares of Best Buy fell 10 percent as the store warned that third-quarter profit would be \u201csignificantly lower.\u201d \u201cAmazon is having a major impact on a number of businesses,\u201d said Jason Moser, who covers Amazon for the Motley Fool investment site and owns shares in the retailer. \u201cWe know that chief executive Jeff Bezos is quite patient and has plenty of financial resources. It appears his strategy is working. The third-quarter loss was modest and the long-term implications here are as strong as ever. My faith isn\u2019t dented in the least.\u201d There are Amazon skeptics. Colin Gillis of BGC Partners published a haiku before the earnings report: \u201cSo much revenue, and with all those shipping costs, so little profit.\u201d What his verse lacked in poetry it made up in cogent criticism. Amazon\u2019s operating margins have been about 2 percent or less for the last year. \u201cAmazon has the lowest operating margin and the highest valuation in our technology company coverage,\u201d Mr. Gillis wrote, adding that \u201cthe company is not likely to achieve material leverage off its revenue growth as costs associated with investments into its digital platforms build.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cthe nature of Amazon\u2019s core business is that of a discount retailer, which limits margin upside.\u201d In the second quarter, the analyst noted, Amazon increased revenues by $2.9 billion but income from operations declined by $95 million to $107 million. The third quarter is mere preamble to the fourth quarter, where Wall Street expects significant revenue growth powered by new Kindle tablets and associated downloads.  New warehouses are coming , bringing physical goods to customers so quickly that they will, in theory and no doubt in practice, order more. Asked about same-day delivery, Mr. Szkutak said on the conference call that the warehouses have \u201chelped improve our delivery speed to customers.\u201d He added, \u201cWhat I would expect moving forward would be more of the same.\u201d",

        "content": " Google is now in the same-day delivery business. In San Francisco, some people affiliated with Google can buy a product, using their phones or computers, and have it delivered to their homes in a matter of hours. Plans for the new service  have been under way   for more than a year. But it recently went live for some Google employees and their friends, according to two people briefed on the service who were not authorized to discuss it because Google has not yet publicly introduced it. At least one national apparel chain is involved, one of these people said. A Google spokesman, Nate Tyler, declined to comment. Google is just one company tackling same-day delivery.  So are Wal-Mart Stores ,  Amazon.com ,  eBay   and the United States Postal Service. Though the service propels Google into commerce, the company does not intend to operate warehouses or a shipping service but to team up with retailers and delivery companies. Several San Francisco retailers, including national chains, are participating in the program already. For shoppers, the service means they can avoid the trouble of driving to the store and some of the wait for items ordered online. Same-day delivery could help physical retailers, which have been under siege from e-commerce companies that offer the convenience of shopping without leaving home. But online retailers offering same-day delivery could make life even harder for physical retailers, because letting people own something the same day has become physical retailers' biggest remaining advantage. The reasons that Google is interested in same-day delivery are less obvious. Retail ads are a huge portion of Google's business, but they are under threat from companies like Amazon, where shoppers increasingly go to search for products, bypassing Google. Also  responding to the threat   from Amazon, Google recently tried to improve its comparison shopping service by charging retailers to list their products there. It says retailers are more likely to list accurate and up-to-date items if they are paying. Additionally, Google has been trying to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds to better understand and profit from mobile ads. On computers, Google and advertisers know if a user clicks on an ad and visits or buys on another Web site. But they lose track of customers who look up a business or product on their phone and then put their phone away, walk into the store and buy something. Online ordering and delivery could help solve that problem.

The company said the higher costs of making its revamped product line would eat into profit for that quarter.

To put that in perspective, Apple's revenue for the year exceeded that of Microsoft, Google and Facebook combined.

        "content": " LONDON - A campaign to boycott big multinationals accused of dodging British taxes is posing some tough ethical dilemmas for the country's fair-minded consumers. A Facebook friend reports that he is prepared to forgo his daily skinny latte from Starbucks, which is reported to have  paid no tax in Britain since 2009 . But he is reluctant to give up his account with the social media giant, whose local unit, Facebook UK,  is said to have paid the equivalent of just $383,000   last year after earning $282 million. A range of household name multinationals, which also includes the Internet giants  Google, Amazon, Apple and   eBay , has been sucked into a growing controversy that has led to  accusations from members of Parliament   that big business is gaming the taxman at a time when ordinary people are being forced to tighten their belts. As two parliamentary committees prepared to question tax officials about the case of the Seattle-based Starbucks, Prime Minister David Cameron said this week he was  unhappy about the level of tax avoidance   among big corporations operating in Britain. \"We do need to make sure we are encouraging these businesses to invest in our country, as they are, but they should be paying fair taxes as well,\" he told the House of Commons. The companies named in a series of media investigations have responded that they are doing nothing more than utilizing ingenious and quite legal tax avoidance methods to reduce their fiscal bills. The unwelcome publicity has nevertheless spurred activists such as the grassroots  UK Uncut   that have targeted alleged corporate greed in a time of austerity and budget cuts. The pressure group has said companies such as Starbucks were in its sights for future protests. \"UK Uncut's previous sit-ins and occupations in the branches of tax dodgers have proved very effective in highlighting the unjust practices of big business,\" Anna Walker, a spokesperson for the group,  told the Guardian . The companies named have come out fighting. Troy Alstead, Starbucks' chief financial officer, expressed his anger about misrepresentation of the company's tax situation. He  told the Financial Times   this week that a quarter of the company's 600 British-owned stores were running at a loss and said its low corporate tax payments reflected mistakes of overexpansion. \"I look forward to the day when we pay a lot more tax,\" he said. Mr. Alstead acknowledged that royalty payments to Starbucks regional headquarters in the Netherlands reduced the British unit's taxable income but the practice was comparable to other multinational retailers with overseas headquarters. EBay, the online auction site, meanwhile reacted to reports that it paid the equivalent of $1.2 million to the taxman in 2010 when its British sales were worth $1.3 billion by  telling the BBC : \"EBay in Europe works with tax authorities and complies fully with all applicable tax laws and regimes.\" Mr. Cameron noted this week that tax avoidance by multinationals was a global problem. But, as the Daily Telegraph's Damian Reece argued, it was one that had become more complex in the age of the Internet. \"In the age of cloud computing, things get even more complicated as corporation tax is applied using the principle of where a company's decision makers are based,\"  he wrote . \"It's hard to tax things happening in cyberspace.\" In Latest Extradition Battle, a Victory for British  Hacker French Scallop War Roils English  Channel Self-Interest Leads to Collapse of BAE-EADS  Merger Will Britain's Rivalries Harm  Governance?

        "name": "Random House and Penguin Are Negotiating a Merger ",
        "content": " In an effort to stave off the challenge from online retailers in a rapidly changing market, two of the world's largest book publishers,  Random House   and Penguin, are engaged in talks to combine their businesses. Pearson , the British media conglomerate that owns Penguin, said Thursday that it was discussing a potential deal with Random House's owner,  Bertelsmann   of Germany. The merger, if completed, would create a combined entity that would control nearly 25 percent of the United States book market and feature an elite roster of authors like  Dan Brown ,  Toni Morrison   and  John Grisham   of Random House and Junot Diaz and  Patricia Cornwell   of Penguin. The potential consolidation comes as traditional publishers try to compete with dominant technology companies like  Amazon ,  Apple   and  Google   that have gained power in the e-book market. Lower prices offered by retailers like Amazon have put pressure on publishers to adjust their digital book strategy at a time when brick-and-mortar stores have been disappearing. A deal could signal a move toward further consolidation among the major publishers, much the way the music industry realigned itself as it made the painful transition to the digital marketplace. Facing intense competition from Apple's iTunes, the industry shrunk from six major record companies to three. A merger of Random House and Penguin could help the publishing houses cut costs by combining resources, and it would give them more heft in negotiations with Amazon and Apple as readers increasingly abandon print for cheaper e-books. Penguin Group USA is among the five major publishers named in a lawsuit filed last spring by the Justice Department, which accused those publishers and Apple of colluding in the pricing of e-books. Three publishers - Hachette Book Group, Simon & Schuster and HarperCollins - settled. Penguin and Macmillan have not. Random House, the largest book publisher in the United States, was not named in the lawsuit. \"A combined Random House and Penguin would be a supplier so large it would be very difficult for any anyone to dictate terms to,\" said Mike Shatzkin, the founder and chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a consultant to publishers. He added: \"You're allowed to collude if you're combined.\" But for authors and their representatives, news of the merger discussions, first reported by Germany's Manager Magazin, came as another potential blow in an already challenging profession. Several literary agents said a merger would lead to a consolidation of publishing imprints, thus reducing the number of bidders vying for titles. They also said that combining editing and marketing resources would likely lead to layoffs and potentially put added pressure on authors, especially those who do not churn out mass-market hits. David Kuhn, a literary agent in New York, said that a shrinking book industry could be compared to the situation in Hollywood, where studios under financial pressure now focus on churning out a handful of blockbusters a year, rather than taking risks on smaller films. \"If there are 20 fewer imprints, then that means there are 20 fewer publishers with checkbooks willing to make bets on less known entities,\" Mr. Kuhn said. Another New York agent, who insisted on anonymity to candidly discuss the deal, was more pessimistic. \"This group would be HUGE. NOT good for authors,\" the agent wrote in an e-mail James L. McQuivey, a media analyst at  Forrester Research , said the early panic was justified. \"Agents should be terrified because it would give them even fewer people to play against each other,\" he said. But, he added, the consolidation of some of the remaining \"big six\" publishing houses is inevitable. \"The need to get some kind of grip on the future of book publishing is driving every single one of these top six publishers in often unconventional ways,\" Mr. McQuivey said. A deal between Random House and Penguin would be subject to government approval. Regulators in Europe have demanded significant divestitures as a condition for approval of another recent cultural acquisition, the purchase of EMI by the French media company Vivendi. In the United States, Mr. McQuivey said, regulators could take other factors into account. \"They're facing a much bigger threat in Amazon than considering it might restrain competition,\" Mr. McQuivey said of the potential merger. Although financial details remain preliminary, Bertelsmann is expected to have an ownership stake of more than 50 percent in Penguin, according to a person briefed on the talks, who was not authorized to discuss the conversations publicly. In 1998 Bertelsmann paid more than $1 billion to acquire Random House, which now includes 200 editorially independent imprints that publish around 10,000 books a year. In 2011 the publishing house reported revenue of $2.26 billion, a 4.6 percent decline from a year earlier. In the first half of 2012 Random House reported a 64 percent increase in operating profit, largely because of the success of the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" trilogy. Penguin, which publishes about 4,000 books annually, had $1.61 billion in revenue in 2011, a 4 percent decrease from the previous year. Revenue from e-books accounted for 12 percent of Penguin's global revenues in 2011, up from 6 percent in 2010, according to Pearson. For Pearson, based in London, unloading part of its struggling publishing business at a premium could help it focus on its faster growing education business. Earlier this month, Pearson's longtime chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, said she planned to step down at the end of the year, prompting speculation that the company would eventually sell its publishing units, Penguin and The Financial Times. A Bertelsmann spokeswoman, Susanne Erdl, declined to comment. In a statement Pearson confirmed the talks, adding that \"the two companies have not reached agreement and there is no certainty the discussions will lead to a transaction.\" Analysts said Thomas Rabe, the chief executive of Bertelsmann, based in G\u00fcttersloh, Germany, is under pressure to make a deal because some of the company's existing businesses are slowing, with no clear plans for growth in the digital era. Mr. Rabe took over about a year ago from Hartmut Ostrowski, who was seen as more of a caretaker, and immediately announced plans to transform Bertelsmann.

        "content": " Some services at Amazon.com's data centers went down Monday afternoon, taking with them a number of popular Web sites and services, including Flipboard and Foursquare. Amazon reported problems at data centers in Northern Virginia that appeared to have had a ripple effect across the Internet, as many companies depend on the company's cloud service to run their businesses. Several frustrated customers took to Twitter to complain. In June, an electrical storm caused problems at the same Northern Virginia data centers and took down sites including Netflix, Pinterest and Instagram for a weekend. The companies that were affected by the latest shutdown scrambled to respond. \"Like many other services, we've been taken down by the outage,\" said Erin Gleason, a spokeswoman for Foursquare, the mobile check-in service. \"Both the site and the app are inaccessible right now.\" Ms. Gleason said the company was still awaiting information from Amazon about when its service might be restored. Another start-up, Airbnb, attempted to reassure its members via Twitter. \"Apologies. Our site is having a case of the Mondays,\" the company posted. Tera Randall, a representative for Amazon, said in an e-mail that the problems only involved one zone of the company's service and were affecting \"a portion of customers in that zone.\" She declined to elaborate on when service might be restored or what percentage of the company's overall cloud computing business was involved. A status message on Amazon's Web site said that the company's cluster of cloud computing services in Virginia were \"currently experiencing degraded performance.\" By late evening, at least one service that suffered as a result of the shutdown, Pinterest, showed signs of coming back to life. \"The site issues we were experiencing should be resolved and you can pin to your heart's content again,\" the company wrote on Twitter. \"Thanks again for your understanding!\"",

        "name": "How Are 7-Inch Tablets Doing? ",
        "content": " Apple is widely expected to introduce a  smaller, cheaper version of its iPad   on Tuesday, perhaps in response to the crop of 7-inch tablets that have popped up in the last year. But how are those tablets even doing anyway? It turns out that the number of seven-inch tablets sold by each of Apple's major competitors is small compared to the number of iPads it has sold. To date, Apple has sold about 84 million iPads. Amazon's Kindle Fire, the second-best-selling tablet, has sold about seven million units; Barnes and Noble has sold about five million Nook tablets; and Google has sold about three million Nexus 7 tablets, according to estimates by Forrester. That's about 15 million tablets across three companies. And while no single company presents a major threat to Apple yet, it's not a number to sneeze at - after all, that's 15 million more iPads that Apple could have sold. So it makes sense that the company is preparing its own smaller tablet at a lower price, said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester analyst. \"Apple is smart to be acting before it gets to be more of a problem,\" she said. Steve Jobs once dismissed seven-inch tablets , saying they were \"tweeners\" that were too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with an iPad. Several sources have said Apple's smaller iPad will be 7.85 inches, which is a bit bigger than 7 inches but might still be considered a \"tweener.\" Would these sell nearly as well as the current iPad? Stephen Baker, an analyst with the NPD Group, thinks smaller tablets are a viable category because they cater to people who don't want to spend too much money on a tablet, or those who just want something smaller to carry with them everywhere. Ms. Rotman Epps agreed. She said a 7.85-inch iPad could also broaden the product's appeal to women because it would most likely fit in a purse.

        "name": "EBay\u2019s Focus on Mobile Apps Helps Lift Revenue 15% ",
        "content": " SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Quarter by quarter,  eBay   defies the conventional wisdom that troubled Internet companies can never return to their former glory. The once troubled online retailer has continued a successful turnaround and cultivated double-digit growth in PayPal, its online payments system. Just three years ago, eBay\u2019s core auction business had stalled and its stock price was down to $10, a far cry from its peak of $58 in 2004. At today\u2019s closing price of $48.20, the company\u2019s stock is up 54 percent for the year, more than the 37 percent gain of its rival Amazon. \u201cThat\u2019s a significant run,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst with the brokerage firm BCG Partners. \u201cThe core story behind eBay is that they are doing all the right things.\u201d Results were  strong again in the third quarter . On Wednesday, eBay reported that net income rose $597 million or 45 cents a share, a 22 percent jump from the quarter a year earlier. Revenue climbed 15 percent to $3.4 billion. John J. Donahoe, eBay\u2019s chief executive, attributed the company\u2019s performance in part to an early bet that mobile phones would become a platform for commerce, with PayPal providing a lead in mobile payments. \u201cWe\u2019re the largest mobile commerce and payments provider in the world,\u201d Mr. Donahoe said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cAnd we are continuing to innovate. We have a series of innovative apps that people are using. People love shopping on their smartphones and iPad, and PayPal is still the safest way to pay on a mobile phone.\u201d EBay\u2019s mobile apps have been downloaded more than 100 million times worldwide. EBay sellers are now posting two million items a week from their smartphones and, last quarter, over 800,000 new users made their first eBay purchase from a smartphone. Marketplaces, eBay\u2019s biggest business, brought in $1.8 billion in revenue last quarter, up 9 percent from a year ago. PayPal \u2014 which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion 10 years ago \u2014 brought in $1.37 billion in revenue last quarter, a 23 percent jump from the same quarter a year ago, and it is expected to surpass Marketplaces in revenue. \u201cIf you do the math, that will be three to five years out if current trends continue,\u201d Mr. Donahoe said. The company, based in San Jose, Calif., expects each business to achieve $10 billion in volume in 2012, more than double the volume in 2011. The operating profit margin increased to 19.6 percent from 18.1 percent in the same period last year. EBay is now experimenting with a new mobile app called eBay Now. The app, which is being tested by consumers in San Francisco, allows eBay customers to buy products \u2014 from their phones \u2014 from Macy\u2019s, Target and Walgreens, and have them delivered the same day. \u201cWhat our research says is that consumers like choice,\u201d Mr. Donahoe said. \u201cPeople may want an item to come to their office that day, their house the following day and get other items in a couple days. We\u2019re giving them that choice.\u201d If its experiment is successful, eBay Now could mount a challenge to Amazon\u2019s shipping service, Amazon Prime, a program that offers customers unlimited free two-day shipping on millions of items for $79 a year. Increasingly, fast delivery is shaping up as the new battleground for online merchants. But strong performance also breeds high expectations. Last quarter, analysts scrambled to raise their estimates after the company reported a 144 percent jump in profit from a year earlier. The third quarter\u2019s 15 percent revenue increase, while impressive, was just below the $3.41 billion that Wall Street analysts had expected. The company\u2019s stock dipped slightly in after-hours trading after eBay guided analysts to trim their estimates for the fourth quarter. EBay said it expects to earn 66 cents to 69 cents a share during the holiday season; the consensus of analysts had been 68 cents. Asked whether the company would have a hard time meeting analysts expectations in quarters to come, Mr. Donahoe said: \u201cOur momentum continues, even in the face of reasonable economic uncertainty.\u201d",

        "content": " As the days tick down to Microsoft's introduction of its Surface tablet, the company has revealed how it plans to price the product - more like Apple than Amazon. Instead of adopting Amazon's lower pricing on the Kindle Fire, Microsoft said it would sell Surface for a starting price of $500, the same starting price as the current generation of Apple's iPad. People who buy that Surface model will get some extra perks though, including 32 gigabytes of storage - twice the amount of the cheapest third-generation iPad - and a 10.6-inch display, rather than the iPad's 9.7-inch display. Microsoft said it would sell a 32-gigabyte Surface bundled with a black  Touch Cover , a keyboard that doubles as a protective shield for the tablet, for $600. A similar bundle with a 64-gigabyte Surface will cost $700. Microsoft will sell Touch Covers separately in a wider assortment of colors for $120, and a different type of keyboard cover with moving keys, called Type Cover, will sell for $130. It's clear Microsoft is aiming Surface at what is shaping up to be the premium portion of the tablet market, which Apple currently dominates. Amazon, in contrast, seems intent on using price as a weapon to gain market share against its rivals. The company recently introduced an 8.9-inch-screen Kindle Fire that starts at $300. Microsoft has not yet said whether it will bring out a version of Surface that competes in the small-screen tablet category. Google's Nexus 7 tablet starts at $200, while Amazon's seven-inch Kindle Fire starts at $160. Apple is  expected   to announce a new, smaller iPad next week. Surface will go on sale Oct. 26 in Microsoft retail stores in the United States and Canada. The company said the product would be sold online in Britain, China, France, Germany and several other countries. Microsoft said a limited quantity will be available for ordering on Tuesday at noon Eastern time. The company also began showing a  new Surface television commercial   on Monday evening, featuring an odd collection of foot-stomping girls in school uniforms and dancers using their Surface tablets as percussion instruments.

        "name": "Same-Day Delivery Test at Wal-Mart ",
        "content": " Wal-Mart Stores kicked Amazon out   of its 4,000 stores last month when it discontinued Kindle tablets and e-readers. Now, the retailer is poised to use those stores against its online rival once again \u2014 this time aiming for the heart of Amazon\u2019s retail model. Wal-Mart said Tuesday it had begun  testing same-day delivery   for online purchases in a handful of cities across the country. The near-instant delivery is possible because the merchandise is being shipped from Walmart stores. The first retailer to master same-day delivery on a wide scale could attract customers who have avoided online purchases because they wanted items immediately, and encourage current shoppers to add products that they usually buy from supermarkets or drugstores, including celery and toothpaste. But some retail analysts are questioning whether the expense and difficulty of same-day delivery would be worth it. Amazon is the world\u2019s largest online retailer, and  in an interview last month   , Jeff Bezos, its chief executive, said that the company was striving for same-day delivery in metropolitan areas. Its Web site says same-day delivery is available in limited cases. Mr. Bezos said Amazon would soon be able to cut as much as a day off its shipping times, raising the possibility of same-day delivery in cities where it has distribution centers. If Wal-Mart expanded its same-day shipping across the country, it could essentially transform the more than 4,000 Walmarts, along with Sam\u2019s Club and other divisions, into distribution centers. Amazon, by contrast, had fewer than 40 distribution centers in the United States at the end of last year and has plans to add about 20 worldwide this year. \u201cEverybody in retail is terrified of Amazon, and they\u2019re terrified of losing more wallet share to Amazon,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research. The Wal-Mart move is \u201cto try to get ahead of the curve if Amazon does introduce something like this.\u201d Wal-Mart and Amazon once operated in separate spheres \u2014 Wal-Mart\u2019s offline, Amazon\u2019s online. And Amazon\u2019s sales, at $48 billion in 2011, are more than a tenth of Wal-Mart\u2019s, which were $419 billion in 2011. But increasingly, they are competing for the same customer and the same turf. For instance, in a move that probably hurt Wal-Mart, Amazon last year offered customers a discount on items they scanned in physical stores, letting it pluck shoppers as they strolled the aisles of stores like Walmart. And its subscription Prime service, offering free two-day delivery on many items, has gotten customers buying staples like toilet paper from it rather than from nearby groceries and Walmarts. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has been building up its e-commerce site as it tries to do things that Amazon cannot, such as allowing customers to  pay for online purchases with cash   . \u201cConnecting our Web site to our stores gives us a unique advantage, so customers can shop anytime, anywhere,\u201d said Amy Lester, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. Both retailers have the same goal: to be the general store where customers will buy apparel, food, home d\u00e9cor and just about everything else, no matter how they want to order and receive the goods. Yet same-day delivery may not make financial sense, Ms. Mulpuru said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t care about losing a lot of money, sure, you can pull this off,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is: Can you pull this off profitably? I\u2019m not convinced.\u201d She pointed to retailers that already offer same-day delivery in some areas, like Barnes & Noble, and said that the service had not been a game-changer. People who live in dense urban areas and who do not have cars might find same-day delivery useful, but for those in suburban or rural areas a short drive to a Walmart is easier than waiting for a delivery, she said. Physical retailers have been trying to figure out how to turn their stores into competitive advantages. With staff, inventory and real estate, stores have many costs that online retailers do not have. Wal-Mart and a few others have started using the stores to  offer services to online shoppers   , including shipping items (but not same-day), free returns, ordering online and picking up in a store and payment centers. However, few offline retailers offer same-day delivery. They rarely have enough locations to make it feasible, and there are logistical hurdles. The Wal-Mart tests, the first of which started last week in the Washington suburbs, let customers order toys and other popular gifts, and have them delivered to their homes the same day. Ms. Lester, the Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the company chose which items to include based on what was popular in its order-online, pick-up-in-store service. The same-day service costs $10, with no minimum purchase. Wal-Mart has been testing same-day grocery delivery for more than two years in San Jose, Calif., and now offers it in San Francisco, too. But this is the first time it is trying to ship general merchandise within a day. To receive goods on the same day, consumers must place an order before noon, and select a four-hour window when they want the items delivered. United Parcel Service is handling deliveries. The current test includes toys, sports equipment, home d\u00e9cor and electronics \u2014 all popular holiday items. Amazon has offered limited items   , in limited areas, for same-day delivery since 2009, its Web site says. Its Prime service, which costs $79 a year, is popular. \u201cPrime members buy at a faster rate in all categories,\u201d Mr. Bezos said this year. \u201cOne of the big advantages of Amazon for consumers is that they can get one box with a lot of things in it from different categories.\u201d The Wal-Mart program is already running in Northern Virginia and Philadelphia. It was introduced Tuesday in Minneapolis, and the San Jose and San Francisco areas that are already part of the grocery test will join the toys-and-gifts test this fall. \u201cThis is definitely a holiday test, but we don\u2019t have an end date at this point,\u201d Ms. Lester said. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.",

        "name": "With Steve Jobs Tribute, a Home Page Reflects Apple's Founder Again ",
        "content": " On most days, Apple.com is like any other corporate home page -- a billboard, a news hub for corporate goings-on and a launching pad for an online store where people can buy stuff. Every once in a while, though, it turns into something unlike any other big company's home page. Friday was one such day, when Apple's home page featured a video tribute to Steven P. Jobs, the company's co-founder and former chief executive who died a year ago to the day. The 105-second video consisted of still black-and-white images of Mr. Jobs with audio of him announcing Apple products like the iPhone and describing Apple's corporate philosophy. The music on the soundtrack is Bach's Prelude No. 1 in G Major for Cello, played by Yo-Yo Ma, who was a friend of Mr. Jobs. The home page take-over made it modestly more difficult for Apple customers, most of whom were probably unaware that Friday was the anniversary of Mr. Jobs's death, to buy Apple products. After the video finished playing and a letter from Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, appeared, regular links to Apple's online store and product pages were displayed. Apple isn't alone in using the platinum online real estate of its home page to make a big statement with its customers. Amazon, for instance, periodically wipes all of the normal product pitches from its front door to replace them with letters from its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, including  one   in July about an education and training program to help Amazon workers improve their skills. Under Mr. Jobs though, Apple's home page occasionally became a showcase for events and people that had very little to do with Apple's business. In 2007, after Al Gore, the former vice president and an Apple board member, won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work bringing attention to climate change, Apple devoted most of its home page to celebrating the event. \"We are bursting with pride for Al and this historic recognition of his global contributions,\" a message on the page said. When people that Mr. Jobs admired died, Apple.com was made over in similar fashion. That happened when  George Harrison   of the Beatles and  Rosa Parks , the civil rights activist who was featured in Apple's \"Think Different\" advertising campaign, passed away. All of the tributes bore the unmistakable imprint of Mr. Jobs, without whose approval such radical changes to the Apple home page would have been unthinkable. Even after his death, his influence on the site still shows.

        "name": "Daily Report: Google Deal Gives Publishers a Choice to Digitize or Not ",
        "content": " After seven years of litigation, Google and book publishers said on Thursday that they had reached a settlement to allow publishers to choose whether Google digitizes their books and journals,  reports Claire Cain Miller in   Friday's New York Times. It was a small step forward for Google's plan to digitize every book and make them readable and searchable online, known as the Google Library Project, but it did not resolve the much bigger issue standing in Google's way - litigation between Google and authors. Though the settlement will not change much about the way that Google and publishers already partner, it is the newest signpost for defining copyright in the Internet age. It is also the latest evidence of the shift to e-books from print, and of Google's efforts to compete with e-book rivals like Amazon.com. Digital books were a new and daunting prospect when the publishers first sued Google seven years ago, but they have now become commonplace. The publishers involved in the settlement are the McGraw-Hill Companies, Pearson Education, the Penguin Group, John Wiley & Sons and Simon & Schuster. The deal allows the publishers to choose whether to allow Google to digitize their out-of-print books that are still under copyright protection. If Google does so, it will allow people to read 20 percent of the books online and purchase the entire books from the Google Play store. It will share revenue with the publishers, but the precise financial terms were not disclosed. Google has been offering publishers the opportunity to sell digital books for years, and digitizing new books has become routine for publishers. But under the settlement, publishers get the benefit of Google digitizing out-of-print books that they might not otherwise have turned into e-books. Meanwhile, Google can expand the library of e-books it sells to consumers.

        "content": " It must be great to be an architecture critic. You write about a building once, and your review remains basically fresh forever. When you're a tech critic, though, the state of the art changes monthly, if not hourly. You toil over writing a masterpiece, and it winds up having the shelf life of milk. It could be worse. Instead of writing about gadgets, you could be stuck with an even worse treadmill job: making them. Pity, for example, the poor slobs at Amazon and Barnes & Noble, locked in an endless battle for e-reader supremacy. They play an annual game of leapfrog that would exhaust frogs. ''I see your new color tablet,'' says Barnes & Noble's Nook team, ''and I raise you one higher-resolution screen!'' ''Oh, yeah?'' says Amazon's Kindle team. ''Well, you know the Nook with a self-illuminated screen that you introduced in April? We have one with a better backlight. Take that!'' That's a real example. There are two kinds of e-book gadgets. There are those with E Ink screens (cheap, light, thin, no color, long battery life, great to read in bright sunlight, useless in the dark). And there are those with color screens (heavier, thicker, pricier, great to read in low light, tough to read in sunlight). People who opt for E Ink rave about the ''printed'' look of the black text on a light gray ''page.'' They can also be found spending $60 on a case that contains a tiny flip-up flashlight -- or just carrying one around on a keychain -- so that they can read in bed or in other darkish situations. E Ink is so much like paper, it doesn't light up on its own. In April, Barnes & Noble changed the game: it offered an E Ink e-reader whose background lights up with a soft glow, like a digital watch. With the introduction of that model -- the efficiently named Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight -- the company hacked off one enormous item on the list of E Ink drawbacks. Not only is reading in bed practical, it's actually superior to reading an actual book, since the gentle glowing screen is nowhere near bright enough to keep a sleeping partner awake. Your move, Kindle. Amazon's response to the B&NNSTGL (now $120) is the new Kindle Paperwhite (same price). The headline here is that the Paperwhite's lighting is better than the Nook's. At top brightness, it's much brighter. More usefully, its lighting is far more even than the Nook's, whose edge-mounted lamps can create subtle ''hot spots'' at the top and bottom of the page, sometimes spilling out from there. How much unevenness depends on how high you've turned up the light. But in the hot spots, the black letters of the text show less contrast. The Kindle Paperwhite has hot spots, too, but only at the bottom edge, where the four low-power LED bulbs sit. (Amazon says that from there, the light is pumped out across the screen through a flattened fiber optic cable.) In the middle of the page, where the text is, the lighting is perfectly even: no low-contrast text areas. The Kindle's screen also packs in 212 tiny dots an inch, compared with the Nook's 167, for visibly sharper text. Both models have touch screens, which is a real joy; you can tap lightly to turn the page or bring up a panel that controls type size, font choice, margins and line spacing. But on the Kindle's screen, you can use two fingers. That's primarily useful when you want to adjust the type size (most of us will, in fact, be over 40 at some point); you can just spread two fingers apart, as on an iPad, without having to open some settings screen. When viewed side-by-side with the Nook GlowLight, the Paperwhite is much more comfortable to read. You could argue that that's an important factor in a reading tablet. The Kindle Paperwhite and Nook are about the same height (4.6 inches), but the Kindle is 0.4 inch narrower and slightly thinner. Thin is great -- you can cradle the entire thing in one hand; on the other hand, the Nook's soft-touch back panel has a gentle sculptured ridge that makes one-handed holding comfortable and secure. All right, the Paperwhite has superior lighting and sharpness. The Nook, however, has some persuasive counterarguments of its own -- starting with the value. Both readers may seem to cost $120, but for that money, Barnes & Noble includes a wall charger. (The Kindle charges only from the USB jack on a computer, unless you spring $10 more for the charger.) The Kindle displays ads. They appear on the screen saver and across the bottom of the Home screen. Now, those ads -- commonplace in the Kindle line -- are a brazen move by Amazon. You might think that it's obnoxious for Amazon to advertise on a gadget you own. You'd think that your personal property would be exempt from commercial intrusions; it would be like finding ads on your car's dashboard or your phone's Home screen. In practice, however, most Kindlers don't seem to mind. You can pay $20 extra to have them removed, but few people bother. The ads are fairly subtle, they appear only in places where you don't spend much time, and $20 is $20. Still, the Nook never puts ads on your screen. The Nook has a half-ounce weight advantage, which is important in a gadget that you hold all the time. It also has physical, clicking page-turn buttons on each side of the screen, which accounts for its extra width. The Nook also has a memory-card slot for more storage. The Kindle offers two gigabytes of storage, which the company says is enough for more than 1,000 books, so running out of room isn't a knuckle-biting concern. Besides, you get unlimited storage on Amazon.com for anything you've bought from its e-book store; you can re-download any book when you need it. (Especially if you've sprung an extra $60 for the cellular version, which gets you online wherever you are -- no charge.) But if you're a candidate for the next mission to Alpha Centauri, it's good to know that the Nook is ready for a bigger library. You can turn off the backlighting on the Nook, too. On the Kindle, it's on all the time. You can turn it way down low, but not off. Amazon's rationale is that the light imposes no battery-life penalty, so why not simplify life and have it on all the time? Even with the light on, the Kindle lasts eight weeks of reading 30 minutes a day (with Wi-Fi off); that's twice as long as the Nook with the same settings. You have a dizzying number of options in e-readers these days. You can go with an iPad ($500 and up, gorgeous, big, heavy, almost as useful as a laptop). You could get a $200 color touch-screen reader (Kindle HD, Google's Nexus 7 or the coming Nook HD), which offers great reading and movie viewing, and a few apps. But if what you mostly want to do is read, a self-illuminating E Ink reader still sits at the sweetest spot on the price-weight-size-beach-bedroom matrix. Both of these light-up readers are backed by e-bookstores that would raise the Library of Congress's eyebrows. Both are oozing with features -- annotations, dictionary definitions and so on. The glowy Nook has more hardware features and a better price. But if you're choosing an E Ink reader over the color models, it's because what you intend to do mostly is stare at that screen, lost in your reading. In that case, the display of the page is more important than any other factor, and that's where the Kindle Paperwhite shines.
