It is a trend that many colleges and universities have embraced in recent years — remote campuses to extend the brand and the flow of tuition checks.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But there was more going on here. And all the new dean, J. Tayloe Washburn, had to do to demonstrate that was walk to the bank of windows in the meeting room where the prospects and the staff had congregated and throw wide his arms: the headquarters buildings of the tech giant Amazon.com filled the view under a gray Seattle mist.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We’re very aware we’ll be sitting across the street from 12,000 Amazon workers,” said Mr. Washburn, a prominent Seattle lawyer and former chairman of the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Remember the notion that technology would destroy the idea of place, creating work forces of telecommuters and disembodied companies — or universities, for that matter — that were no longer anchored anywhere because they did not have to be? Turns out to have been entirely wrong, say Northeastern officials, who are enthused over what they see as a post-recession technology boom in the making in places like Seattle, and one where postgraduate science and technology workers are in particularly short supply</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Being where the action is, with a smile and shoeshine and the reputation of a 114-year-old research university to back it all up, they say, is more important than ever. Starting in January, Northeastern will offer online</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">graduate-level courses here, taught by instructors back East, alongside real classroom courses in a Seattle neighborhood called South Lake Union, once more known for warehouses than Wi-Fi. In recent years, a cluster of health science research and computer science companies have also gathered to rub shoulders with Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“You have to be present on the ground, you have to understand the community, you have to become part of the community,” Northeastern’s president, Joseph E. Aoun, said in a telephone interview. A reliance on remote learning alone does not, he said, build relationships, a word he used repeatedly. “It’s mutually reinforcing — the virtual is going to lead you to have the need for a physical presence and physical contact,” he said, “and the physical contact is being supplemented by the virtual dimensions.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Economists and urban affairs experts say that in a strange way, the Great Recession intensified the concentration of technology workers here that Northeastern is aiming for. Industries like finance and construction, which had been big local job generators before the crash, fell away sharply, but Seattle-area stalwarts like Amazon, Boeing and Microsoft continued to grow, or at least hold stable.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/education/2018144362_tuition05m.html" class="s1" target="_blank">At the same time, the University of Washington — the dominant higher education institution in Seattle, and also a neighbor to Amazon — got battered by years of deep budget cuts and </a><a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/education/2018144362_tuition05m.html" class="a" target="_blank">tuition increases</a> <span style=" color: #000;">during the recession, as did many other public universities across the nation.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What the recession did is it froze a lot of people in place,” said Margaret O’Mara, an associate professor at the University of Washington who teaches American urban history and has written widely about technology centers, especially Silicon Valley. “But it also, in a way, entrenched the geography of innovation, in part because people weren’t selling and buying homes with such quickness and it was a little harder to change jobs.” And all that compounded the larger trend, she said: “In a digital world, place matters more than ever.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The president of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, Maud Daudon, said that having Northeastern in town, especially in the emerging hub around Amazon, could itself be a new draw to the area. “Northeastern’s presence will help to close the gap between businesses trying to fill positions, and trained, qualified candidates available to go to work,” she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://downtownseattle.com/files/file/June2012DevelopmentGuide.pdf" class="s1" target="_blank">She said that with thousands of people expected to move into the area in the next few years, there is even talk of a South Lake Union area public school. As of the middle of this year, 20 residential apartment and condominium projects were under construction downtown, up from three in 2010, according to the </a><a href="http://downtownseattle.com/files/file/June2012DevelopmentGuide.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">Downtown Seattle</a><a href="http://downtownseattle.com/files/file/June2012DevelopmentGuide.pdf" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://downtownseattle.com/files/file/June2012DevelopmentGuide.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">Association</a><a href="http://downtownseattle.com/files/file/June2012DevelopmentGuide.pdf" class="s1" target="_blank">, a nonprofit economic development group.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But prospective students dropping in to check out Northeastern’s new digs mostly had to imagine it.

The company, which already has agreements to sell its e-readers through supermarket chains like Sainsbury, Dixons and Waitrose, also announced a new partnership with Asda, another supermarket chain.

Similar disappointments are causing carnage at some of Amazon’s land-based electronics competitors. But Amazon’s many fans seemed largely unfazed.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The earnings report, released after the market closed, sent Amazon shares down as much as 9 percent in after-hours trading, but they quickly recovered. The stock hit a record high earlier this year, and it trades at an astronomical price/earnings multiple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What separates Amazon from the competition is that it is not trying to make money. It is instead trying to grow as fast as it can, something it has been doing successfully for 15 years. What was once a cute start-up is now one of the country’s biggest retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Third-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, a little less than the $13.9 billion that analysts expected but up 27 percent from 2011.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite all those customers snapping up Kindles and “50 Shades of Grey,” the company had warned that a loss was coming. Amazon said it lost 60 cents a share in the third quarter, but more than half of that was from its investment in the daily deals site Living Social. The consensus estimate was a loss of 8 cents. Amazon earned 14 cents a share in the third quarter of 2011.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a conference call with analysts, Tom Szkutak, Amazon’s chief financial officer, declined as usual to shed much light on the company’s plans. With regard to the persistent rumor that Amazon will open some pop-up stores during the holidays to sell Kindle devices, for instance, he said that the company’s current practice of selling through other retailers is “not really a driver of our business.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s strategy of selling as cheaply as it can may be tough on its margins but it is tougher on competitors. Radio Shack missed its earnings forecasts this week, prompting doubts about its viability. The specialty home appliance and electronics retailer H. H. Gregg, which operates 200 stores in the Midwest and Southeast, saw its shares drop 13 percent Thursday. Shares of Best Buy fell 10 percent as the store warned that third-quarter profit would be “significantly lower.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Amazon is having a major impact on a number of businesses,” said Jason Moser, who covers Amazon for the Motley Fool investment site and owns shares in the retailer. “We know that chief executive Jeff Bezos is quite patient and has plenty of financial resources. It appears his strategy is working. The third-quarter loss was modest and the long-term implications here are as strong as ever. My faith isn’t dented in the least.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are Amazon skeptics. Colin Gillis of BGC Partners published a haiku before the earnings report: “So much revenue, and with all those shipping costs, so little profit.” What his verse lacked in poetry it made up in cogent criticism.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s operating margins have been about 2 percent or less for the last year. “Amazon has the lowest operating margin and the highest valuation in our technology company coverage,” Mr. Gillis wrote, adding that “the company is not likely to achieve material leverage off its revenue growth as costs associated with investments into its digital platforms build.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Furthermore, “the nature of Amazon’s core business is that of a discount retailer, which limits margin upside.” In the second quarter, the analyst noted, Amazon increased revenues by $2.9 billion but income from operations declined by $95 million to $107 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/technology/amazon-forced-to-collect-sales-tax-aims-to-keep-its-competitive-edge.html?ref=davidstreitfeld" class="s1" target="_blank">The third quarter is mere preamble to the fourth quarter, where Wall Street expects significant revenue growth powered by new Kindle tablets and associated downloads. </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">New warehouses are coming</span>, bringing physical goods to customers so quickly that they will, in theory and no doubt in practice, order more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asked about same-day delivery, Mr. Szkutak said on the conference call that the warehouses have “helped improve our delivery speed to customers.” He added, “What I would expect moving forward would be more of the same.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020121025e8aq002uu</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark10">Google Is Testing Same-Day Delivery for Shoppers</a><a name="bookmark11">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">465 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26 October 2012 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2012 The New York Times Company.

Several San Francisco retailers, including national chains, are participating in the program already.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For shoppers, the service means they can avoid the trouble of driving to the store and some of the wait for items ordered online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Same-day delivery could help physical retailers, which have been under siege from e-commerce companies that offer the convenience of shopping without leaving home. But online retailers offering same-day delivery could make life even harder for physical retailers, because letting people own something the same day has become physical retailers&#39; biggest remaining advantage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The reasons that Google is interested in same-day delivery are less obvious.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/technology/google-shopping-competition-amazon-charging-retailers.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Retail ads are a huge portion of Google&#39;s business, but they are under threat from companies like Amazon, where shoppers increasingly go to search for products, bypassing Google. Also </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/technology/google-shopping-competition-amazon-charging-retailers.html" class="a" target="_blank">responding to the threat</a> <span style=" color: #000;">from Amazon, Google recently tried to improve its comparison shopping service by charging retailers to list their products there. It says retailers are more likely to list accurate and up-to-date items if they are paying.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Additionally, Google has been trying to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds to better understand and profit from mobile ads. On computers, Google and advertisers know if a user clicks on an ad and visits or buys on another Web site. But they lose track of customers who look up a business or product on their phone and then put their phone away, walk into the store and buy something. Online ordering and delivery could help solve that problem.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/tech-companies-venture-into-fashion/" class="a" target="_blank">Tech Companies Venture Into </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/tech-companies-venture-into-fashion/" target="_blank">Fashion</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/amazons-team-of-rivals/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon&#39;s Team of </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/amazons-team-of-rivals/" target="_blank">Rivals</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/the-aws-software-store/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Creates a Software Rental </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/the-aws-software-store/" target="_blank">Store</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/amazon-introduces-a-digital-music-locker/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Introduces a Digital Music </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/amazon-introduces-a-digital-music-locker/" target="_blank">Locker</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;"><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Amazon to Open Android App Store as Apple Sues</span> Document NYTB000020121026e8aq00464</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark12">Daily Report: Apple Has Higher Profit, While Amazon Has a Loss</a><a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">276 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26 October 2012 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2012 The New York Times Company.

Facing intense competition from Apple&#39;s iTunes, the industry shrunk from six major record companies to three.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A merger of Random House and Penguin could help the publishing houses cut costs by combining resources, and it would give them more heft in negotiations with Amazon and Apple as readers increasingly abandon print for cheaper e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Penguin Group USA is among the five major publishers named in a lawsuit filed last spring by the Justice Department, which accused those publishers and Apple of colluding in the pricing of e-books. Three publishers - Hachette Book Group, Simon &amp; Schuster and HarperCollins - settled. Penguin and Macmillan have not. Random House, the largest book publisher in the United States, was not named in the lawsuit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;A combined Random House and Penguin would be a supplier so large it would be very difficult for any anyone to dictate terms to,&quot; said Mike Shatzkin, the founder and chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a consultant to publishers. He added: &quot;You&#39;re allowed to collude if you&#39;re combined.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But for authors and their representatives, news of the merger discussions, first reported by Germany&#39;s Manager Magazin, came as another potential blow in an already challenging profession.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several literary agents said a merger would lead to a consolidation of publishing imprints, thus reducing the number of bidders vying for titles. They also said that combining editing and marketing resources would likely lead to layoffs and potentially put added pressure on authors, especially those who do not churn out mass-market hits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">David Kuhn, a literary agent in New York, said that a shrinking book industry could be compared to the situation in Hollywood, where studios under financial pressure now focus on churning out a handful of blockbusters a year, rather than taking risks on smaller films. &quot;If there are 20 fewer imprints, then that means there are 20 fewer publishers with checkbooks willing to make bets on less known entities,&quot; Mr. Kuhn said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another New York agent, who insisted on anonymity to candidly discuss the deal, was more pessimistic. &quot;This group would be HUGE. NOT good for authors,&quot; the agent wrote in an e-mail</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/forrester-research-inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org" class="s1" target="_blank">James L. McQuivey, a media analyst at </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Forrester Research</span>, said the early panic was justified. &quot;Agents should be terrified because it would give them even fewer people to play against each other,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But, he added, the consolidation of some of the remaining &quot;big six&quot; publishing houses is inevitable. &quot;The need to get some kind of grip on the future of book publishing is driving every single one of these top six publishers in often unconventional ways,&quot; Mr. McQuivey said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A deal between Random House and Penguin would be subject to government approval. Regulators in Europe have demanded significant divestitures as a condition for approval of another recent cultural acquisition, the purchase of EMI by the French media company Vivendi. In the United States, Mr. McQuivey said, regulators could take other factors into account.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;re facing a much bigger threat in Amazon than considering it might restrain competition,&quot; Mr. McQuivey said of the potential merger.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although financial details remain preliminary, Bertelsmann is expected to have an ownership stake of more than 50 percent in Penguin, according to a person briefed on the talks, who was not authorized to discuss the conversations publicly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1998 Bertelsmann paid more than $1 billion to acquire Random House, which now includes 200 editorially independent imprints that publish around 10,000 books a year. In 2011 the publishing house reported revenue of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$2.26 billion, a 4.6 percent decline from a year earlier. In the first half of 2012 Random House reported a 64 percent increase in operating profit, largely because of the success of the &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; trilogy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Penguin, which publishes about 4,000 books annually, had $1.61 billion in revenue in 2011, a 4 percent decrease from the previous year. Revenue from e-books accounted for 12 percent of Penguin&#39;s global revenues in 2011, up from 6 percent in 2010, according to Pearson.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Pearson, based in London, unloading part of its struggling publishing business at a premium could help it focus on its faster growing education business. Earlier this month, Pearson&#39;s longtime chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, said she planned to step down at the end of the year, prompting speculation that the company would eventually sell its publishing units, Penguin and The Financial Times.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Bertelsmann spokeswoman, Susanne Erdl, declined to comment. In a statement Pearson confirmed the talks, adding that &quot;the two companies have not reached agreement and there is no certainty the discussions will lead to a transaction.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts said Thomas Rabe, the chief executive of Bertelsmann, based in Güttersloh, Germany, is under pressure to make a deal because some of the company&#39;s existing businesses are slowing, with no clear plans for growth in the digital era. Mr. Rabe took over about a year ago from Hartmut Ostrowski, who was seen as more of a caretaker, and immediately announced plans to transform Bertelsmann.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Among other things, he changed the company&#39;s legal structure to permit a possible initial public offering of stock, which could raise funds for an acquisition. Buying Penguin would be a big move, though not necessarily the most forward-looking one, given that book publishing, over all, is stagnant or in decline.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If you&#39;re Bertelsmann, would you want to invest in such a slow-growth business?&quot; asked Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum Capital.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/jodi-picoult-changes-publishers/" class="a" target="_blank">Jodi Picoult Changes </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/jodi-picoult-changes-publishers/" target="_blank">Publishers</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/breakfast-meeting-a-new-bin-laden-film-in-the-election-cycle-and-google-settles-with-publishers/" class="a" target="_blank">Breakfast Meeting: A New Bin Laden Film in the Election Cycle, and Google Settles With </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/breakfast-meeting-a-new-bin-laden-film-in-the-election-cycle-and-google-settles-with-publishers/" target="_blank">Publishers</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/universal-closes-on-emi-deal-becoming-by-far-biggest-of-remaining-big-three/" class="a" target="_blank">Universal Closes on EMI Deal, Becoming, by Far, Biggest of Remaining Big </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/universal-closes-on-emi-deal-becoming-by-far-biggest-of-remaining-big-three/" target="_blank">Three</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/two-out-of-print-nora-ephron-books-to-be-published-as-single-volume/" class="a" target="_blank">Two Out-of-Print Nora Ephron Books to Be Published as Single </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/two-out-of-print-nora-ephron-books-to-be-published-as-single-volume/" target="_blank">Volume</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Jon Platt, Powerful Talent Scout in Urban Music, to Join Warner/Chappell</span> Document NYTB000020121025e8ap003bj</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 3 end/Image_004.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark18">BITS</a><a name="bookmark19">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon Shutdown Affects Some Web Sites</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By NICOLE PERLROTH</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">354 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23 October 2012 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 2</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.

But how are those tablets even doing anyway?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It turns out that the number of seven-inch tablets sold by each of Apple&#39;s major competitors is small compared to the number of iPads it has sold.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To date, Apple has sold about 84 million iPads. Amazon&#39;s Kindle Fire, the second-best-selling tablet, has sold about seven million units; Barnes and Noble has sold about five million Nook tablets; and Google has sold about three million Nexus 7 tablets, according to estimates by Forrester.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s about 15 million tablets across three companies. And while no single company presents a major threat to Apple yet, it&#39;s not a number to sneeze at - after all, that&#39;s 15 million more iPads that Apple could have sold. So it makes sense that the company is preparing its own smaller tablet at a lower price, said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester analyst.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Apple is smart to be acting before it gets to be more of a problem,&quot; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Steve Jobs once dismissed seven-inch tablets</span>, saying they were &quot;tweeners&quot; that were too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with an iPad. Several sources have said Apple&#39;s smaller iPad will be 7.85 inches, which is a bit bigger than 7 inches but might still be considered a &quot;tweener.&quot; Would these sell nearly as well as the current iPad?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stephen Baker, an analyst with the NPD Group, thinks smaller tablets are a viable category because they cater to people who don&#39;t want to spend too much money on a tablet, or those who just want something smaller to carry with them everywhere.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Rotman Epps agreed. She said a 7.85-inch iPad could also broaden the product&#39;s appeal to women because it would most likely fit in a purse.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/the-kindle-fire-is-bad-but-thats-good/" class="a" target="_blank">The Kindle Fire: Clunky but </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/the-kindle-fire-is-bad-but-thats-good/" target="_blank">Content-Rich</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/amazon-apple-tablets-flash/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon and Apple&#39;s Giant Markups on Flash </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/amazon-apple-tablets-flash/" target="_blank">Storage</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/why-apple-might-be-better-off-losing-its-patent-lawsuit/" class="a" target="_blank">Why Apple Might be Better Off Losing Its Patent </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/why-apple-might-be-better-off-losing-its-patent-lawsuit/" target="_blank">Lawsuit</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/pulp-friction-the-debate-over-amazons-fire/" class="a" target="_blank">Pulp Friction: The Kindle </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/pulp-friction-the-debate-over-amazons-fire/" target="_blank">Debate</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">E-Book Sellers Face a Battle to Win iPad Customers</span> Document NYTB000020121019e8aj004xv</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark24">Technology</a><a name="bookmark25">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">EBay’s Focus on Mobile Apps Helps Lift Revenue 15%</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By NICOLE PERLROTH</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">713 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">18 October 2012 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012.

The once troubled online retailer has continued a successful turnaround and cultivated double-digit growth in PayPal, its online payments system.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just three years ago, eBay’s core auction business had stalled and its stock price was down to $10, a far cry from its peak of $58 in 2004. At today’s closing price of $48.20, the company’s stock is up 54 percent for the year, more than the 37 percent gain of its rival Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“That’s a significant run,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with the brokerage firm BCG Partners. “The core story behind eBay is that they are doing all the right things.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.ebayinc.com/content/press_release/20121017006609" class="s1" target="_blank">Results were </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">strong again in the third quarter</span>. On Wednesday, eBay reported that net income rose $597 million or 45 cents a share, a 22 percent jump from the quarter a year earlier. Revenue climbed 15 percent to $3.4 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">John J. Donahoe, eBay’s chief executive, attributed the company’s performance in part to an early bet that mobile phones would become a platform for commerce, with PayPal providing a lead in mobile payments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We’re the largest mobile commerce and payments provider in the world,” Mr. Donahoe said in an interview on Wednesday. “And we are continuing to innovate. We have a series of innovative apps that people are using. People love shopping on their smartphones and iPad, and PayPal is still the safest way to pay on a mobile phone.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EBay’s mobile apps have been downloaded more than 100 million times worldwide. EBay sellers are now posting two million items a week from their smartphones and, last quarter, over 800,000 new users made their first eBay purchase from a smartphone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Marketplaces, eBay’s biggest business, brought in $1.8 billion in revenue last quarter, up 9 percent from a year ago. PayPal — which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion 10 years ago — brought in $1.37 billion in revenue last quarter, a 23 percent jump from the same quarter a year ago, and it is expected to surpass Marketplaces in revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“If you do the math, that will be three to five years out if current trends continue,” Mr. Donahoe said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The company, based in San Jose, Calif., expects each business to achieve $10 billion in volume in 2012, more than double the volume in 2011. The operating profit margin increased to 19.6 percent from 18.1 percent in the same period last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EBay is now experimenting with a new mobile app called eBay Now. The app, which is being tested by consumers in San Francisco, allows eBay customers to buy products — from their phones — from Macy’s, Target and Walgreens, and have them delivered the same day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What our research says is that consumers like choice,” Mr. Donahoe said. “People may want an item to come to their office that day, their house the following day and get other items in a couple days. We’re giving them that choice.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If its experiment is successful, eBay Now could mount a challenge to Amazon’s shipping service, Amazon Prime, a program that offers customers unlimited free two-day shipping on millions of items for $79 a year. Increasingly, fast delivery is shaping up as the new battleground for online merchants.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But strong performance also breeds high expectations. Last quarter, analysts scrambled to raise their estimates after the company reported a 144 percent jump in profit from a year earlier. The third quarter’s 15 percent revenue increase, while impressive, was just below the $3.41 billion that Wall Street analysts had expected.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company’s stock dipped slightly in after-hours trading after eBay guided analysts to trim their estimates for the fourth quarter.

People who buy that Surface model will get some extra perks though, including 32 gigabytes of storage - twice the amount of the cheapest third-generation iPad - and a 10.6-inch display, rather than the iPad&#39;s 9.7-inch display.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/18/3095396/microsoft-surface-cover-multitouch-keyboard" class="s1" target="_blank">Microsoft said it would sell a 32-gigabyte Surface bundled with a black </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">Touch Cover</span>, a keyboard that doubles as a protective shield for the tablet, for $600. A similar bundle with a 64-gigabyte Surface will cost $700. Microsoft will sell Touch Covers separately in a wider assortment of colors for $120, and a different type of keyboard cover with moving keys, called Type Cover, will sell for $130.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It&#39;s clear Microsoft is aiming Surface at what is shaping up to be the premium portion of the tablet market, which Apple currently dominates. Amazon, in contrast, seems intent on using price as a weapon to gain market share against its rivals. The company recently introduced an 8.9-inch-screen Kindle Fire that starts at $300.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/apple-likely-to-introduce-smaller-ipad-in-october-event/" class="s1" target="_blank">Microsoft has not yet said whether it will bring out a version of Surface that competes in the small-screen tablet category. Google&#39;s Nexus 7 tablet starts at $200, while Amazon&#39;s seven-inch Kindle Fire starts at $160. Apple is </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/apple-likely-to-introduce-smaller-ipad-in-october-event/" class="a" target="_blank">expected</a> <span style=" color: #000;">to announce a new, smaller iPad next week.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surface will go on sale Oct. 26 in Microsoft retail stores in the United States and Canada. The company said the product would be sold online in Britain, China, France, Germany and several other countries.

Now, the retailer is poised to use those stores against its online rival once again — this time aiming for the heart of Amazon’s retail model.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://delivery.walmart.com/usd-estore/home/homecontainer.jsp" class="s1" target="_blank">Wal-Mart said Tuesday it had begun </a><a href="http://delivery.walmart.com/usd-estore/home/homecontainer.jsp" class="a" target="_blank">testing same-day delivery</a> <span style=" color: #000;">for online purchases in a handful of cities across the country.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The near-instant delivery is possible because the merchandise is being shipped from Walmart stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The first retailer to master same-day delivery on a wide scale could attract customers who have avoided online purchases because they wanted items immediately, and encourage current shoppers to add products that they usually buy from supermarkets or drugstores, including celery and toothpaste.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But some retail analysts are questioning whether the expense and difficulty of same-day delivery would be worth it.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/technology/amazon-forced-to-collect-sales-tax-aims-to-keep-its-competitive-edge.html?ref=davidstreitfeld" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon is the world’s largest online retailer, and </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/technology/amazon-forced-to-collect-sales-tax-aims-to-keep-its-competitive-edge.html?ref=davidstreitfeld" class="a" target="_blank">in an interview last month</a> <span style=" color: #000;">, Jeff Bezos, its chief executive, said that the company was striving for same-day delivery in metropolitan areas. Its Web site says same-day delivery is available in limited cases. Mr. Bezos said Amazon would soon be able to cut as much as a day off its shipping times, raising the possibility of same-day delivery in cities where it has distribution centers.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Wal-Mart expanded its same-day shipping across the country, it could essentially transform the more than 4,000 Walmarts, along with Sam’s Club and other divisions, into distribution centers. Amazon, by contrast, had fewer than 40 distribution centers in the United States at the end of last year and has plans to add about 20 worldwide this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Everybody in retail is terrified of Amazon, and they’re terrified of losing more wallet share to Amazon,” said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research. The Wal-Mart move is “to try to get ahead of the curve if Amazon does introduce something like this.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wal-Mart and Amazon once operated in separate spheres — Wal-Mart’s offline, Amazon’s online. And Amazon’s sales, at $48 billion in 2011, are more than a tenth of Wal-Mart’s, which were $419 billion in 2011. But increasingly, they are competing for the same customer and the same turf.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For instance, in a move that probably hurt Wal-Mart, Amazon last year offered customers a discount on items they scanned in physical stores, letting it pluck shoppers as they strolled the aisles of stores like Walmart. And its subscription Prime service, offering free two-day delivery on many items, has gotten customers buying staples like toilet paper from it rather than from nearby groceries and Walmarts.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/business/retailers-lure-online-shoppers-offline.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has been building up its e-commerce site as it tries to do things that Amazon cannot, such as allowing customers to </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/business/retailers-lure-online-shoppers-offline.html" class="a" target="_blank">pay for online purchases with cash</a> <span style=" color: #000;">. “Connecting our Web site to our stores gives us a unique advantage, so customers can shop anytime, anywhere,” said Amy Lester, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Both retailers have the same goal: to be the general store where customers will buy apparel, food, home décor and just about everything else, no matter how they want to order and receive the goods.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet same-day delivery may not make financial sense, Ms. Mulpuru said. “If you don’t care about losing a lot of money, sure, you can pull this off,” she said. “The question is: Can you pull this off profitably? I’m not convinced.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She pointed to retailers that already offer same-day delivery in some areas, like Barnes &amp; Noble, and said that the service had not been a game-changer. People who live in dense urban areas and who do not have cars might find same-day delivery useful, but for those in suburban or rural areas a short drive to a Walmart is easier than waiting for a delivery, she said.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/business/retailers-lure-online-shoppers-offline.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Physical retailers have been trying to figure out how to turn their stores into competitive advantages. With staff, inventory and real estate, stores have many costs that online retailers do not have. Wal-Mart and a few others have started using the stores to </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/business/retailers-lure-online-shoppers-offline.html" class="a" target="_blank">offer services to online shoppers</a> <span style=" color: #000;">, including shipping items (but not same-day), free returns, ordering online and picking up in a store and payment centers. However, few offline retailers offer same-day delivery. They rarely have enough locations to make it feasible, and there are logistical hurdles.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Wal-Mart tests, the first of which started last week in the Washington suburbs, let customers order toys and other popular gifts, and have them delivered to their homes the same day. Ms. Lester, the Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the company chose which items to include based on what was popular in its order-online, pick-up-in-store service. The same-day service costs $10, with no minimum purchase.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wal-Mart has been testing same-day grocery delivery for more than two years in San Jose, Calif., and now offers it in San Francisco, too. But this is the first time it is trying to ship general merchandise within a day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To receive goods on the same day, consumers must place an order before noon, and select a four-hour window when they want the items delivered. United Parcel Service is handling deliveries. The current test includes toys, sports equipment, home décor and electronics — all popular holiday items.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/amazoncom-introduces-same-day-delivery/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon has offered limited items</a> <span style=" color: #000;">, in limited areas, for same-day delivery since 2009, its Web site says. Its Prime service, which costs $79 a year, is popular. “Prime members buy at a faster rate in all categories,” Mr. Bezos said this year. “One of the big advantages of Amazon for consumers is that they can get one box with a lot of things in it from different categories.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Wal-Mart program is already running in Northern Virginia and Philadelphia. It was introduced Tuesday in Minneapolis, and the San Jose and San Francisco areas that are already part of the grocery test will join the toys-and-gifts test this fall.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“This is definitely a holiday test, but we don’t have an end date at this point,” Ms. Lester said. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document NYTFEED020121009e8aa002mj</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark32">With Steve Jobs Tribute, a Home Page Reflects Apple&#39;s Founder Again</a><a name="bookmark33">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By NICK WINGFIELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">504 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5 October 2012 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2012 The New York Times Company.

Every once in a while, though, it turns into something unlike any other big company&#39;s home page.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Friday was one such day, when Apple&#39;s home page featured a video tribute to Steven P. Jobs, the company&#39;s co-founder and former chief executive who died a year ago to the day. The 105-second video consisted of still black-and-white images of Mr. Jobs with audio of him announcing Apple products like the iPhone and describing Apple&#39;s corporate philosophy. The music on the soundtrack is Bach&#39;s Prelude No. 1 in G Major for Cello, played by Yo-Yo Ma, who was a friend of Mr. Jobs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The home page take-over made it modestly more difficult for Apple customers, most of whom were probably unaware that Friday was the anniversary of Mr. Jobs&#39;s death, to buy Apple products. After the video finished playing and a letter from Timothy D.

Amazon, for instance, periodically wipes all of the normal product pitches from its front door to replace them with letters from its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, including </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/an-amazon-education/" class="a" target="_blank">one</a> <span style=" color: #000;">in July about an education and training program to help Amazon workers improve their skills.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under Mr. Jobs though, Apple&#39;s home page occasionally became a showcase for events and people that had very little to do with Apple&#39;s business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2007, after Al Gore, the former vice president and an Apple board member, won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work bringing attention to climate change, Apple devoted most of its home page to celebrating the event. &quot;We are bursting with pride for Al and this historic recognition of his global contributions,&quot; a message on the page said.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kernelpanic/11387944/in/set-283374/" class="s1" target="_blank">When people that Mr. Jobs admired died, Apple.com was made over in similar fashion.

It is also the latest evidence of the shift to e-books from print, and of Google&#39;s efforts to compete with e-book rivals like Amazon.com. Digital books were a new and daunting prospect when the publishers first sued Google seven years ago, but they have now become commonplace.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The publishers involved in the settlement are the McGraw-Hill Companies, Pearson Education, the Penguin Group, John Wiley &amp; Sons and Simon &amp; Schuster. The deal allows the publishers to choose whether to allow Google to digitize their out-of-print books that are still under copyright protection. If Google does so, it will allow people to read 20 percent of the books online and purchase the entire books from the Google Play store. It will share revenue with the publishers, but the precise financial terms were not disclosed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google has been offering publishers the opportunity to sell digital books for years, and digitizing new books has become routine for publishers. But under the settlement, publishers get the benefit of Google digitizing out-of-print books that they might not otherwise have turned into e-books. Meanwhile, Google can expand the library of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-books it sells to consumers.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/judge-approves-e-book-pricing-settlement/" class="a" target="_blank">Judge Approves E-Book Pricing </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/judge-approves-e-book-pricing-settlement/" target="_blank">Settlement</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/amazon-pulls-thousands-of-e-books-in-dispute/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Pulls Thousands of E-Books in </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/amazon-pulls-thousands-of-e-books-in-dispute/" target="_blank">Dispute</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/e-book-sellers-face-a-battle-to-win-ipad-customers/" class="a" target="_blank">E-Book Sellers Face a Battle to Win iPad </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/e-book-sellers-face-a-battle-to-win-ipad-customers/" target="_blank">Customers</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/bits-scan-verizon-fees-e-book-profits-and-chilean-telescopes/" class="a" target="_blank">Bits Scan: Verizon Fees, E-Book Profits and Chilean </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/bits-scan-verizon-fees-e-book-profits-and-chilean-telescopes/" target="_blank">Telescopes</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">When It Comes to Content, Amazon&#39;s Kindle Won&#39;t Be Undersold</span> Document NYTB000020121005e8a50020a</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 3 end/Image_005.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark36">STATE OF THE ART</a><a name="bookmark37">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Newly Enlightened E-Readers</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID POGUE</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,408 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 October 2012</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.

You write about a building once, and your review remains basically fresh forever.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you&#39;re a tech critic, though, the state of the art changes monthly, if not hourly. You toil over writing a masterpiece, and it winds up having the shelf life of milk.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It could be worse. Instead of writing about gadgets, you could be stuck with an even worse treadmill job: making them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pity, for example, the poor slobs at Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble, locked in an endless battle for e-reader supremacy. They play an annual game of leapfrog that would exhaust frogs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I see your new color tablet,&#39;&#39; says Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s Nook team, &#39;&#39;and I raise you one higher-resolution screen!&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Oh, yeah?&#39;&#39; says Amazon&#39;s Kindle team. &#39;&#39;Well, you know the Nook with a self-illuminated screen that you introduced in April? We have one with a better backlight. Take that!&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s a real example. There are two kinds of e-book gadgets. There are those with E Ink screens (cheap, light, thin, no color, long battery life, great to read in bright sunlight, useless in the dark). And there are those with color screens (heavier, thicker, pricier, great to read in low light, tough to read in sunlight).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">People who opt for E Ink rave about the &#39;&#39;printed&#39;&#39; look of the black text on a light gray &#39;&#39;page.&#39;&#39; They can also be found spending $60 on a case that contains a tiny flip-up flashlight -- or just carrying one around on a keychain -- so that they can read in bed or in other darkish situations. E Ink is so much like paper, it doesn&#39;t light up on its own.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In April, Barnes &amp; Noble changed the game: it offered an E Ink e-reader whose background lights up with a soft glow, like a digital watch. With the introduction of that model -- the efficiently named Barnes &amp; Noble Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight -- the company hacked off one enormous item on the list of E Ink drawbacks. Not only is reading in bed practical, it&#39;s actually superior to reading an actual book, since the gentle glowing screen is nowhere near bright enough to keep a sleeping partner awake.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your move, Kindle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s response to the B&amp;NNSTGL (now $120) is the new Kindle Paperwhite (same price). The headline here is that the Paperwhite&#39;s lighting is better than the Nook&#39;s.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At top brightness, it&#39;s much brighter. More usefully, its lighting is far more even than the Nook&#39;s, whose</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">edge-mounted lamps can create subtle &#39;&#39;hot spots&#39;&#39; at the top and bottom of the page, sometimes spilling out from there. How much unevenness depends on how high you&#39;ve turned up the light. But in the hot spots, the black letters of the text show less contrast.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Kindle Paperwhite has hot spots, too, but only at the bottom edge, where the four low-power LED bulbs sit. (Amazon says that from there, the light is pumped out across the screen through a flattened fiber optic cable.) In the middle of the page, where the text is, the lighting is perfectly even: no low-contrast text areas.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Kindle&#39;s screen also packs in 212 tiny dots an inch, compared with the Nook&#39;s 167, for visibly sharper text.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both models have touch screens, which is a real joy; you can tap lightly to turn the page or bring up a panel that controls type size, font choice, margins and line spacing. But on the Kindle&#39;s screen, you can use two fingers.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s primarily useful when you want to adjust the type size (most of us will, in fact, be over 40 at some point); you can just spread two fingers apart, as on an iPad, without having to open some settings screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When viewed side-by-side with the Nook GlowLight, the Paperwhite is much more comfortable to read. You could argue that that&#39;s an important factor in a reading tablet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Kindle Paperwhite and Nook are about the same height (4.6 inches), but the Kindle is 0.4 inch narrower and slightly thinner. Thin is great -- you can cradle the entire thing in one hand; on the other hand, the Nook&#39;s</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">soft-touch back panel has a gentle sculptured ridge that makes one-handed holding comfortable and secure.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All right, the Paperwhite has superior lighting and sharpness. The Nook, however, has some persuasive counterarguments of its own -- starting with the value.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both readers may seem to cost $120, but for that money, Barnes &amp; Noble includes a wall charger. (The Kindle charges only from the USB jack on a computer, unless you spring $10 more for the charger.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Kindle displays ads. They appear on the screen saver and across the bottom of the Home screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, those ads -- commonplace in the Kindle line -- are a brazen move by Amazon. You might think that it&#39;s obnoxious for Amazon to advertise on a gadget you own. You&#39;d think that your personal property would be exempt from commercial intrusions; it would be like finding ads on your car&#39;s dashboard or your phone&#39;s Home screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In practice, however, most Kindlers don&#39;t seem to mind. You can pay $20 extra to have them removed, but few people bother. The ads are fairly subtle, they appear only in places where you don&#39;t spend much time, and $20 is</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$20.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, the Nook never puts ads on your screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Nook has a half-ounce weight advantage, which is important in a gadget that you hold all the time. It also has physical, clicking page-turn buttons on each side of the screen, which accounts for its extra width.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Nook also has a memory-card slot for more storage. The Kindle offers two gigabytes of storage, which the company says is enough for more than 1,000 books, so running out of room isn&#39;t a knuckle-biting concern.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Besides, you get unlimited storage on Amazon.com for anything you&#39;ve bought from its e-book store; you can re-download any book when you need it. (Especially if you&#39;ve sprung an extra $60 for the cellular version, which gets you online wherever you are -- no charge.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But if you&#39;re a candidate for the next mission to Alpha Centauri, it&#39;s good to know that the Nook is ready for a bigger library.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can turn off the backlighting on the Nook, too. On the Kindle, it&#39;s on all the time. You can turn it way down low, but not off. Amazon&#39;s rationale is that the light imposes no battery-life penalty, so why not simplify life and have it on all the time? Even with the light on, the Kindle lasts eight weeks of reading 30 minutes a day (with Wi-Fi off); that&#39;s twice as long as the Nook with the same settings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You have a dizzying number of options in e-readers these days. You can go with an iPad ($500 and up, gorgeous, big, heavy, almost as useful as a laptop). You could get a $200 color touch-screen reader (Kindle HD, Google&#39;s Nexus 7 or the coming Nook HD), which offers great reading and movie viewing, and a few apps.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But if what you mostly want to do is read, a self-illuminating E Ink reader still sits at the sweetest spot on the price-weight-size-beach-bedroom matrix.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both of these light-up readers are backed by e-bookstores that would raise the Library of Congress&#39;s eyebrows. Both are oozing with features -- annotations, dictionary definitions and so on.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The glowy Nook has more hardware features and a better price. But if you&#39;re choosing an E Ink reader over the color models, it&#39;s because what you intend to do mostly is stare at that screen, lost in your reading. In that case, the display of the page is more important than any other factor, and that&#39;s where the Kindle Paperwhite shines.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:pogue@nytimes.com" class="s1" target="_blank">E-mail: pogue@nytimes.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Top, the Kindle Paperwhite from Amazon, in a cover.
