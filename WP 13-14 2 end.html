Sure, there&#39;s great content from entertainment partners, voice search and the ability to play video games, but nothing obvious that would suggest that Fire TV is somehow the future of TV. It even looks a lot like the Apple TV. For now, the launch of Fire TV is more of a way to poach consumers away from companies such as Apple and give non-Amazon consumers one more reason to explore the entertainment options of Amazon&#39;s ecosystem. Every dollar you might have spent with Apple you&#39;d now be spending with Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But let&#39;s think about the next iteration of Fire TV. By then, Amazon will have most likely figured out ways to embed e-commerce options into Fire TV. That would be big it would mean that consumers would most likely be able to purchase products directly from their TV. Imagine watching the latest streaming content from Netflix or Showtime (two of the launch partners announced for Fire TV), and simultaneously being able to purchase clothing worn by one of the characters in a hit TV show, all without leaving your seat on the couch. Even better for Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, imagine watching original studio content produced by Amazon (e.g. &quot;Alpha House&quot;) and then purchasing items featured in those shows easily and conveniently from Amazon partners.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unlike all the other tech companies out there trying to reinvent TV, Amazon is also the world&#39;s largest</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-commerce company that also happens to have an awful lot of data already about you. Fire TV arrives</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pre-registered to your Amazon account, and that means, at some point in the future, Amazon could make it a seamless process to go from watching entertainment content to buying things online. Amazon already knows what types of books you like, what types of films you prefer to watch and when you like to watch them. There&#39;s early buzz about the Amazon &quot;ASAP&quot; feature that enables Amazon to deliver video content to you even before you&#39;ve ordered it, based only on its knowledge of your viewing habits. ASAP predicts what movies and TV episodes you&#39;ll want to watch and buffers them for playback before you hit play.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Imagine what happens when Amazon adds an ASAP feature for other products, as well. That means that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ad-supported model or subscription-based model for TV could one day become an e-commerce supported model. By launching Fire TV, Amazon has pieced together the next element of its entertainment ecosystem that makes possible a combination of all three business models. For Kindle Fire users, Amazon already has a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">subscription-based option for viewing video entertainment as well as an a la carte option. With Fire TV, it now has the makings of an ad-supported and e-commerce supported model.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It will be interesting to see the answering moves from the likes of Apple and Roku, both of which have popular streaming set-top boxes. It&#39;s almost a no-brainer that Apple will introduce a voice search option in an upcoming version of Apple TV, and may attempt to replicate the Amazon ASAP buffering feature with some kind of &quot;genius&quot; option. Who knows? Maybe Apple will decide to launch endless patent wars against Amazon and Fire TV, the same way it has launched patent wars to stifle competition from Samsung in the smartphone market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For all the talk of Internet TV going mainstream and all the stories about consumers watching TV on their mobile devices, it&#39;s clear that the TV in the living room still has an important role to play in determining the competitive mix of the tech industry. You can&#39;t argue with the numbers, which suggest that Americans still consume the</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">overwhelming majority of their video content on their TV. Yet, there&#39;s enough fragmentation in the way people watch TV that the Amazon set-top box may simplify the decision-making process for consumers willing to commit to a specific content ecosystem. With the launch of Fire TV, it&#39;s clear that Amazon has figured out the new logic of the tech industry: the company that controls your TV wins.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NEW YORK — Amazon.com stepped into the fight to control America&#39;s televisions Wednesday, unveiling a $99 set-top box known as Fire TV.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The small black device will allow viewers to watch movies and other video content on their televisions, bridging a gap between shopping and entertainment that the firm has long strived to address.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It puts Amazon at the center of a growing battle among tech giants to reinvent TV watching. Televisions have become thinner and larger in the past decade, but the industry has struggled to make them any smarter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon said its device would make it easier for consumers to find the content they want and address the poor video streaming quality that keeps some from watching shows online. The device also comes with components normally found in top-level smartphones, including advanced WiFi antennas to keep customers from that frustrating buffering experience. Fire TV includes voice search — something that industry observers have long expected Apple to do with its Siri technology — allowing users to speak into the remote to find a genre, actor or title.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This is voice search that actually works,&quot; said Kindle Vice President Peter Larsen, perhaps taking a dig at Apple&#39;s Siri or the voice-control capabilities in Microsoft&#39;s Xbox One.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon also threw in an curveball. Fire TV will also work as a stripped-down game console, launching with such titles as Minecraft and Asphalt 8.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon faces stiff competition, and others have tried — and failed — to gain a foothold in America&#39;s living rooms. According to data from Nielsen published in February, Americans spend an average of 185 hours per month with their televisions, as opposed to 34 hours and 21 minutes with their smartphones. And although mobile use is on a steady rise — up an average of six hours from the same time last year — much of that time is spent accessing entertainment content.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To compete, Amazon must take on Roku, the market leader in the set-top box space. It will also go against Apple&#39;s &quot;hobby&quot; product, the Apple TV, which has never taken off outside of the firm&#39;s most devoted fans. Google, which tried and largely failed to get a foothold in the smart television space a couple of years ago, finally hit on a solution last year with the $35 Chromecast, but it still does not have the content breadth to compete widely.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most of Roku&#39;s devices are cheaper and give consumers access to more video content. But &quot;Roku has to be nervous,&quot; said Forrester Research analyst James L. McQuivey. Amazon will take awhile to catch up, particularly overseas, where Roku and Apple see stronger sales, but U.S. customers are looking for an easy way to get streaming content on the television, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The media landscape has become fractured with viewers choosing between content from several streaming sites, cable providers, broadcast channels, video-on-demand services and more. Sifting through multiple services&#39; catalogues is a frustrating experience when all you want to do is satisfy a movie craving.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s gotten worse,&quot; said Dan Rayburn, principal analyst at Frost &amp; Sullivan and executive vice president of StreamingMedia.com. &quot;There are more guys with more devices. As more services come out, and they&#39;re not all through one portal, you have to go directly to all of these things. That&#39;s part of the problem with fragmentation as more of these devices come to the market.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The launch marks Amazon&#39;s most aggressive push into the hardware business since the Kindle Fire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They have the marketing power and ability to push it hard,&quot; Rayburn said, adding that Amazon is no stranger to pushing cheap hardware to sell more content. That was the firm&#39;s strategy with its Kindle line of e-readers and tablets for years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And there is a lot of potential upside for Amazon. Those who own the Amazon Kindle, for example, spend $400 more at Amazon than those who don&#39;t, according to a study from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. The same firm has also estimated that Prime members spend twice as much as non-Prime members. A streaming video gadget could provide the same kind of boost for Amazon, analysts say.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon could have gone further, however, by leveraging its retail expertise and letting consumers use the device&#39;s voice-control capabilities for purchases, as well, McQuivey said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What we eventually want is television commerce, to be able to buy things from your TV,&quot; he said. It&#39;s a space, he said, that Amazon should &quot;carve out specifically for itself.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:hayley.tsukayama@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">(Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NEW YORK — Amazon.com unveiled Amazon Fire TV on Wednesday, saying it wants to take the pain out of the digital video-watching process.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Navigating through the current digital video ecosystem can be a slow, complicated process, the company said, and it&#39;s hoping that Fire TV will provide consumers who are watching video from a wide variety of sources with an easy way to watch exactly what they want.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;How do we make the complexity disappear?&quot; said Peter Larsen, vice president of the company&#39;s Kindle division.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Larsen outlined three major problems that consumers face: difficulty finding what you&#39;re looking for, poor video streaming quality and limited, fragmented libraries of content.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To solve the first problem, Amazon has built voice search into the box — something that industry observers have long expected Apple to do with its Siri technology — letting users speak into the remote to find the genre, actor or title that they&#39;re looking for.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Addressing the problem of lagging video streaming, the firm has built the device with components normally found in top-level smartphones as well as advanced WiFi antennas to keep customers from that frustrating buffering experience.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the third point, while the firm has been building its own library of media content during the past couple of years, it is also clear that it would need help to have a competitive streaming device. Other launch partners include Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube and sports channels such as MLB.TV.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, Amazon was careful to highlight its own original content such as the Washington-centric comedy &quot;Alpha House,&quot; which is coming back for a second season.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The firm also threw in a small curveball, announcing that the Fire TV will also work as a stripped-down game console, launching with titles such as &quot;Minecraft&quot; and &quot;Asphalt 8&quot; already in its content catalog. The company also showed off titles of its own design — made through Amazon Game Studios — such as &quot;Sev Zero,&quot; a combination tower-defense and first-person shooter game.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gamers can use the included remote to play games, though the company is also releasing its own, dedicated game controller for $39.99.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The device will cost $99, which is on par with Apple&#39;s Apple TV and Roku&#39;s top-of-the-line set-top box, although significantly more expensive than Google&#39;s $35 Chromecast streaming stick and a similar device recently released by Roku. The Fire TV begins shipping Wednesday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Disclaimer: Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P.

For all the talk of drones, wearables, homes of the future and flying Internet networks, the truth is that tech companies are still keenly interested in the consumer electronics device that&#39;s been a fixture in the American living room for decades: the television.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon.com is holding a major media event Wednesday to talk about the future of their video business, which is widely expected to be the moment where it becomes one of an increasingly crowded group of firms who want to control your time on the couch. Speculation has been flying for years that Amazon will release a streaming video device -- similar to Apple&#39;s Apple TV or Google&#39;s Chromecast -- that brings online video content, and potentially Android-based games, to the largest screen in your house.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why? Despite what you may think, the TV is still where people turn for the bulk of their screen time, and Amazon wants to be a main portal for all of your entertainment. (Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to the data from the Nielsen published in February, Americans still spend an average of 185 hours per month with their televisions, as opposed to 34 hours and 21 minutes with their smartphones. And while mobile use is on a steady rise -- up an average of six hours from the same time last year -- much of that time is spent accessing entertainment, with Americans reporting 15 percent of all their mobile time is devoted to that exact purpose.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And as the media landscape becomes more fractured thanks to viewers picking up content on streaming sites, cable, broadcast channels, video-on-demand services and more, offering something that make it easy and comfortable to watch all that video via one service is more appealing than ever, analysts say. Right now, consumers are constantly sifting through multiple services&#39; catalogs -- a frustrating experience when all you want to do is satisfy a movie craving.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s gotten worse,&quot; said Dan Rayburn, principal analyst at Frost &amp; Sullivan and executive vice president of StreamingMedia.com. &quot;There are more guys with more devices.

For Amazon, which could work at a much larger scale, the costs would be nearly negligible.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;What is the cost to Amazon for a box like that?&quot; Rayburn said. &quot;They could afford to eat $20 bucks [per device] to get more Prime members.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And the potential for upside could be enormous. Those who own the Amazon Kindle, for example, spend over</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$400 more at Amazon than those who don&#39;t, according to a study from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.

Roku is the market leader in the set-top box space, but may have trouble competing with Amazon&#39;s sheer scale, he said. It&#39;s followed by Apple&#39;s &quot;hobby&quot; product, the Apple TV, which has never taken off outside of the firm&#39;s most devoted fans. Google, which tried and largely failed to get a foothold in the smart television space  a couple of years ago, finally hit on a solution last year with the $35 Chromecast, but still doesn&#39;t have the content breadth to compete with either.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To see early success, Rayburn said, Amazon must beat Apple on price and chip away at Roku&#39;s market share -- something it certainly has shown in the past it has the patience to do.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140402ea42004h6</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark10">Business</a><a name="bookmark11">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services authorized to contract with more Defense Department agencies; AWS can now host certain projects such as public-facing Web sites or open data sets for the department.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Mohana Ravindranath 265 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2 April 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When we talk about the future of television, much of the conversation tends to concentrate around subscriptions as an old solution to a new problem. When network television ratings are diving, guaranteed revenue from users seems like a surer bet than ad sales, especially if advertisers begin to worry that their dollars are buying them fewer eyeballs per show. Upstarts like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and even PlayStation have tried to emulate premium cable, collecting regular fees from a stable subscriber pool, rather than their network counterparts, which rely heavily on ad sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Until now. Amazon is expected to announce that the company will launch a free streaming service supported by ads, making it a lot more like Hulu or networks like NBC than like Netflix. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Amazon now bundles two separate businesses together. Through a subscription to its Prime service, customers get free two-day shipping on many of the items Amazon offers for sale and access to a large library of streaming video content, including shows and movies Amazon licensed, and the original shows it has in production.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the new service launches, Prime will still exist for those of us who are heavy Amazon purchasers. And while it is not yet clear which streaming content will continue to live behind a paywall and which will be part of the new free service, early reports suggest that Amazon original shows, like tech comedy &quot;Betas,&quot; Garry Trudeau&#39;s &quot;Alpha House&quot; and Jill Soloway&#39;s new family dramedy &quot;Transparent,&quot; as well as some licensed shows and movies, will be available without a subscription.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The move is a nod to the power of the traditional television business model. And that model makes even more sense for Amazon, which has a number of advantages that broadcast television networks and its streaming competitors do not share. Amazon&#39;s television network is housed in a giant retailer that sells all sorts of products and collects enormous amounts of data about customers. Last week, my colleague Catherine Rampell suggested that the National Security Agency and Facebook should just team up already to give her relevant advertising that does not make her feel horrible about herself. Amazon can serve those personalized ads in a way that broadcast networks cannot and that Hulu is trying to do with much more limited customer data. And it serves them to consumers who are already watching content in the very same browser window they can use to purchase the products on offer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That may mean that Amazon has to solicit many more ads to cover its huge inventory or that it will have to develop an in-house template for cheap ads to cover products Amazon knows could pop through targeted ads, even if the companies selling them do not have huge promotional budgets. But the experiment seems worth the hassle. One of the truisms of the Internet age has been that while we may not pay for content for dollars, we pay for it in data. Amazon seems like it may have found a way to get us to pay in data, and then turn that data around on us to get us to spend real money, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Update (8:23 p.m.): Amazon spokeswoman Sally Fouts wrote to me Thursday evening to deny reports in the Wall Street Journal and elsewhere that the company is planning a free streaming service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We have a video advertising business that currently offers programs like First Episode Free and ads associated with movie and game trailers, and we&#39;re often experimenting with new things, but we have no plans to offer a free streaming media service,&quot; she wrote in an e-mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oh, well.

(Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple is still fighting the case, in which it&#39;s accused of working with the publishers to raise prices for e-books. But all of the publishers settled out of court -- while denying wrongdoing -- which is why readers are starting to see some money now.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To be eligible for a credit, you must have bought a book published by Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster, Penguin or Macmillan between April 1, 2010 and May 21, 2012. You will not get a credit if you returned the book, Amazon notes in its FAQ on the credits. Other e-book sellers, such as Barnes &amp; Noble, Kobo, Google and Sony, are also set to return money, but Amazon is moving first.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chances are you won&#39;t be getting too much back -- the rate is $3.17 per any title that made it onto the New York Times bestsellers list, and 73 cents for other titles from the five publishers in question.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s hard to say how many e-book customers will receive a payment, since those eligible may have bought books from multiple places. The settlement applies to residents of 32 states. The total payout is expected to be $166 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140325ea3p005v5</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark18">National-Economy</a><a name="bookmark19">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon increases Prime’s cost as it turns focus to profit; It’s rare for Amazon to raise the cost of a product.

All Rights Reserved. The cost of convenience is going up.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon announced Thursday that it was raising the price of its Prime membership service by $20, to $99 a year, the first hike since the program was launched in 2005. Prime members — among the company&#39;s most loyal customers — receive free two-day shipping on select items and access to a library of instant, streaming video as well as books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The reaction to Amazon&#39;s decision is something of an experiment that the retail industry will watch closely. Will the e-commerce giant convince existing Prime customers — some of whom have a caffeine-like addiction to the service — that it&#39;s worth the higher price tag? Will it modify its services to offer shoppers more bang for their buck? Or will it alienate them as it turns its focus toward profitability? Its success or failure could prove a model to other retailers offering subscription services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Amazon&#39;s discussion board, customer angst was quickly apparent. &quot;I&#39;ll not be renewing my Prime. Not worth</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$99 a year for me. It&#39;s been fun, but fun and necessary are 2 different things,&quot; wrote one commenter named Tickled Dog.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It is something I&#39;m going to have to think hard about before I let it renew again,&quot; wrote another named Sorwen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It&#39;s rare for Amazon, which was founded by Washington Post owner Jeffrey P. Bezos and has been content to be a loss leader, to raise the cost of a product. But the company&#39;s shipping expenses have long eaten into its bottom line, analysts say. In fact, even increasing Prime&#39;s membership fees may not be enough to boost its profits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;While raising Prime pricing and pitching &#39;drone delivery&#39; solutions make good headlines, shipping losses remain a burden on profits,&quot; Colin Gillis, a technology analyst at BGC Partners, wrote in a research note Thursday. (Amazon said last year that it was developing drones to deliver packages in as little as 30 minutes.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In its fourth-quarter earnings report, Amazon posted a profit of $239 million, after two successive quarters of losses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The retailer said Prime has at least 20 million members, so a $20 price increase gives it about $400 million more to put toward infrastructure and content costs. Members make up about 45 percent of all Amazon customers and spend about twice as much, according to a report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a research firm.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The price hike is likely to make Prime customers spend even more to get their money&#39;s worth, said Josh Lowitz, the research firm&#39;s partner and co-founder.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This may dissuade some lower-value casual shoppers, but those who stay with it will have a subtle encouragement to spend more,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon hinted at a possible price increase in January, and on Thursday it reaffirmed that the logistical costs of Prime had forced its hand.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Even as fuel and transportation costs have increased, the price of Prime has remained the same. If you consider things like inflation and fuel costs, a Prime membership valued at $79 in 2005 would be worth more than $100 today,&quot; Amazon spokeswoman Julie Law said in an e-mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The extra revenue is also critical as the company builds out its range of in-house products, such as the Kindle line of e-readers and tablets, and ramps up its investment in original content to compete with streaming services such as Netflix.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaking of Netflix, Amazon is not the first major retailer to raise prices on a popular service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Netflix suddenly raised the cost of its video streaming service by about 60 percent in 2011, the company faced an instant backlash. More than 800,000 subscribers abandoned the site in a single quarter, forcing the company to restore its original fee. Wholesale giant Costco had a better result after it raised its membership fee by 10 percent in 2012, its first increase since 2007. Customers continued to shop there, and the company posted a profit the next year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s U.S. price hike follows a similar move in Europe this year, when the company increased membership costs by more than 60 percent for British and German customers, expanding its video offerings in the process.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:amrita.jayakumar@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">The retailer&#39;s stock price was flat Thursday at $371.51. </a><a href="mailto:hayley.tsukayama@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">amrita.jayakumar@washpost.com </a><a href="mailto:hayley.tsukayama@washpost.com" target="_blank">hayley.tsukayama@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140314ea3e000dx</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark20">the-switch</a><a name="bookmark21">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon raises Prime membership to $99 a year</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 433 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13 March 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

(Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prime customers got word of the price increase in an e-mail Thursday, explaining that the program has grown rapidly since it was introduced in 2005, and simply could not operate with a membership fee of $79 a year. The higher fee will be charged when users renew their memberships. New customers who sign up in the next seven days can lock in the annual $79 rate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Comparing Prime directly to other streaming video services, the price increase would make Prime more expensive than similar streaming products, such as Netflix and Hulu, which cost about $96 a year. But it&#39;s not quite an apples-to-apple comparison, given the shipping discounts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s rare for Amazon, which has been content to be a loss-leader, to raise the cost of a product. But the firm said that the logistical costs of Prime have forced its hand.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Even as fuel and transportation costs have increased, the price of Prime has remained the same for nine years,&quot; the e-mail message from the Prime team said. &quot;Since 2005, the number of items eligible for unlimited free</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two-Day Shipping has grown from one million to over 20 million. We also added unlimited access to over 40,000 movies and TV episodes with Prime Instant Video and a selection of over 500,000 books to borrow from the Kindle Owners&#39; Lending Library.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon confirmed last year that Prime has at least 20 million members, so a $20 price increase gives the company about $400 million more to put toward infrastructure and content costs. Both are critical as the company continues to build out its range of in-house products, such as the Kindle line of e-readers and tablets, and ramps up its investment in original content to compete with streaming services such as Netflix. There are also rumors that Amazon is looking into a low-cost game console and a streaming set-top box.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">And, of course, someone has to pay for that army of drones.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s recent decision to create an e-commerce storefront for 3D-printed products could finally bring 3D printing to the mainstream, but not in the way you might think.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you take a quick look at some of the nylon plastic products on offer via Amazon&#39;s partner, 3DLT, it&#39;s easy to come to the conclusion that the new pilot program is really just about an incremental e-commerce push at Amazon. In other words, Jeff Bezos now allows you to buy groovy new jewelry designs and quirky plastic toys made by 3D printers on Amazon.com rather than on a third-party site from Shapeways, Cubify or MakerBot. You&#39;ll now be able to pick up a designer $18.86 plastic belt buckle and $28.26 designer iPhone 5 case at Amazon.com along with your books and lawn products and fashion items and have it all delivered via Amazon Prime.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But is that all there is to it?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which opened a 3D Printer Store on its site to much acclaim in 2013, could be experimenting with a bigger concept: 3D printing is about changing the supply side of the retail business model as much as the demand side. In other words, 3D printing is not just about offering more and more consumer goods in more and more categories so that Amazon can make more and more money (although that is surely part of it). It could be that it&#39;s about transforming the online retail model based on our changing notions of scarcity -- scarcity of product as well as scarcity of shelf space in the digital world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the current retail model, Internet retailers such as Amazon stockpile products, store them in a warehouse, and then deliver them once a customer orders them as quickly and cheaply as possible. Amazon has an edge over traditional retailers (i.e. mom-and-pop book stores) because it can offer more products with nearly unlimited shelf space, thereby driving down the price of its products for consumers. Instead of spending money on costly</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">brick-and-mortar locations, Amazon can focus on increasing the efficiency of its warehouse operations in order to increase its margins on the sales of physical products.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the new model, though, 3D printing could be used to deliver a just-in-time retail experience, in which Amazon wouldn&#39;t need to maintain a network of warehouses around the country filled with products, and wouldn&#39;t need to invest in drones to deliver those products. Theoretically, one day Amazon might just sell the design file for a product, and the consumer would print the design file at home with a 3D printer in the comfort of his or her living room. Presumably, these consumers would also be purchasing their 3D printers and 3D printer filament from Amazon&#39;s 3D Printer Store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Which is why Amazon&#39;s new 3D printing pilot is so interesting. 3DLT, one of the five partners that Amazon has selected for the program, has hinted that the future is one in which users simply upload or download 3D design files and print them out with 3D printers. Everyday consumer products, in short, will eventually follow in the wake of plastic toys and plastic jewelry. In this radically new business model, Amazon would be selling the 3D design files and the 3D printers and the 3D printer filament, but wouldn&#39;t be selling actual &quot;products&quot; as we currently think about them. The consumers would print the products, not buy the products.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s a big idea.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We&#39;re still far away from that future in which products are sold as digital design files, of course. Today&#39;s reality is that you buy a $1,000 3D printer expecting to print light bulbs and tires, and end up printing goo. It still takes exceptional expertise to create 3D design files, and even a fair amount of patience and skill to learn how to use 3D printers. Moreover, until there is a wider variety of materials for 3D printers at a reasonable price point, it&#39;s</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">going to be a nylon plastic future for consumers for some time. And that&#39;s going to lead to new concerns that the future of 3D printing is just about printing lots and lots of plastic toys.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That being said, we&#39;re already starting to see increasingly creative and innovative ways that 3D printing is being used these days. We are 3D printing parts for airplanes and cars. We are 3D printing houses. We are 3D printing human body replacement parts. From that perspective, it&#39;s easy to see Amazon selling the design files for just about anything -- both organic and inorganic -- from an online storefront in the future. Just as Amazon transformed the retail shopping experience using the economies of scale made possible by the Internet, it may be able to use 3D printing to transform the retail shopping experience yet again.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As Amazon has moved into the original television business, the online retailer has made a great deal of the fact that, unlike its network competitors, it&#39;s showing audiences the pilots of the shows it&#39;s considering picking up and considering audiences&#39; reviews as part of its decision-making process. But when the company announced which of its second round of pilots would be moving forward to full series, it made one decision that seemed more attuned to critical opinion than pure public reaction. Among other shows, Amazon&#39;s moving forward with &quot;Transparent,&quot; a dark comedy from creator Jill Soloway about a Los Angeles family.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And not just any Los Angeles family. Jeffrey Tambor stars in the show as Mort, a transgender woman who&#39;s preparing to come out to her family, and who&#39;s spending time living in the gender identity she plans to transition to before having surgery to change her body. Transgender characters are exceptionally rare on television, and &quot;Transparent&quot; may well be the first American show to tackle this stage of gender transition. The show also breaks with another tradition in American pop culture. Rather than serving up Mort as a deviation from the norm from which the non-trans, heterosexual members of his family can learn and ultimately use as a spur to their growth, everyone in Mort&#39;s family is analyzing their own identity. Mort&#39;s daughter Sarah (Amy Landecker), who is married to a man, discovers Mort&#39;s plans during a tryst with one of her former lovers, a woman. And his younger children, Ali (Gaby Hoffmann, fresh off a revealing stint on Girls) and Josh (Jay Duplass) are struggling to determine who they are professionally and sexually after years of depending on Mort financially.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s no mistake that a family this complex is showing up in a comedy, rather than a drama. Amazon has picked up several hour-long shows, too. But in &quot;Transparent,&quot; it&#39;s recognizing a growing trend: If you want to tell a serious story about our culture, politics and sexuality, you have to get silly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seventeen years ago, when &quot;Oz&quot; premiered on HBO, it was a drama that provided television audiences with a serious look at the American prison system, with all of its gang dynamics, spiritual crises, fluid sexuality and class difference. Now, that slot&#39;s filled by a dramedy -- Netflix&#39;s &quot;Orange is the New Black,&quot; created by Jenji Kohan and based on Piper Kerman&#39;s memoir of the same name. The men of &quot;Oz&quot; were sometimes baroquely violent criminals and repulsive people made sympathetic by sensitive writing and carefully-developed relationships. But the women of &quot;Orange Is The New Black&quot; are largely non-violent offenders, incarcerated for frauds, drug offenses and crimes of passion. And the show, in between dance-offs and quests for a legendary chicken, raises serious questions about prison health care, support for former inmates as they&#39;re released back into the community and the training given to prison staff.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; is hardly the only comedy or show with humorous elements to steal a march on its dramatic, and supposedly more serious, predecessors. Dramas &quot;House of Cards&quot; and &quot;The Newsroom&quot; make a virtue of their cynicism, insisting, respectively, that pure ruthlessness and a willingness to stick it to corporate phonies are somehow missing from our political and media environments. If only, both shows insist, politicians and journalists were willing to just behave differently, it would be easier to make significant change. That&#39;s a shockingly naive view of Washington and of the media.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two comedies, HBO&#39;s &quot;Veep&quot; and NBC&#39;s &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; paint a much more complex portraits of American politics and the challenges of achieving substantive change through elected office and government bureaucracy. Vice President Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and civil-servant-turned-city-councilwoman Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) are both talented women whose personalities sometimes get the best of them: They can be bossy, self-absorbed and rude to people who disappoint them. But they&#39;re also working in environments where their talents aren&#39;t always an asset. Selina is a sharp-tongued woman in a job where she&#39;s only supposed to speak platitudes, while Leslie is a policy wonk whose proposals often put her out ahead of her Indiana</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">constituency. Both shows suggest that politics&#39; true problems are as silly as often as they are grand. But that doesn&#39;t make those problems any less maddening--just more difficult to transcend.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That willingness to acknowledge goofiness, confusion and spluttering frustration is also part of the comedies that aren&#39;t about policy or process, but simply about the parts of day-to-day life that are intensely political.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On FX&#39;s sitcom &quot;Louie,&quot; Louis C.K. struggles with how to explain racism to his young daughters, while also introducing them to his great aunt Ellen, who uses racist slang. Fox&#39;s &quot;Raising Hope,&quot; a portrait of a blue-collar family that&#39;s wrapping up its fourth and final season this spring, has captured everything from the characters&#39; joy in getting the education they missed out on to the delirium of a sugar rush from a wildly unbalanced diet. &quot;Looking,&quot; HBO&#39;s sitcom about young gay men in San Francisco, has conjured up a hilarious sketch of white liberal discomfort and guilt in the interracial relationship between Patrick (Jonathan Groff), a young, white, affluent video-game designer, and Richie (Ra l Castillo), his Latino hairstylist boyfriend. Even HBO&#39;s much-criticized &quot;Girls&quot; has taken a flaying knife to how the money that lets young women float aimlessly in New York gives them an excuse not to develop the social and professional skills that would allow them to become independent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is not to say that dramas can&#39;t thoughtfully explore political issues. The sweeping fantasy &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; may be treated like a genre trifle, but it&#39;s deeply engaged with what happens to a society that tolerates sexual violence and massive class stratifications. And CBS&#39;s &quot;The Good Wife&quot; is the first show to consider the challenges of technology policy and law in a sustained and sophisticated way. But many of their hour-long counterparts are so caught up in grisly crimes, troubled middle-aged men and grim portents that they&#39;re missing the rest of life. It&#39;s in comedies where the laughter keeps us clear-eyed enough to see what&#39;s happening around us.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140312ea3c006pt</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark26">CapitalBusiness</a><a name="bookmark27">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Job listings can give a clue of what&#39;s to come</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dan Beyers DanBeyers 386 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">10 March 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL A02</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Having panicky thoughts about Facebook potentially buying an army of drones? Stop. Breathe. And remember: All drones are not created equal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most people think of drones -- pardon, unmanned aerial systems -- and their military applications, but Facebook&#39;s possible acquisition and Amazon&#39;s plan to use them as our friendly neighborhood delivery bots stand as good reminders that there are many kinds of drones out there, and they&#39;re subject to different regulations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to TechCrunch, Facebook is looking to drones to help it fulfill its mission to wire the parts of the world that still aren&#39;t connected to the Internet -- the company has declined to comment on rumors or speculation. The unmanned systems in question are made by Titan Aerospace and are meant to fly way up in the atmosphere to provide Internet connections to rural or undeveloped areas. They can carry a payload of up to 25 pounds and can stay in the air for up to five years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By comparison, the &quot;octocopters&quot; that Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos has talked about are lighter and smaller and fly much, much lower. As you can probably guess from the name, they have eight rotors. While the Titan Aerospace drones can fly up to 65,000 feet, the delivery bots from the Amazon fleet are meant to zoom closer to a human scale and can go a distance of about 10 miles with a five-pound payload, as The Washington Post reported.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon faces regulatory restrictions to fly its UAS&#39;s -- because regulators will want to keep track of how all those copters zip over buildings and homes and set safety rules about what those drones can and cannot do. They&#39;ll also want to take precautions to make sure the drones aren&#39;t flying into things and are insulated against being taken over by hijackers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those regulatory concerns aren&#39;t quite as important to Titan Aerospace because its drones may fly above zones that the FAA regulates -- though launching them may be a more complicated regulatory issue, if done over the United States. Once they&#39;re up in the air, however, they could reach places that may not be regulated by the United States, said Cameron Cloar, an aviation litigation attorney at San Francisco&#39;s Nixon Peabody.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;These aircraft may present new regulatory issues for the FAA that it&#39;s not had to deal with before,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The FAA estimates that there will be 7,500 in the United States by 2018, but you shouldn&#39;t expect to see your pizza delivered by UAS any time soon. Cloar said that commercial use of drones in FAA space is farther down the agency&#39;s list of priorities, meaning ideas such as the plan that Amazon has posed or Nokia Here chief Christof Hellmis&#39;s dream of using mapping drones won&#39;t come to the United States until the government has gathered data from its UAS test site and opened airspace to the public sector for testing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For now, the FAA must approve commercial drone use on a case-by-case basis, as it did for ConocoPhillips last year to allow the firm to conduct research in the Arctic Circle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">(Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.)

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We&#39;ve all worked in companies with ugly cultures. Leaders bark orders and we are expected to blindly obey, even if it&#39;s the wrong decision for the consumer or the company. Most obey their marching orders, but some passionate employees propose creative solutions to problems, only to have their ideas ignored. &quot;Just do the job I hired you to do,&quot; they say. The frustration builds, stripping employees of their natural creativity. They become exasperated and stop caring.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many would describe this leadership style as militaristic. Conditioning people to be order-taking cogs may have seemed logical in the armed forces, but in today&#39;s fast moving, creative economy it hurts innovation and creativity. Perhaps our idea of militarist leadership is due for an update. Brig. Gen. Gregory Lengyel leads the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., and it&#39;s apparent he follows a completely different set of rules. He may not be creating the next hot start-up right now, but his creative leadership style fits into the playbook of Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hsieh is well-regarded for his unorthodox leadership that grew Zappos into a heavyweight in online commerce. The Zappos culture is second to none. If you&#39;ve ever spoken to a Zappos employee, it&#39;s evident they work someplace special.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are five Zappos Core Family Values Hsieh and Lengyel share:</p><ol id="l1"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Embrace and drive change</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Can you simply go to your boss with ideas and advice on how to fix problems or challenges in your organization? To many, this is laughable — companies don&#39;t operate this way and certainly not our our armed forces, yet at the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Air Force Academy the newest cadets voice is just as important as the highest ranking officers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lt. Col. Jay Tewksbury and Army Lt. Col. Rich Ramsey came to Lengyel with fundamental flaws they observed in the organization. They believed officers attitudes were causing an &quot;us vs. them mentality&quot; with new cadets, hurting productivity and undermining authority. They believed this resulted in new cadets bonding closely together as a unit against a shared common enemy, the upper class cadets, Lengyel and his staff. Instead of scolding these officers for questioning his leaders, Lengyel embraced their feedback and used it to drive change. Moving forward, instead of bearing down on cadets like prison guards, they trained officers to be mentors, teachers, and encouragers, giving fresh cadets the tools to become better. The division disappeared, and a sense of team was created.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Building open and honest relationships with communication</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Because I said so&quot; leadership may work for a child but it doesn&#39;t work with adults. In the Air Force it created frustration and confusion, resulting in more infractions and disdain for leadership. Lengyel&#39;s focus on open and honest communication meant his officers carefully explained why they focus on objectives and what they are aiming to accomplish. He combined their new sense of ownership with clear, written expectations so not only the cadets are held responsible, but their leaders.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Build a positive team and family spirit</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lengyel noticed the number of infractions and behavioral issues at the academy, many of which were alcohol related.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One reason was the demand the academy placed on cadets&#39; weekends, limiting social time normally crucial for relationship building. This resulted in cadets drinking a few weekends&#39; worth of beer in one evening, knowing they wouldn&#39;t get the chance for another month. Instead of responding with stricter discipline, Lengyel asked his officers if weekend activities could be combined or streamlined, giving his cadets more free time. They were able to do more with less, opening up more free time. Infractions dropping by over 40 percent since the changes, according to Lengyel. By responding with empathy, Lengyel created a family spirit, allowing cadets to feel they were appreciated.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Be passionate and determined</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cadets come to the Air Force because they are passionate about serving their country. But the culture of compliance tends to suck that passion out of them in an instant. Realizing this strips a cadet of strong intrinsic motivators, Lengyel and his officers take a different approach. After clearly communicating objectives and goals to achieve, Lengyel and his officers take a step back, turning responsibility over to the cadet. Lengyel loosens the screws instead of tightening them and this new freedom effectively utilizes cadets natural passion, inspiring achievement far beyond acts done out of compliance.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Be humble</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;m not -- by far -- the smartest guy on my team&quot; Lengyel says. &quot;My team has done a wonderful job, in many cases they come up with better solutions than I would have.&quot; By listening, empathizing and trusting his team, he has allowed a creative culture to thrive. Lengyel doesn&#39;t think his leadership style is all that unique and sees it as common sense. He is quick to cite the leaders that have mentored him. But still, it&#39;s not easy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stepping back to give cadets ownership is a scary thing, especially when so much is on the line. Lengyel and his staff are quick to step in to prevent injury or anything illegal, but that rarely happens. Instead, cadets seem to self-correct. Part of the process is giving space for failure, so it doesn&#39;t happen when lives are on the line.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Whether you&#39;re selling shoes, leading a billion dollar organization, or commanding troops, these five lessons are crucial today. Millennials bring passion and creativity to the workforce, but militaristic leadership isn&#39;t the answer, not even for the military itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Many organizations give their staff responsibility, but few give staff the authority,&quot; Lengyel says. Giving his cadets authority, means they take ownership and with ownership comes commitment. &quot;I don&#39;t want compliance,&quot; Lengyel said. &quot;I want commitment.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Brady is a writer and speaker focused on cultivating creativity.

Here&#39;s how those stats compare to other criminals, prominent people, and enterprises:</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sinaloa earns about $3 billion in annual revenue. That&#39;s about how much Atlantic City casinos netted in 2012. It&#39;s also the estimated annual revenue of Amazon Web Services. Forbes ranked Guzman the 67th most powerful person in the world in 2013, one spot behind House Speaker John Boehner and one spot ahead of New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson. The State Department offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Guzman&#39;s arrest. The same reward is being offered for suspects connected with the U.S.S. Cole bombing, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the highjacking of TWA Flight 847 and several al-Qaeda operatives. Chicago prosecutors branded Guzman &quot;public enemy No. 1,&quot; the first person called that since Al Capone. With Guzman off the streets, a handful of people are primed to succeed him as the most-wanted drug lord.

But why?</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 715 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 February 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has acquired gaming studio Double Helix, resparking rumors that the tech giant is looking to step more fully into the world of video games.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Double Helix is best known for producing the Xbox One launch game &quot;Killer Instinct,&quot; and is based in Irvine, Calif. Its games are not the sort of mobile games that Amazon already offers for its own tablets. Double Helix makes titles more suited to the computer — or to the console.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several media reports confirmed the acquisition, which was originally reported by TechCrunch. In a statement on Thursday, Amazon said it &quot;has acquired Double Helix as part of our ongoing commitment to build innovative games for customers.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The acquisition comes just a week after gaming Web site VG24/7 reported that Amazon is working on an</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Android-based console, citing unnamed sources who said the new piece of hardware will retail for less than $300.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s not the first time that Amazon&#39;s name has been linked with games. The company already has a development wing called Amazon Game Studios, which currently offers one game: the Android-based &quot;Air Patriots,&quot; made for its Kindle line of tablets and other Android devices. With the addition of Double Helix, however, the game effort could take on a whole new spin.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There&#39;s certainly space in the gaming world for another player — one who appeals to those between the hard-core gamers on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and the more casual gamers on smartphones and tablets. Others have tried to step into that space, most notably Ouya, a Kickstarter-backed independent console that starts at $99. (Ouya also recently released a new console that comes with double the memory for $129.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One reason why Ouya and others have thus far failed to grab a substantial piece of the market, is that they haven&#39;t had broad developer support. It&#39;s actually a quandary that a lot of new entrants face in any software market. It&#39;s hard to attract developers unless you can prove the customers are there. And it&#39;s hard to attract customers if you can&#39;t promise them that there will be good software — in this case, games — for them to enjoy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But if Amazon&#39;s taking the sector seriously, it could get around that problem by simply buying up the credibility it needs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After all, it&#39;s something they&#39;ve tried before, with some pretty good success. The company&#39;s work on Amazon Studios — its original series division — shows that it&#39;s not afraid to throw money at content.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Thursday, Amazon debuted a second wave of original pilots for its Amazon Prime service, which has already launched successful shows including Gary Trudeau&#39;s &quot;Alpha House&quot; and another original series, &quot;Betas.&quot; It&#39;s not a perfect parallel, since a developer such as Double Helix would likely want to produce in-house games rather than take submissions from others. But if Amazon shows the same willingness to fully invest in games that it has with its shows, its brand alone could easily attract talent from the gaming world on a higher level.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As for the hardware itself, it may not make a whole lot of sense for Amazon to release a dedicated gaming console. But modern consoles aren&#39;t just for gaming. They rely on other content, mostly streaming video of the kind Amazon&#39;s own Prime Video service provides. Rumors that Amazon&#39;s been planning a set-top box stretch back years. If those rumors are true, then it&#39;s not crazy to think that such a device would also include access to high-quality, downloadable or streaming games.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And if Amazon packaged all that together and priced it more like it has its Kindle line?

Verizon quickly denied the complaint, saying it continues to treat all traffic equally.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Raphael, a software engineer for the cloud-based security firm iScan Online, said he was first alerted to the problem on Jan. 26 when the president of his company complained of &quot;major slowdowns&quot; while using iScan remotely. After determining that nothing was amiss with iScan&#39;s product, Raphael returned home to find that his own connection to Amazon Web Services — on which iScan runs — had been degraded.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Connections to AWS were limited to 40 kBps, Raphael said — about 240 times slower than the 75 Mbps fiber optic connection Raphael was paying for. Raphael discovered that even content hosted on AWS by others, including Netflix, was also slower.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This scenario is impacting different AWS folks,&quot; he said in an interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thinking the error could be part of a wider phenomenon, Raphael said he tried loading the same content as though he were in the office by &quot;remoting&quot; in. The office connection was normal, at 5,000 kBps. So the problem appeared limited to Raphael&#39;s home and that of iScan&#39;s president — both of which are on Verizon FiOS.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Raphael contacted Verizon about the issue, a customer representative acknowledged that Verizon was &quot;limiting bandwidth to cloud providers&quot;:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s worth treating the rep&#39;s statement with a great deal of skepticism; the chances that this one person is completely aware of everything the company is doing seems pretty remote. Still, this was after the representative asked Raphael to perform various diagnostic tests, including a speed test using Verizon&#39;s own software, which showed Raphael&#39;s service was otherwise running normally at 75 Mbps.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We tested some Google downloads and tested downloading SketchUp [a form of 3D design software],&quot; said Raphael. Everything seemed to perform smoothly; only AWS loaded slowly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An AWS spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a statement to the Washington Post, Verizon said it was investigating the report and that the customer rep was misinformed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We treat all traffic equally, and that has not changed,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Many factors can affect the speed of a customer&#39;s experience for a specific site, including that site&#39;s servers, the way the traffic is routed over the Internet and other considerations. We are looking into this specific matter, but the company representative was mistaken. We&#39;re going to redouble our representative education efforts on this topic.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under the Federal Communications Commission&#39;s net neutrality rules, broadband companies were forbidden from slowing down or blocking connections to content. That prohibition was struck by the D.C. Circuit court last month, enabling companies to legally throttle service if they chose. Verizon suggested in oral argument last fall that it was interested in different service models.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements,&quot; said Verizon&#39;s lawyer, Helgi Walker.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The FCC has said it intends to seek other ways to help keep the Internet open.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both the report and the denial leave us in a pretty murky situation. Since I&#39;m a FiOS subscriber, you can be sure I&#39;ll be testing this myself from home tonight.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140205ea25005pl</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark42">reliable-source</a><a name="bookmark43">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Marion Barry&#39;s autobiography promises &quot;full story&quot; ; The four-term mayor promises the “full” story of his life... including the night of his infamous crack bust.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Emily Heil 293 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 February 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

So why is its price probably going up rather than down?</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Andrea Peterson 720 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 February 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During an earnings call Thursday, Amazon said it was looking into bumping up the price of Amazon Prime by 20 or 40 bucks. The Prime service currently charges a flat $79 for a year of all-you-can-ship service on millions of items.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But despite staying at the same price point since its launch in 2005, Prime has been pretty lucrative for Amazon -- in fact, some research shows Prime subscribers spend twice as much on the online shopping site as non-Prime shoppers. So why is Amazon considering raising barriers to joining rather than lowering them? Because one of the psychological factors for why Prime customers spend so much is they want to make sure they get their money&#39;s worth from the upfront subscription cost.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Though expensive for the Company in the short-term, it&#39;s a significant benefit and more convenient for customers,&quot; said Amazon CEO (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos in a press release announcing the service. &quot;With Amazon Prime, there&#39;s no minimum purchase to think about, and no consolidating orders -- two-day shipping becomes an everyday experience rather than an occasional indulgence.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And what started as a risky endeavor has been remarkably successful at getting consumers to change their shopping habits. Plus, in the near-decade since it launched, Amazon has added on new perks to attract subscribers, like Amazon Instant Video, and a e-book lending library for its Kindle e-reader line, as well as offered discounted or special versions aimed at students and (real or fake) moms.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At first glance, it might seem pretty amazing that the service managed to hold steady at the same price for that long while adding new services -- the licensing for content for the e-book and video services aren&#39;t free, after all. But Prime is actually a pretty lucrative proposition for Amazon. According to a Bloomberg Business Week story from 2010, the service &quot;broke even in just three months, not the two years the team had originally forecast.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While the company has been notoriously tight-lipped about the total number of subscribers, statements suggest at least 20 million people have signed up for Prime. And those 20 million people spend a lot more money at Amazon than non-subscribers: A report from market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners found that Prime customers spent an average of $1,340 per year with Amazon versus non-Prime shopper who spent $650 annually.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Statistics like that have led some to suggest Amazon should consider actually cutting the price -- or giving it away for free. So why is Amazon considering raising the price?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the earnings call, Amazon cited higher fuel and shipping costs. But there&#39;s also consumer behavior that will likely keep Prime a premium package. Right now, when they sign up, consumers are betting that the the savings they reap in shipping costs and possibly subbing Amazon Instant for Netflix or Hulu will outweigh the cost of subscribing. In that calculus, even a $40 dollar bump to Prime subscription fees, which would be a 50 percent price increase, might not seem unreasonable to current subscribers when you consider that Netflix alone will run you $96 per year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And, as suggested by the spending habits of Prime versus non-Prime shoppers, subscribers may feel compelled to use Amazon for as many of their day to day or online purchases as possible to make sure they&#39;re getting the most out of their investment: Why leave your house when you can get something delivered to your door? And why shop anywhere else when you can get it delivered fast, for free, from Amazon? It&#39;s this conditioning that makes Prime so effective.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And if the company is confident it can convince consumers $120 per year is still a good deal for Prime, it&#39;s hardly surprising that Amazon is considering changing the price. After all, given the at least 20 million subscribers, a $40 increase could also translate into $800,000,000 in revenue for Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is the owner of the Washington Post.

Are other retailers doomed?</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Lydia DePillis 647 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">31 January 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A couple weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal happened upon a 27-page patent for what Amazon.com calls &quot;anticipatory&quot; or &quot;speculative&quot; shipping, which sounds insane.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here&#39;s how it works, in a nutshell: The company crunches its streams of data to forecast generally where a certain item might be wanted, sends it on its way, and remotely directs it to the right address as soon as someone actually orders it. On the off chance that the item doesn&#39;t actually get ordered, Amazon might discount it to the person at the place it arrived, or even give it away for free. It&#39;s all based on probabilities: What people are likely to want at what time, based on user signals like wish lists and past purchases, and the cost/benefit calculus of time saved vs. packages erroneously delivered.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If it all works according to plan, Amazon will eat away at one of the last reasons people still go to brick and mortar stores: Immediacy. It might not be able to deliver something to you as fast as you think it, but it could get darn close. As Techcrunch points out, widespread speculative shipping could function like electrical utilities use predictive demand management to send power back and forth across the grid.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We shouldn&#39;t, though, expect other retailers to lie down and let Amazon become a utility-like monopoly. Wal-Mart is hot on its heels, and the rest of the industry is scrambling to keep up. In their struggle against the Seattle-based empire, retailers are discovering that their physical locations -- increasingly thought of as useless overhead -- are a key advantage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Retail storefronts, after all, are the original hubs for data on what customers want. And big retailers are very familiar with adaptive stocking: Certain branches of different grocery stores offer different items based on the demographics around them (Goya Foods, for example, helps grocery stores understand what Latino nationalities live in the area and what they eat). They stock for the weather, big sporting events, holidays and weird food trends. Now, since more retailers are able to ship from their stores, many -- from Footlocker to Dick&#39;s Sporting Goods -- have a network of warehouses and delivery hubs that Amazon&#39;s now building from scratch.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;re trying to do what stores can do intuitively,&quot; says one retail logistics professional who asked to stay anonymous because he&#39;s not authorized to speak publicly. Think about it like this: Brick-and-mortar retailers actually have two points of sale. They can sell something off the shelf or mail it to someone nearby. That creates more flexibility in the amount of inventory they can stock, alleviating the problem of empty racks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;ll throw something into a store to create more panache,&quot; the logistics expert says. &quot;They&#39;re not going to sell it, but they can ship it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No matter who comes out on top in the retail wars, the real winners are the people doing the shipping: Amazon&#39;s patent provides for working through a contracted &quot;common carrier,&quot; like FedEx or UPS. Other services, such as the find-you-where-you-are eBay Now, employ people in cars to shuttle things around from retailers to people willing to pay $5 for almost-instant gratification. As the shipping pileup over Christmas demonstrated, when lots more people are ordering lots more things online, the existing distribution network just doesn&#39;t cut it. And sure, that last-mile delivery might be accomplished with drones, but people are still in the picture for now.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s going to be a huge courier network that&#39;s going to develop from a society that wants everything right away,&quot; the logistics expert said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just like Google autocompletes our search requests, the biggest tech companies appear to be looking to autocomplete our thoughts and actions in ways that almost seem like science fiction. It&#39;s not just that companies such as Amazon and Google know what your tastes and preferences are, they are now able to act on them in the real world by delivering real products and services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consider, for example, that Amazon received a patent in December for something called &quot;anticipatory shipping.&quot; In short, Amazon figures out that you&#39;ve been looking at an item on its Web site and already starts the shipping process so that the item will arrive at your door perhaps hours after you&#39;ve actually added it to your shopping cart and clicked &quot;buy.&quot; (Or, in a really futuristic concept, it might actually arrive before you click buy, if you&#39;re the type of person who lingers for hours over customer reviews.) It&#39;s all part of removing one of the pain points of the online shopping process -- the long wait between the time you buy and the time you receive the actual product. If Amazon&#39;s right, then the whole &quot;pre-shipment&quot; concept could be even more revolutionary than the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">delivery-by-drones concept.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Or, consider that Google has patented a geolocation technology for linking ads to free or discounted taxi rides to a restaurant, shop or entertainment venue that advertises on Google. Consider the following hypothetical: You&#39;re thinking of going to a restaurant, but it&#39;s raining outside, so you decide to just order take-out -- but then you notice an ad on Google for a free taxi ride to a nearby restaurant. Would you go? This concept, of course, is even more relevant, given that Google has invested in Uber and has pioneered the concept of the autonomous car. Now you can imagine this patented technology being used by Google to deliver Uber rides or driverless cars to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">restaurant-goers and shoppers. Once Google has your location, it can start offering specific services tailored to your GPS coordinates.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All of this goes way beyond what we thought was the future just a few years ago -- the &quot;semantic Web.&quot; According to the earliest conceptions of the semantic Web, it would soon be possible to know enough about you to deliver the right content at the right time to the right user, thanks to the ability for all data across the Web to &quot;talk&quot; to each other. Tim Berners-Lee has referred to this as the &quot;next Web&quot; and some have called it &quot;Web 3.0.&quot; In our everyday lives, this dream of data talking to each other has already come true. We now have relevant banner ads displayed right next to the text we&#39;re reading, curiously creepy e-mails that seem to know what we&#39;ve been reading and talking about, and the whole genre of &quot;social ads,&quot; where your friends appear to be endorsing specific products and services on Facebook.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While some of this new technology sounds gloriously disruptive, it also holds the potential for a lot of misunderstandings. In many ways, it seems like &quot;Minority Report&quot; and the concept of &quot;pre-crime.&quot; In the Tom Cruise movie, a man is wrongly suspected of a &quot;pre-crime&quot; and has no way to prove his innocence of something he has never done (or plans to do). In your everyday life, of course, you wouldn&#39;t be accused of a pre-crime -- but you might find your front porch piling up with boxes of items you never intended to order, or cars parked outside of your house, engines idling, just waiting to take you for a ride.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What&#39;s interesting about all of this &quot;autocomplete&quot; business is that the most valuable Internet companies will be those that can act on our lives in the real world by delivering physical products and services. It&#39;s a lot more valuable to know that someone enjoys a certain type of book and then ships that book to a person than it is to use that knowledge just to throw up some social ads about new book releases. That might place pressure on a company such as Facebook -- which already knows so much about our everyday connections -- to start acquiring companies that can offer what Amazon and Google promise to be able to do one day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140128ea1s0030d</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 2 end/Image_010.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark50">ezra-klein</a><a name="bookmark51">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Retail in the age of Amazon: Scenes from an industry running scared</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Lydia DePillis 1,932 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">21 January 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

The enigmatic title: &quot;Even Amazon Can&#39;t Do This Yet.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If you don&#39;t think Amazon is a problem for your business, I don&#39;t care where you are in the world, you are wrong, you are living under a rock. It&#39;s time to come out,&quot; declared consultant Lee Peterson of WD Partners, to an auditorium so packed that people were standing at the back and sitting in the aisles. &quot;The very concept of online shopping has become synonymous with Amazon.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They listened carefully as Peterson laid out the problem, raising camera phones in unison to capture the slides he presented about a customer base that sees little need to frequent physical stores anymore, ever since the advent of Amazon Prime. And it wasn&#39;t just that session: Just like much of the Consumer Electronics Show revolves around Apple&#39;s products even though the company stopped attending years ago, the chatter at the retail extravaganza all responded to the Seattle company&#39;s seismic influence. Since coming onto the scene about a decade ago, Amazon has rapidly turned from an online bookseller into a tentacular behemoth that sells anything and everything cheaper than the companies that produce it, laying waste to everyone else&#39;s profit margins. And the retail world is still desperately seeking solutions. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The elephant in the room is Amazon apparently doesn&#39;t need to make a profit, where other retailers do,&quot; said Hamish Brewer, chief executive of JDA Software, in a keynote panel on Sunday. The room curdled, as if Brewer had uttered something unfit for polite company, but Brewer forged ahead. &quot;If you&#39;re going to chase Amazon on price only, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to be a successful strategy. We have to as retailers develop strengths that Amazon doesn&#39;t have.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retail service industry has gone into overdrive trying to give retailers new ways to fight back. At the convention, flocks of Brazilians and European executives in tailored suits milled about in two giant expo halls, peering at the latest grocery checkout stands and interactive digital signage; tech companies hawked their analytics platforms with the help of pop-ups by Momofuku Milk Bar and Godiva Chocolate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The good news, for them: The playing field is starting to level up. A few years of overhauling technological infrastructure and rethinking distribution is turning traditional retailers into the kinds of entities that have a chance to survive in the new world Amazon has created. The bad news is that they&#39;re not focusing on the one thing Peterson pointed out that Amazon doesn&#39;t do well: interaction with actual people in actual stores that have traditionally been better at selling merchandise than any newfangled technology could ever manage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="16" height="1" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 2 end/Image_011.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you really want to claw back some market power in the age of Amazon, you need to do a few things: Let your customers discover, purchase and have your products delivered anywhere they please. Make your physical stores into interactive fun zones. And, meanwhile, learn as much about the people buying from you as possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That overall approach can be encapsulated in one easy buzzword: &quot;Omnichannelization&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Amazon response&quot;).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s break that down. &quot;Channels&quot; are the ways in which retailers communicate with their customers, from their storefronts to their Web sites to their mobile applications. &quot;Omni&quot; means that you have to use all of them and that consumers need to be able to switch among them, ordering something online to pick up in a store, finding something in a store and getting it delivered to their home, whenever they want -- the only way to compete against a company that makes buying everything as easy as one click.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;From our perspective, it just means additional complexity,&quot; says David Telford, director of market development with QlikView, one of the hundreds of data companies that have sprung up to help retailers manage the nightmarish logistical challenge that kind of universal availability presents. One of the biggest: eBay, another purely online company that has developed an enterprise arm to manage ordering and deliveries for companies that don&#39;t feel up to the task.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re the anti-Amazon,&quot; explains Ted McCaffrey, the eBay division&#39;s director of sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Much of the change has happened behind the scenes, as retailers start turning their physical stores into warehouses that can respond much more quickly to online ordering. A whole lot of it hasn&#39;t hit the street yet -- and could totally upend the consumer experience when it finally does.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tata Consultancy Services, for example, presented a &quot;shoppable window&quot; with special glass that allows passersby to browse through goods for sale even while the store is closed. A startup called Beehivr builds apps using Apple&#39;s Beacon technology to guide people through a store, sending notifications based on whether they&#39;re in the dress section or the shoe aisle. A new kind of &quot;digital watermark&quot; can be implanted in everything from product packaging to magazine ads and even the audio of a soundtrack playing overhead, allowing retailers to broadcast information to anybody who can be taught that the information is all around them -- if only they would download the app that decodes it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s one of the biggest X factors in all these new strategies meant to make shopping easier than breathing: Will people actually use them?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Take a brand-new technology by Los Angeles-based startup Actv8.me, which has developed a way for television commercials to push alerts to a viewer&#39;s phone about the clothing everyone on a show is wearing, or even send coupons for the products in an advertisement. All of it can be personalized, as the networks learn more about the preferences of who&#39;s in front of the TV. When it goes live this fall, the program could solve a huge problem for broadcasters: getting people to actually watch the advertisements that generate their revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It only works, though, if viewers can be taught what&#39;s going on. &quot;You just hope that consumers understand it,&quot; said Actv8 CEO Brian Shuster, when asked what he worries about most with the program. &quot;And if we make it simple enough, they will.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Those are the new technologies that seem to have real potential. Sometimes, the aspirations for omnichannel retailing seem more akin to fantasy than mere magic -- with limited real-world utility.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IBM, for example, had a set of virtual reality glasses that allow shoppers to wander through a store as if in a video game, picking up &quot;coins&quot; to redeem for discounts. Taking it one step further, the Indian technology company Wipro showcased a 3-D &quot;virtual shopping&quot; app that allows you to &quot;walk&quot; through a &quot;store&quot; without even leaving your living room, browsing items without the bother of crowds. In the future, haptic technology could even create the sensation of lifting something up to examine it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It might seem odd that someone would choose to simulate a shopping experience remotely rather than either going to a physical store or buying from a typical retail Web site, but salesman Ramakrishna Kashikar argued that video game culture is so pervasive now that there&#39;s no telling how far consumers might want to take it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The world has become so virtual,&quot; he said. &quot;Even Amazon has to do this kind of thing, or else they&#39;re going to be wiped out.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="16" height="1" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 2 end/Image_012.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The flip side of all of this: Letting consumers access goods electronically allows companies to learn everything there is to know about your relationship with them, and leverage it to sell you more. &quot;Loyalty&quot; programs are ubiquitous now, but they&#39;re not just a consumer convenience -- they&#39;re also a way for companies to anticipate your needs. Think about going to get a sandwich at Quiznos, and because the store recognizes an app on your phone as you walk through the door, the person behind the counter already knows you like American cheese and no tomatoes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introducing that level of panoptical intelligence into the customer relationship must be done delicately. A small company that develops customer management software for mid-sized retail operations, Springboard Retail, showed off what a sales associate could know about customer &quot;Albin Douglas&quot; when he walks in a store. Since Douglas has bought mostly blue shirts in the past, the associate could recommend a new selection of blue shirts that just went on sale. It&#39;s all in the interest of making the in-store experience just as intelligent as the online one.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;A lot of people predicted that brick-and-mortar would go away. We&#39;re trying to help them rebuild those relationships,&quot; explains Springboard&#39;s Allen Williams. But isn&#39;t it possible that customers might be more creeped out by people knowing things about them that they used to entrust only to a computer? &quot;They kind of will be, I think,&quot; Williams acknowledged.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Springboard may have the right idea, as consumers get more used to the reality that companies are tracking them everywhere, to put that knowledge in the hands of actual people, who can use it to re-create a sense of community that&#39;s been lost in the digital age.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Indeed, that was the answer to the question that drew so many convention-goers to Lee Peterson&#39;s session on how to beat Amazon. He presented the results of a large survey that showed that consumers find dealing with sales people more frustrating than satisfying, even though face-to-face interaction is the one thing Amazon can&#39;t offer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;To me, that&#39;s a travesty,&quot; Peterson said. &quot;If you&#39;re worried about defeating Amazon, I think this is number one. Invest in people. Hire people who like people. Retail is like having a party in your house every day.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rest of the convention, though, seemed to be going in the opposite direction. Most of the innovations on display focused on how to take people out of the process, including: huge vending machines that sell everything from hot meals to Kindles; lockers where you can pick up whatever you&#39;ve ordered to be delivered to them (eliminating the need for keeping pharmacists on duty round-the-clock, for example); and battery-powered price tags that can be manipulated from a central computer, rather than having someone spend hours changing them one by one.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the few attempts to put people back in the process came from a three-year-old company called Needle, which recruits &quot;brand advocates&quot; to answer questions about products online for $10 to $12 an hour, with the chance to earn a more flexible schedule or free products for good performance. The company had a whole corner of the convention floor, where three live &quot;advocates&quot; -- a part-time student, a stay-at-home mom, a freelance photographer -- sat in chairs in front of a giant shrink-wrapped camper van doing their jobs, chatting away with customers for the companies they represent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In another time, they might have dealt with the shopper face to face. In the future, it&#39;s as personal as most shopping is likely to get.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document WPCOM00020140115ea1f004mt</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark52">the-switch</a><a name="bookmark53">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is a hornet&#39;s nest of malware ; Four of the Web’s top 10 malware sites live on Amazon cloud services.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Brian Fung 413 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16 January 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s cloud computing service plays host to some of the most prolific malware distributors on the Internet, security researchers have discovered.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Of the 10 sites that pump out malware most frequently, four are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) — including the number one site, download-instantly.com, according to a threat report published Wednesday by the IT security firm Solutionary.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The report comes a week after we learned that hackers allegedly used Amazon&#39;s cloud hosting solution as a platform for a botnet that scraped personal information from potentially millions of LinkedIn subscribers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloud computing is becoming an attractive way for online criminals to launch attacks against businesses and consumers because of its low cost. It allows users to instantly set up an array of virtual servers that can be ordered to perform both legitimate and abusive functions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Together, the four Amazon-hosted sites accounted for 6 percent of all malware Solutionary found in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the report. Amazon (whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post) is the leading malware host among global hosting providers, followed closely by GoDaddy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The e-commerce giant has taken an active stance on its abusive customers. In 2009, after reports surfaced of a botnet controller living on AWS, the company said it had located the offending malware and shut it down. Amazon also operates an e-mail hotline dedicated to handling reports of AWS abuse.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But that hasn&#39;t stopped cybercriminals from taking advantage of Amazon&#39;s cloud service. In a 2009 presentation at the Black Hat security conference, one consultant demonstrated how AWS&#39;s massive computing power could be used as a super-powered password cracker. A typical eight-character alphanumeric password might cost as little as $45 to crack. More recently, AWS was found to be hosting SpyEye, a trojan that let hackers gain access to the online accounts of banking customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has argued that it&#39;s much better to find the malware on its own systems, where it can be cordoned off and eliminated, rather than have it hosted on the servers of other, less responsive companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We take security very seriously, and investigate all reported vulnerabilities,&quot; the company writes on its threat reporting page.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">A spokesperson for AWS did not return a request for comment Wednesday.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Carol Petraitis, an instructional assistant at Calvert Country School, decided that making books about her students was a good way to get their creativity flowing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unlike most public schools, Calvert Country in Prince Frederick provides individualized learning programs for children with special needs in connection with behavior, autism and functional skills.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With encouragement from colleagues, Petraitis published one of her books on Amazon and is donating proceeds to the Autism Project, a nonprofit program in Owings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It wasn&#39;t meant to be a professional thing. It was just something we wanted to do,&quot; Petraitis said of herself and colleague Candice Sison, who illustrated the book.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The book is &quot;really just a cute little story,&quot; Petraitis said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the summer, when Petraitis talked to her students about the 17-year return of the cicadas - winged insects that live most of their lives underground - most did not know what a cicada was. To educate her students in an interactive way, Petraitis wrote a story about cicadas, with her students&#39; names included in the pages, and read it to the class.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Cindy the Cicada&quot; is about a cicada&#39;s journey to find a mate and a home to lay her eggs, Petraitis said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Along with Sison, Petraitis wrote the story based on the life cycle of a cicada. The goal of the book was to hone students&#39; &quot;tremendous imaginations,&quot; involve them in the story and make learning fun, Sison said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As Sison and Petraitis re-read the story in December to students Cameron Vinson, 10, Noah Wainwright, 9, and Dorian Sprague, 7, Cameron wasn&#39;t ready for the story to end.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I want a sequel,&quot; Cameron said, adding that he wanted to know what was going to happen to Cindy next.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Students with special needs often benefit from having stories read to them repeatedly, in addition to hearing their own names, which directly involves them in the story. Sison said the repetition helps the students retain the information.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Petraitis has seen this technique work before with two other books she wrote for her students, one about the Earth&#39;s continents and one about the planets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I just love . . . to see those small milestones,&quot; Petraitis said. &quot;If it takes a story with a couple of pictures [for that to happen], I&#39;m more than happy to do it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Petraitis said she contacted another publishing company that wanted $3,395 to publish the small book, which neither Petraitis nor Sison wanted to do. When Petraitis went to Amazon, the company asked for $700. The book was published in October.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">&quot;I paid for it to be published and wanted to give something back to the Autism Project,&quot; Petraitis said. The book is available at Amazon.com for $8.99 in paperback and $4.99 for the Kindle edition.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Originally from Brooklyn, N.Y., Petraitis has lived in Calvert for 17 years. She and Sison, a native of Calvert, have been instructional assistants at Calvert Country School for three years. Both plan to write more books together to use in the classroom.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">WP20140109sm-gazpetraitis0109 Document WP00000020140109ea1900049</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 2 end/Image_013.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark56">on-leadership</a><a name="bookmark57">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Zappos says goodbye to bosses</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Jena McGregor 901 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8 January 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Online retailer Zappos has long been known to do things its own way. The customer-service obsessed company calls its executives &quot;monkeys,&quot; has staffers ring cowbells to greet guests, and offers new employees cash to quit as a way to test their loyalty.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Las Vegas-based retailer is now going even more radical, introducing a new approach to organizing the company. It will eliminate traditional managers, do away with the typical corporate hierarchy and get rid of job titles, at least internally. The company told employees of the change at a year-end meeting, Quartz first reported.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The unusual approach is called a &quot;holacracy.&quot; Developed by a former software entrepreneur, the idea is to replace the traditional corporate chain of command with a series of overlapping, self-governing &quot;circles.&quot; In theory, this gives employees more of a voice in the way the company is run.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to Zappos executives, the move is an effort to keep the 1,500-person company from becoming too rigid, too unwieldy and too bureaucratic as it grows.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;As we scaled, we noticed that the bureaucracy we were all used to was getting in the way of adaptability,&quot; says Zappos&#39;s John Bunch, who is helping lead the transition to the new structure. The company has become a force in online shopping as it expanded beyond shoes into apparel, housewares and cosmetics. Amazon, which acquired it in 2009 for $1.2 billion but allows it to be run as a mostly independent unit, does not break out sales for Zappos.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The holacracy concept is the brainchild of management consultant Brian Robertson, a serial software entrepreneur who says he launched the idea after realizing he was &quot;more interested in how we worked together&quot; than in his own job. The concept has a couple of high-profile devotees — Twitter cofounder Evan Williams uses it at his new company, Medium, and time management guru David Allen uses it run his firm — but Zappos is by far the largest company to adopt the idea.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At its core, a holacracy aims to organize a company around the work that needs to be done instead of around the people who do it. As a result, employees do not have job titles. They are typically assigned to several roles that have explicit expectations. Rather than working on a single team, employees are usually part of multiple circles that each perform certain functions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition, there are no managers in the classically defined sense. Instead, there are people known as &quot;lead links&quot; who have the ability to assign employees to roles or remove them from them, but who are not in a position to actually tell people what to do. Decisions about what each role entails and how various teams should function are instead made by a governing process of people from each circle. Bunch does note, however, that at Zappos the broadest circles can to some extent tell sub-groups what they&#39;re accountable for doing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zappos and Robertson are careful to note that while a holacracy may get rid of traditional managers (those who both manage others&#39; work and hold the keys to their career success), there is still structure and employees&#39; work is still watched. Poor performers, Robertson says, stand out when they don&#39;t have enough &quot;roles&quot; to fill their time, or when a group of employees charged with monitoring the company&#39;s culture decide they&#39;re not a good fit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bunch, meanwhile, says that while people have latched on to the idea that Zappos is getting rid of managers, what the company is actually doing is &quot;decoupling the professional development side of the business from the technical getting-the-work-done side.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both also say that while the system lacks traditional managers, it does not mean that leaders won&#39;t emerge. If anything, the goal is to get more people to take charge.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, truly stamping out the corporate hierarchy may be much more difficult than it seems. Bob Sutton, a professor at Stanford&#39;s Graduate School of Business and author of the forthcoming book &quot;Scaling Up Excellence&quot;, says &quot;show me any group of five human beings or five apes or five dogs, and I want to see the one where a status difference does not emerge. It&#39;s who we are as creatures.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Sutton says that the instinct to remove as much friction and internal competition is the right idea, &quot;creating situations where you&#39;re clear who has decision authority is important.&quot; Without that, he says, &quot;you get more politics.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since April, Zappos has moved 10 percent of its employees to the new system. Now that it&#39;s official, Bunch expects that the rest of the company&#39;s employees will transition by the end of 2014. He acknowledges that it could take up to six additional months, though, for people to fully understand its complexity. &quot;T here&#39;s no two ways around it — this is a difficult system to grasp. We&#39;re so ingrained in the traditional work paradigm.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Note: Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post.

He then was flown to the United States for medical treatment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ecuadorian news media reports, first distributed by CNBC, said Bezos had been vacationing on a boat in the Galapagos when his kidney troubles began.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Claudia Testa, the front desk manager at the Royal Palm hotel in Puerto Ayora, a town on Academy Bay, said she had been told that Bezos was taken to a local hospital before being flown out.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos, 49, took over as the owner of The Post in October, officially ending 80 years of local control of the newspaper by the Graham family.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bezos, who founded the online shopping company Amazon.com in 1994 and became a billionaire in the process, paid $250 million to purchase the newspaper and other assets from The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The failure of United Parcel Service and FedEx to deliver packages in time for Christmas exposed the perils of retailers promising to get last-minute gifts to customers. Chains from Kohl&#39;s to Amazon.com to 1-800-Flowers.com offered gift cards and refunds after angry shoppers took to social media to vent. On its Web site, UPS said the volume of last-minute air packages exceeded its capacity to process them. Merchants battling for market share tried to outdo one another with deep discounts and promises that shoppers could order last-minute gifts online. &quot;You had a perfect storm of events from the consumer side, the retailer side and the shipping side,&quot; said Craig Johnson, of Customer Growth Partners. Amazon cited failures in UPS&#39;s transportation network in messages to customers, saying its fulfillment centers processed customers&#39; orders in time for holiday delivery. UPS declined to comment, saying it doesn&#39;t talk about specific customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Detroit</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reached a new settlement in a bid to end interest-rate swap contracts with UBS and Bank of America, cutting the termination amount to about $165 million from $230 million. The agreement still requires bankruptcy court approval.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">American Express has agreed to pay at least $75.7 million to end an investigation into what regulators said was misleading marketing of some discontinued card products. The FDIC said American Express led consumers to believe that an account protection product would work for up to two years when the benefits usually lasted no more than three months, and it didn&#39;t properly explain the enrollment process for a product intended to protect against identity theft.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PNC Financial Services Group agreed to pay $35 million to settle claims that minorities were charged more for home loans than similarly qualified white borrowers. National City Bank, which PNC bought in 2008, violated fair lending laws involving loans made to 76,000 blacks and Hispanics between 2002 and 2008, according to the settlement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Italy&#39;s Parliament passed a new measure on Web advertising, called the &quot;Google tax,&quot; which requires Italian companies to buy Internet ads from locally registered companies, instead of from units based in tax havens such as Ireland, Luxembourg and Bermuda. The bill has stirred controversy, with some lawyers saying it probably violates European Union laws regarding non-discrimination over commercial activity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Target said the Justice Department is investigating the credit and debit card security breach at the retailer.

Peter Malkin and his son Anthony allegedly put their interests ahead of the building&#39;s investors by spurning all-cash offers of as much as $2.3 billion for the building and $1.4 billion for Empire State Building Associates, which held the title and master lease. Instead, the Malkins put the landmark building and 17 other properties into Empire State Realty Trust, whose Oct. 1 IPO valued the property at just $1.89 billion and ESBA at just $1.1 billion, the complaint said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BP&#39;s argument that a multibillion-dollar settlement over the company&#39;s massive 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill shouldn&#39;t compensate businesses if they can&#39;t directly trace their losses to the spill was rejected by a federal judge.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Southwest Airlines, which last hired flight attendants from outside the company in 2011, received applications at a rate of 80 a minute for two hours and five minutes, amassing 10,000 resumes for 750 openings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Delta Air Lines said it will honor tickets sold at incorrect prices on its Web site and through other booking channels after customers snapped up bargains like a round trip to Hawaii for $6.90. The wrong prices were available for a two-hour period. Customers swapped stories of the low fares, such as round-trip flights across the country for $50, on Twitter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barclays Capital was fined almost $4 million by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for &quot;systemic failures&quot; in records retention.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The American Bankers Association said it will mount a legal challenge to the &quot;Volcker rule&quot; unless U.S. banking regulators soften a provision that restricts bank ownership of certain investments. At issue is a provision of the rule that prohibits banks from owning more than 3 percent of any individual hedge fund or private-equity fund and bars banks from investing more than 3 percent of their total equity capital in private funds.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">McDonald&#39;s shut down a Web site intended to provide employees with work and life guidance after it generated negative publicity. The McResource program was criticized for offering sample budgets for employees that were based on holding two jobs and included no costs for heating, as well as suggestions on what to tip a personal fitness trainer or au pair. The Web site, which was run by an outside company, also reportedly discouraged workers from eating fast food as part of its tips for healthy living.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fidelity National Financial&#39;s $2.9 billion acquisition of Lender Processing Services was approved by the Federal Trade Commission after it ordered the companies to sell some assets. Lender Processing Services is a technology company that services the mortgage and real estate industries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jos. A. Bank rejected a takeover offer from competitor Men&#39;s Wearhouse, saying the $1.54 billion bid is too low. Men&#39;s Wearhouse said it will &quot;carefully consider all of our options to make this combination a reality.&quot; That may include launching a proxy battle. In September, a few months after Men&#39;s Wearhouse ousted its founder and chairman, George Zimmer, Jos. A. Bank offered to buy its larger rival for $2.3 billionaire. Men&#39;s Wearhouse rejected that offer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The U.S. economy has grown faster than expected in recent months, and energized American shoppers are the reason why. In September, October and November, consumer spending increased faster than it has in any three-month period since the Great Recession ended. That surge comes with an all-too-familiar side note: in order to spend more, Americans are saving less.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">About 1.3 million long-term unemployed workers were set to lose their federal jobless benefits when the program expired Saturday. The extended benefits, staunchly opposed by Republicans, were left out of the bipartisan federal budget agreement reached this month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The average 30-year fixed-rate loan increased to 4.48 percent from 4.47 percent last week. The average on the 15-year fixed loan rose to 3.52 percent from 3.51 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">New-home sales in November hit the highest level since 2008 with an annualized rate of 464,000.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">President Obama signed into law a bipartisan budget deal softening the blow from scheduled spending cuts and a military bill cracking down on sexual assault. The two bills, passed by Congress with broad bipartisan support, constituted a modest step away from gridlock, and both parties cautiously hoped that spirit of cooperation might linger after New Year&#39;s Day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Federal Reserve Board of Governors unveiled a proposal that would limit the scope of its authority to bail out a large financial company on the brink of collapse through its emergency-lending programs. The Fed&#39;s proposal would implement a key provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that sought to prevent big bailouts after the Fed extended more than $1 trillion in emergency credit in the financial crisis.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Starting on Jan. 1, the monthly amount that commuters can set aside before taxes to spend on mass transit is set to drop from $245 to $130, which for some heavy users could equal nearly $1,000 in higher costs next year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20131229recap1229</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020131229e9ct00059</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 2 end/Image_014.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark64">National-Economy</a><a name="bookmark65">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, UPS offer refunds for Christmas delivery problems; A day after UPS and FedEx were hit by delivery problems that delayed Christmas presents for some, Amazon said it would refund customers.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Amrita Jayakumar 605 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">27 December 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon.com and United Parcel Service said Thursday that they would offer refunds to customers who did not receive their Christmas orders on time, after a larger-than-expected surge in last-minute online shopping caught the shipping giant off guard.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Customers who failed to get their deliveries by Christmas Day will get $20 gift cards and refunds on shipping charges, Amazon said. UPS also offered refunds on shipping costs. FedEx did not promise refunds but said it would work with people affected.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A combination of bad weather, shoppers waiting until the last minute and the overwhelming surge in online buying resulted in some packages not getting under the Christmas tree in time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The wave of shipments was so large that a UPS spokeswoman said &quot;the volume of air packages in our system exceeded the capacity in our network.&quot; Customers who ordered shipments via air or internationally are entitled to refunds, spokeswoman Natalie Black said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wal-Mart and Kohl&#39;s, which also have large online operations and reportedly experienced delays, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Online sales were a bright spot in otherwise gloomy forecasts for the holiday shopping season, according to analysts. The National Retail Federation, a trade group, predicted a 15 percent increase from last year. Holiday sales were expected to rise by only 4 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The last-minute surge that clogged UPS systems may mean that online sales exceeded even optimistic forecasts. Final numbers for the holiday shopping season will be out next month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The short holiday season may also have played a part in the delivery crunch. There were six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year than last year. More than 30 million Americans did not start shopping until after Dec. 9, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation. Nearly half of those surveyed said they planned to shop online. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, about 60 million Americans went to the Web for goods, according to the retail group.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kent Hertzog, 34, said he bought his family gifts last week on Amazon.com, expecting them to arrive in time for Christmas. He&#39;s still waiting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hertzog, who lives in Reading, Pa., said he tracked his shipment on the UPS Web site, which showed that the items were delivered at 5 p.m. Wednesday. But he hasn&#39;t received them yet. His neighbors were also expecting packages, he said, but their delivery date was pushed back to Thursday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The experience has been frustrating, Hertzog said. He couldn&#39;t give his mother her Christmas gift.&quot;It didn&#39;t ruin the day, but now that [Christmas] is over, you still paid for items that are missing,&quot; Hertzog said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">UPS, which had expected to ship more than 132 million packages last week, said that holiday demand was higher than forecast. On its Web site Thursday, the company said it was still &quot;making every effort to get packages to their destination as quickly as possible.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In an e-mailed statement,FedEx said it did not experience any &quot;major service disruptions.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Neither UPS nor FedEx specified how many packages were delayed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon said its systems worked fine. &quot;Amazon fulfillment centers processed and tendered customer orders to delivery carriers on time for holiday delivery.

The word &quot;drone&quot; became so common that manufacturers, unhappy with the term&#39;s close linkage to targeted strikes in faraway regions, began waging a quiet campaign of their own to stop people from saying it out loud. Yes, it&#39;s a silly kind of public relations battle. But the industry has a point: This was the year that we became aware of drones as more than killing machines. We started to understand how they might reshape commerce and transportation and even ethics. Below, six moments in 2013 that pushed drones into the public spotlight.</p><ol id="l2"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s get this one out of the way first. The online retailer unveiled its plans to start shipping five-pound packages by delivery drone sometime in the next five years. To its CEO (and Washington Post top dog) Jeff Bezos, it&#39;s a sensible step in Amazon&#39;s quest to meet our need for instant gratification. To the rest of us, it sounded like an idea out of science fiction. Deliveries in 30 minutes or less? Crazy! But Bezos has been known to make wild investments before.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Washington began grappling with drone regulation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Part of the reason why Amazon had to shoot its promotional video abroad was because U.S. regulations don&#39;t permit the use of drones for commercial purposes in national airspace. Other countries are considered far ahead of us on that count, and some fear the United States could get left behind as the world dumps $89 billion into aerial drones over the next decade. To catch up, the Federal Aviation Administration came out with a hugely anticipated roadmap in November for safely integrating drones into the civilian airspace. By next summer, the FAA is expected to grant wider permissions to owners of small drones (at or under 55 pounds), with larger commercial drones following in the year(s) after.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">The FAA named several key sites for drone testing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This technically hasn&#39;t happened yet. But sometime within the next week the FAA is set to announce a series of six test ranges across the country that will be used to study how drones will affect our safety and privacy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Twenty-four states ranging from New York to Nevada have applied for the honor. It&#39;s a major part of the aforementioned plan to draft new drone regulations. An FAA spokesperson tells me that despite the rapid approach of 2014, the agency is still on track to make a final decision by year&#39;s end.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Obama vowed to review his policy on drone strikes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The president&#39;s controversial use of drones to perform targeted killings drew widespread criticism, particularly in the wake of the 2011 killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born terrorist suspect. In May, Obama gave a speech at the National Defense University in which he admitted that the CIA&#39;s drone program, while legal, may not always be &quot;wise or moral in every instance.&quot; A Gallup poll two months before showed that the public was deeply divided over the issue, with just 41 percent saying drones should be used against U.S. citizens suspected of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">terrorism-related activity abroad. In theory, the White House is shifting responsibility for drone strikes to the military — a move aimed at increasing transparency and accountability. But as the New York Times notes, the transfer has been slow.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">We learned about a secret program to test drones at Area 51.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaking of the CIA, a set of documents dropped this year granting us unprecedented insight into the agency&#39;s early research on drones during the Vietnam War. As the country kept losing U-2 spy planes, officials started a couple of projects that were ultimately abandoned, but not before producing working prototypes that were flown at Area 51. One design was even fashioned into a kind of missile after the researchers determined that it was too noisy to use for reconnaissance.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">A Colorado town proposed open season on drones.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Deer Trail, Colo., has about 600 residents — and they&#39;re not friendly at all to unmanned vehicles. A town vote scheduled for this month would have made it legal to hunt drones, with licenses and everything. The idea&#39;s proponents argue that it simply gives them a way to defend against aerial trespassing. But the proposal also contains bounties for salvaged hardware: Up to $100 for every government-owned drone. Unfortunately, the referendum itself has been postponed and likely won&#39;t be held until next year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020131226e9cq003jt</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 2 end/Image_016.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark68">ezra-klein</a><a name="bookmark69">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Eight ways robots stole our jobs in 2013</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Lydia DePillis 872 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24 December 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If we talked about nothing else in 2013 -- and, all right, 2012, too -- we talked about the question of whether technology is going to take all our jobs. This latest surge of the age-old debate seems to have abated, for now, with the anti-robot contingent in America somewhat mollified by the promise that additional automation may be the one advance that allows for manufacturing jobs to return from overseas and relieves humans of the most dangerous and unpleasant tasks. Theoretically, the robotic gospel goes, that talent is then freed up for more fulfilling and productive work. (Hint: The more &quot;creative&quot; and &quot;social&quot; you are, the more likely you are to survive.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Either way, it&#39;s worth looking at the different ways automation began rendering new classes of jobs obsolete this year.</p><ol id="l3"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">The people who mail stuff</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Back in 2012, Amazon acquired Kiva Systems, a maker of robots that can be programmed to pick up online orders in a warehouse and shuttle them to their departure points. The company now has 1,382 of the machines in three fulfillment centers, which means it eventually may not even have to hire the tens of thousands of temp workers it brings on for the busy holiday season. And if you had any doubts that Amazon could eventually do the same with flying drones, well, let this be a lesson. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">The people who reheat pre-cooked food</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The nationwide fast-food strikes brought dire warnings from restaurant industry-backed researchers that if line cooks cost too much, they could easily be replaced by robots. That hasn&#39;t quite happened yet, but at least one company is working diligently to make it possible. It&#39;s reasonable to believe that McDonalds -- which is already replacing cashiers with touch screens in Europe -- would jump at the chance.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">The people who sell clothes</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">E-commerce has been steadily eating away at brick-and-mortar stores for years now, but what&#39;s been cropping up more recently is a breed of business that sees taking retail out of the picture as a point of pride. American Giant, for example: The purveyor of basic, high-quality clothing makes its stuff just outside San Francisco, which it can do affordably because it sells to in-the-know urban sophisticates purely online, skipping the American Apparel-style marketing blitz altogether. That may mean you can get a high-quality, U.S.-made hoodie for a competitive price. It also means that the people who might otherwise have sold it to you don&#39;t have jobs.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">The people who stock shelves and return shopping carts</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not all labor-saving innovations are high-tech. The discount supermarket Aldi -- which is owned by the same corporate parent as the more bourgeois Trader Joe&#39;s -- keeps payroll down by requiring a 25-cent deposit for shopping carts so employees don&#39;t have to return them, and stocking shelves with boxes full of goods rather than placing the individual items in neat rows. Again, great for shoppers on a budget -- at the cost of employment.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">People who drive trucks</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Autonomous vehicle technology is accelerating, and for now, is focused on passenger vehicles. But the real labor shortage is in long-haul trucking, and as my colleague Brian Fung pointed out, that&#39;s a job that might be more safely filled by a remotely-controlled robot that never gets tired or lost. Which just means that the 5.7 million people who do the job now will have to find a new way to make a living.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">People who operate farm equipment</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The history of agriculture has been one long tale of automation, to the point where almost nobody works on farms in America anymore. The exception was supposed to be people who operated the machines that replaced people who tilled the soil and harvested the crops by hand. But even they&#39;re not safe anymore, with the advent of tractors that can be piloted around the fields by computer or even programmed with the right coordinates and set loose, like a gigantic dirt-treading Roomba.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">The people who make iProducts</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After years of close scrutiny for the working conditions in its factories, Foxconn -- which makes most of Apple&#39;s computers, phones, and tablets -- decided to swap people out for machines as much as possible. The process hasn&#39;t been as quick or as easy as anticipated, but with wages rising in China, Foxconn has little choice but to keep cranking out the one-million-strong army of &quot;Foxbots&quot; it promised back in 2010.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">The people who do low-level lab work</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In North Carolina&#39;s Research Triangle Park, a company called LabCorp is hard at work developing machines to sort and split blood samples, which is just one of hundreds of thousands of menial laboratory jobs that pay decent money but could more efficiently be done by robots.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We may be able to add bartenders next year, but at this point, it still seems that man has an advantage over machines in making a decent Manhattan.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document WPCOM00020131223e9cn00338</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark70">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark71">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Ford pilots software to navigate factories Amazon brings Web services to China</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">239 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23 December 2013 The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL A12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

In 2011, a South American court found the company liable for three decades of soil and water pollution near oil wells that ruined the health and livelihoods of Amazon rain-forest dwellers. Since then, Ecuadoran farmers and fishermen have tried to collect $19 billion in environmental damages from San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron, the world&#39;s third-largest oil company. The award was reduced to $9.5 billion from $19 billion Nov. 12 by the National Court of Justice, Ecuador&#39;s highest tribunal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;After all these years, the Ecuadoran plaintiffs deserve to have recognition and enforcement of the Ecuadoran judgment heard on the merits in an appropriate jurisdiction.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just when it seemed like Amazon&#39;s concept for a drone-powered fleet of quadricopters for Amazon Prime Air was going to be the most outlandish idea of the year from the tech sector, along comes the news that Google just acquired Boston Dynamics, the company best known for creating DARPA Atlas robots and &quot;creepy galloping robots&quot; like the BigDog and the Wild Cat. What the heck is going on here?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It would be easy to think that this move was just another bit of Silicon Valley-style one-upmanship, this time between Google CEO Larry Page and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. By acquiring a robotic animals company with just days to go before the world settles in for the winter holidays, Google gets the final say for the year and cements its reputation as being one of the most innovative companies in the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Except that robotics appears to be a very serious initiative at Google rather than something announced after repeated viewings of the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; drones segment with Jeff Bezos. Boston Dynamics is the eighth robotics company acquired by Google this year, with other companies acquired involved in similar activities including robots capable of loading and unloading delivery trucks. One company bought by Google, Bot &amp; Dolly, makes a robotic camera system that was used to film Clooney and Bullock in &quot;Gravity,&quot; Alfonso Cuaron&#39;s remarkable film about outer space.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The head of the new robotics division at Google is Andy Rubin, the same person who spearheaded the development of the Android operating system at Google. Rubin himself has a personal interest in robotics and tweeted out that &quot;the future is looking awesome!&quot; just after Google bought Boston Dynamics. It now appears that Rubin took on robotics as another &quot;moonshot&quot; business for Google, the same way that driverless cars were a &quot;moonshot&quot; business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">So the conventional wisdom that Google&#39;s robots would be factory drone-workers, assembling things such as Android phones and then delivering them door-to-door to customers, doesn&#39;t seem to make sense. You don&#39;t need a WildCat running at 40 mph to do that. That&#39;s like bringing a gun to a knife fight.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So if not for a drones-inspired initiative, what could Google&#39;s robotic menagerie possibly be for?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Remember Google&#39;s mission statement is to &quot;organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful.&quot; So here&#39;s another admittedly outlandish idea. Google is using these robots as literal foot soldiers in the race to organize the world&#39;s information.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These robots, once they&#39;ve been outfitted with cameras, could be sent anywhere in the world as part of a new Google Maps initiative. It would essentially be Google StreetView without the cars. Or, perhaps Google&#39;s driverless cars would drop off the robotic dogs and cats at the edge of a mountain range or arctic glacier and wait for them to come back after trudging around for awhile.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another scenario is that these robotic animals could help to bring Internet access to remote locations. Remember the Google Loon project, which would use helium balloons to bring Internet connectivity to hard-to-reach locales? Well, what about a network of robots connected with WiFi routers that are able to go anywhere, do anything, to bring the wireless Internet to every single corner of the globe?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t make sense that Google would try to do something that doesn&#39;t fit into a longer-term strategy, such as creating some kind of vast cyborg army just for the lulz. Once you hook up Google&#39;s Android army to Ray Kurzweil&#39;s artificial intelligence initiatives at Google, though, watch out. The future appears to be one</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of hyper-intelligent computing machines that are the physical and mental equals of humans, capable of going anywhere on the planet. (Or perhaps into outer space as in the film &quot;Gravity&quot;)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The innovation ball is now back in Amazon&#39;s court. Google has shown us once again that no idea is too big, no idea is too outlandish, if you want to be considered the most innovative company in the world. That&#39;s what the Big Dogs do, they go big or they go home.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020131219e9cj002s3</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark76">Business</a><a name="bookmark77">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services to expand into China; The company signed a memorandum of understanding with the Beijing Municipal Government.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Mohana Ravindranath 261 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">18 December 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BERLIN - Hundreds of Amazon.com workers in Germany went on strike Monday, just as pre-Christmas sales were set to peak, in a dispute over pay and conditions that has raged for months.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Germany is Amazon&#39;s second-biggest market, behind the United States, and sales there grew almost 21 percent in 2012, to $8.7 billion, a third of its overseas total. Amazon took its most daily orders in Germany last Dec. 16, when almost 4 million articles were bought, with shipments peaking Dec. 17.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which employs 9,000 warehouse staff members in Germany plus 14,000 seasonal workers at nine distribution centers, said that 1,115 employees joined the strike at three sites but that there have been no delays to deliveries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Our customers can continue to rely on us for the prompt delivery of their Christmas presents,&quot; a spokeswoman said, adding that Amazon uses its whole European logistics network during the Christmas period to ensure delivery times.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Verdi union said that up to 700 workers joined the strike in Amazon&#39;s logistic center in Bad Hersfeld, plus 500 to 600 in Leipzig. For the first time, the union also called a strike in Graben, where Verdi said 600 workers took part.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The Amazon system is characterized by low wages, permanent performance pressure and short-term contracts,&quot; Verdi board member Stefanie Nutzenberger said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A delegation of German workers was set to rally at Amazon&#39;s headquarters in Seattle along with U.S. unions. In addition, workers in Amazon&#39;s center in the German town of Werne will protest Tuesday, while strikes are expected to continue all week in Leipzig and until Wednesday in Bad Hersfeld.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Amazon must realize it cannot export its anti-union labor model to European shores. We call on the company to come to the table and sign a global agreement that guarantees the rights of workers,&quot; said Philip Jennings of the global trade union UNI.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Verdi organized several short stoppages this year to try to force Amazon to accept collective-bargaining agreements in the mail-order and retail industry as benchmarks for workers&#39; pay at Amazon&#39;s German distribution centers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But Amazon&#39;s German country head Ralf Kleber said the company would not bow to pressure from striking workers and was more worried about bad weather hurting Christmas deliveries, he said in an interview last month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kleber said that Amazon pays warehouse workers well according to the standards of the logistics industry, starting at $13.11 an hour, and does not think the more generous terms of the mail-order and retail sector are justified.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon recently announced that it would build three new logistics centers in Poland and two in the Czech Republic, prompting speculation that it could seek to shift work across the border from strike-hit centers in Germany.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Kleber said Amazon expected to keep expanding in Germany, including eventually delivering fresh groceries, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bookstores are terminally ill. Borders? Dead. Barnes &amp; Noble? Life support. Amazon is king. E-books are the present and the future. Have tablet, will read.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But in downtown Frederick, Md., Marlene and Tom England are defying the future: They recently opened the Curious Iguana bookstore. It carries books printed on paper. Nonfiction. Poetry. Short stories. That seems insane, right? Some people strolling by certainly think so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;ve heard them say: &#39;A bookstore? Who would open up a bookstore these days?&#39; &quot; Marlene said. &quot;I mean really, the door is open. I can heeaaaaaaaar you.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Marlene has not ventured outside to offer the doomsayers a retort, but if she did, it would be this: Independent bookstores are not dead. In fact, in some of the country&#39;s most urbane and educated communities, they are making a comeback.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In an e-tailing world, their resurgence is driven by e-book growth that has leveled off, dyed-in-the-wool print lovers who won&#39;t (or can&#39;t) abandon page flipping, a new category of hybrid reader (the latest mystery, digital; the latest John Irving, print) and savvy retailers such as the Englands, positioning their stores squarely in the buy-local movement and as a respite from screens.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The American Booksellers Association, which represents independent bookstores, says its membership — it hit a low of 1,600 in 2008 — has grown 6.4 percent in 2013, to 2,022. Sales were up 8 percent in 2012, and those gains have held this year. In the District, sales at Politics and Prose, where President Obama and his daughters went Christmas shopping last month, have grown each of the past few years. Its owners pondered an additional outlet in Georgetown, but the original idea for a location fell through.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nationally, while there are still indie bookstores shutting their doors, unable to hold on against the tough head winds, there are more stores opening than closing. Word, the popular Brooklyn indie, just opened a new branch at an old Burger King in Jersey City. Bookbug, in Kalamazoo, Mich., has doubled its size. Novelist Ann Patchett opened a store in Nashville. There are new openings in St. Louis, in Durham, N.C., and beyond.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We just never bought into the sky-is-falling mentality,&quot; Marlene England said. &quot;You see the headlines, but you have to dig deep to see what&#39;s really happening.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The indie resurgence became publishing&#39;s central narrative this year. Publishers Weekly, the industry&#39;s trade bible, last month named Oren Teicher, chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, and his group&#39;s board as its person of the year, an honor previously given to &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey &quot; author E.L. James and Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, the owner of The Washington Post and a villain to indie booksellers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We are a lot like Mark Twain: The rumors of our death are a little bit exaggerated,&quot; Teicher said. &quot;We have been counted out for a very long time.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Twenty-five years ago, independents were supposed to vanish when Waldenbooks showed up in malls. They were supposed to vanish when Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble came along with endless selection and comfy chairs. They were supposed to vanish when Costco started selling the latest Doris Kearns Goodwin . They were</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">supposed to vanish when Amazon perfected low prices and fast shipments — not just for books but even for rowboats, meaning nobody would ever have to leave the house again to shop.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I think what we&#39;re seeing is that the inevitable death of any kind of physical retailing was a gross exaggeration,&quot; said Laura J. Miller, a Brandeis sociology professor and author of &quot;Reluctant Capitalists: Bookselling and the Culture of Consumption .&quot; &quot;There are a lot of reasons people like going to bricks-and-mortar stores, especially to bookstores that are offering something more than just a convenient shopping experience.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Englands&#39; objective when they opened the Curious Iguana was to offer something more. They are experienced in the art of throwback retailing. They own Dancing Bear Toys and Gifts, a popular downtown Frederick toy store specializing in toys without batteries. Even in the face of Xboxes, flying toys and children snatching their parents&#39; iPhones to play games, the Dancing Bear&#39;s sales have increased every year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We think there&#39;s a desire by many to go back to a very simple time,&quot; Tom England said. &quot;Kids are starting to play Risk again. People want to touch things. They want to be a little low-tech.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Englands were pondering opening another toy store in a different downtown, but they love Frederick and realized something special was happening there — a rebirth fueled by upscale food, high-end antiques and cute cafes. Their toy store&#39;s book section was booming, so they thought of opening a kids bookstore.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But people around town pushed them to open a bookstore for general interest. They visited Politics and Prose one morning. It was packed. They saw statistics showing that indie stores&#39; sales were growing again. And so they took a huge gamble: They moved their toy store off the main street and around the corner, putting the Curious Iguana in its spot.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The walls are a warm purple. Edison lights hang from the ceiling. The hardwood floor creaks. And they gave the store a larger mission, too — sharing a portion of the proceeds with international nonprofit organizations. Sales, the Englands say, are higher than they expected. One recent Saturday afternoon the store was packed with about two dozen customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We need intimate, small places like this that care about the books they pick,&quot; said Lisa Solomon, a Frederick resident holding several children&#39;s books. &quot;This isn&#39;t just a bookstore. It&#39;s more than that.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ryan Young, 38, dropped $130 on cookbooks, kids titles and some other hardcovers. She said something that many book buyers would be afraid to utter in an indie store: &quot;I&#39;m an Amazon Prime member.&quot; She also admitted to owning and enjoying a Kindle. Lightning did not strike her. That&#39;s because she also said this: &quot;Having a book in my hands — nothing stacks up to that.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Young is an emerging positive for indie bookstores: a hybrid reader. About 64 percent of U.S. book buyers prefer reading in both print and digital, according to the Codex Group, which regularly surveys readers. Young reads series mysteries on her Kindle, but literary titles come home in print. Industry statistics show that e-book sales are largely tilted toward genre reading, a trend playing out in Young&#39;s life.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;There has to be a value in both,&quot; she said. &quot;There are books on my bookshelves that are like my friends. You can go back to them over and over again.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Marlene England is not offended about the Amazon.com remark. &quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be an either-or,&quot; she said. &quot;You don&#39;t have to feel guilty for buying e-books. We all do it — for convenience, for travel, whatever.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">E-books, however, have not come to overwhelm bookselling as many experts predicted five years ago. Statistics from earlier this year showed that e-book sales were up 5 percent in the first quarter, compared with 28 percent in 2012 and 159 percent in 2011.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The growth curve really has flattened, so that&#39;s good for us,&quot; said Bradley Graham, a former Washington Post reporter who owns Politics and Prose with his wife, Lissa Muscatine.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But many independent bookstore owners, including Graham, concede that e-books are a big part of the industry&#39;s future, so they are embracing the technology. In partnership with Kobo, an Amazon competitor, Politics and Prose and other independent bookstores are selling the company&#39;s e-readers and e-books in exchange for a small cut of sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Graham says the partnership hasn&#39;t yielded meaningful revenue. More promising, he said, are the store&#39;s other ancillary offerings — daily author readings, dozens of paid classes, and book-oriented trips. The store recently added beer and wine sales for in-store events.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, publishing experts say that independents might be fighting for their lives again five or 10 years down the road. College students today — the book buyers of tomorrow — are finding a heavy emphasis on digital textbooks in the classroom, and there is a risk they won&#39;t ever become hybrid book buyers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Also, Amazon shows no sign of giving indies any relief on what store owners consider predatory pricing, especially on key titles they need to push. Donna Tartt&#39;s new novel, &quot;The Goldfinch ,&quot; is selling for $30 at Curious Iguana.

Bezos revealed to CBS&#39;s Charlie Rose that Amazon.com was planning for a fleet of whirring octocopters to deliver everyone&#39;s next iPhone case, the video that went along with it showed a prototype drone rising lazily off the ground and floating across green, open fields to reach its destination. It could&#39;ve been anywhere — sunny California, maybe, or somewhere near Seattle. But it was actually neither of those places. Turns out it wasn&#39;t even in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Spokespeople for Amazon and the Federal Aviation Administration have confirmed that the company chose an international location for its concept video after FAA restrictions prevented them from shooting here. Exactly which lucky country got a cameo is still a mystery; neither official would talk specifics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drone policy watchers say Canada would have been an attractive option — it&#39;s not far from Amazon&#39;s home base, Seattle, and the rules governing unmanned aircraft are a little more relaxed there.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I can also imagine maybe a small eastern European country being a good candidate,&quot; says Timothy Reuter, who heads the DC Area Drone User Group.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fact that Amazon had to leave the country to make the video underscores how slowly U.S. officials have embraced the policy challenge. It also offers a concrete example of what the country stands to lose, as the market for civil drone use picks up globally. They&#39;ve been criticized before for lagging on their new set of drone guidelines; it won&#39;t be until 2015 that the FAA finally integrates small drones into the national airspace, with full-on commercial drones getting addressed sometime later, according to a governmental plan released last month. The current regime makes exceptions for hobbyists and those who receive a special certificate from the FAA.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sometime before the end of the month, the agency is expected to announce a number of test sites it&#39;ll use to assess the impact of unmanned vehicles on safety and security.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon.com&#39;s Prime Air service promises to get goodies to your door in less than 30 minutes. But what puts the company in a position to make that offer is a responsive supply chain. Already, under its two-day shipping policy, Amazon has to make sure each of its warehouses has enough of the items everyone wants, or else a sufficiently robust backhaul option that can fulfill requests on short notice.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Either way, Amazon is hugely dependent on air cargo. And it&#39;s the part of the supply chain that customers don&#39;t interact with that stands to be affected most by drone technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FedEx chief executive Fred Smith has been discussing the use of unmanned aircraft in backhaul shipping for some time. Rather than the flying cigars of today, though, Smith thinks future cargo planes will favor a &quot;blended wing&quot; design that looks like a cross between a traditional airliner and a stealth bomber.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unlike the fragile-looking copter drones that are currently available to hobbyists (and that Amazon sees as the key to Prime Air), unmanned blended wings are the object of intense research by massive aerospace companies with real money to spend. Boeing&#39;s X-48C is a blended-wing unmanned aircraft that concluded an eight-month flight-test program with NASA earlier this year. That&#39;s being followed by research into a larger version of the X-48 that&#39;s capable of transonic speeds.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Planes like these would have much more room for goods than current aircraft, making air freight more economical. Even today&#39;s jetliners mostly run themselves, with human pilots stepping in only to perform takeoff and landing. A shift to unmanned aircraft would still require pilots in the short term to fly planes remotely; but in the long run, this technology could become a way for FedEx to eliminate many of its pilots.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asked about the potential for a fully autonomous fleet, a FedEx spokesperson said the company &quot;support[s] our pilots completely.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, UPS is reportedly weighing a service to compete with Prime Air. A company spokesperson, however, wouldn&#39;t discuss its backhaul operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re always looking for the best technology,&quot; said UPS&#39; Kara Ross.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The secrecy is hardly a surprise. Cargo companies are waiting for the Federal Aviation Administration to finish drafting a set of guidelines for integrating commercial drones into the nation&#39;s airspace, a process that isn&#39;t expected to wrap for several years. But that isn&#39;t keeping companies from making as many preparations as they can.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon.com chief executive and founder Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While obviously there are a lot of technological, legal and regulatory hurdles to overcome before we ever see a fleet of Amazon Prime Air octocopters taking off from distribution centers across America and making</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">door-to-door deliveries, the momentum behind the commercial drone revolution continues to build. There are now over 25,000 DIY drone enthusiasts in America, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) prototypes already exist for a number of commercial applications. By some estimates, commercial drones could boost the U.S. economy by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$13.6 billion and create 70,000 new jobs within just a few years. Once the FAA finally rules on potential applications for commercial drones (expected in late 2015), it will be time for the training wheels to come off the domestic drone bandwagon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As wacky and futuristic as Amazon&#39;s vision for Prime Air may sound, it&#39;s actually an idea that dates back to at least 2009. FedEx, for example, has even tentatively explored plans for a giant fleet of commercial unmanned drones to deliver packages. That&#39;s right -- the entire FedEx fleet would be comprised of robotic drones. These unmanned delivery vehicles would be more along the lines of massive 777 cargo freighter drones than Amazon octocopters, but you get the idea: the logistics business is looking for a faster, cheaper delivery model and drones are going to be involved somehow. There&#39;s even been talk of drone fleets flying in bird-like formations over cities and then disassembling as they go about their final delivery routes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In order to think about drones the way Jeff Bezos thinks about drones, just imagine any delivery service being reinvented as a drone delivery service, where robots replace humans. In densely populated urban areas, takeout orders are one example of how consumer drones could revolutionize different business models. In early 2012, for example, there was much speculation about &quot;TacoCopters&quot; eventually being able to deliver tacos to young tech workers in the San Francisco Bay Area using a fleet of quadricopters. But think about it -- any urban area full of bike messengers and pizza delivery guys could benefit from the 30 minutes or less approach of a Jeff Bezos. At some point, it&#39;s possible to imagine going out to a baseball game or music festival on a warm summer day, pressing a button on your smartphone, and having a drone deliver a nice cold beer to your seat within minutes. In South Africa, for example, they already have beer drones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So what other business models might profit from consumer drones? Imagine personal security drones buzzing around your home, keeping it safe while you&#39;re away on vacation and capable of interacting with police and fire department first-responders. There&#39;s also been talk of how drones could lead to massive new efficiencies in the agricultural sector by giving farmers and ranchers the ability to monitor vast areas. Oil and gas exploration teams could deploy drones to survey remote areas. Real estate agents could use them to create videos of new properties on the market. And, of course, Hollywood film directors could create new types of action shots using drones capable of recording video from unique angles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And you wouldn&#39;t even have to be a Hollywood director to take advantage of this last capability. What if, for example, you were to combine the GoPro video revolution (recently featured by Anderson Cooper on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in November) with the technological capabilities of a drone, such that you had a personal GoPro video drone following you around and doing your bidding when it wasn&#39;t otherwise filming your every move? That might sound insane, but that&#39;s the vision from former Wired editor Chris Anderson, who recently landed $30 million in VC financing for his drones company, 3D Robotics, and has been at the forefront of advancing something he&#39;s calling an &quot;autonomous personal robot.&quot; As Anderson recently outlined in a cover story for Wired , the &quot;autonomous personal robot&quot; is essentially a &quot;pet bird&quot; that follows you around wherever you are.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And that&#39;s not all. Commercial drone technology is an exponential technology, meaning that we&#39;ll continue to see massive improvements in what they&#39;re capable of. They&#39;ll shrink in size and become more powerful with every passing year. Once the FAA rules on commercial drones in 2015, we&#39;ll likely see an explosion of commercial</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">drone concepts, as those 25,000 DIY drone hobbyists in America are able to unlock their innovation in pursuit of new business ideas. Drones will no longer be an underground hobbyist activity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the end, that might just be the future that Jeff Bezos envisions -- he may not really plan to fly all those Amazon octocopters, but he&#39;s laying the groundwork for innovation so that Amazon can benefit from all the size and scale advantages once operating a commercial drone fleet becomes economically feasible and legally possible. One thing is certain, though -- Jeff Bezos just raised the bar for what to expect at next year&#39;s TED conference. Flying robot swarms are so 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Related: Rounding up the Amazon drone skepticism</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">And below, our friends at PostTV discussed what we could do with drones: Document WPCOM00020131203e9c30038q</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 2 end/Image_019.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark88">the-switch</a><a name="bookmark89">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon drones are a fun gimmick, but ground vehicles are the future of retail</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Timothy B.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Internet is currently obsessed with Amazon&#39;s plan to deliver packages via unmanned &quot;octocopters.&quot; Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos believes the technology may be ready within five years, and that they could enable packages to be delivered in as little as 30 minutes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aerial drone technology could revolutionize the retail business, threatening not only other online retailers but some brick-and-mortar ones as well. But flying robots probably won&#39;t be the only automated delivery technology entering the market in the coming decade. They&#39;ll have to compete against self-driving vehicles that drive around on the ground. And ground-based delivery robots may be the winners in the long run.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The ones on the ground should be the long-term winner because they&#39;re going to be more efficient,&quot; says Brad Templeton, chair of networks and computing at Singularity University who has been writing about the potential of self-driving vehicles, including delivery robots, for more than five years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And surprisingly, Templeton argues, ground-based delivery robots will be &quot;able to go to more places.&quot; Templeton argues that if you look at satellite pictures, &quot;you&#39;ll find that even as a human being, you&#39;re not sure how to land on peoples&#39; yards.&quot; Obstructions like trees, power lines, tall buildings, and the like can make it tricky to land in some parts of town. High winds or other adverse weather conditions can make drone deliveries even more challenging.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The problem of piloting a self-driving vehicle is comparative simple. And once ground-based vehicles don&#39;t need human drivers, they can be made extremely small, simple, and cheap. Templeton envisions &quot;robots the size of a dog&quot; driving around urban streets at modest speeds. The small size, low speed, and lack of human passengers means that safety wouldn&#39;t be a big issue. That might allow the technology to be introduced earlier than full-scale self-driving cars.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Flying and driving robots have different strengths and weaknesses. Bezos says you won&#39;t be able to have table saws or kayaks delivered by Amazon&#39;s drones. But these items could easily be delivered by a self-driving ground vehicle. On the other hand, a ground-based vehicle is never going to get to its destination quite as quickly as a flying one can. So if consumers want their products in a hurry, Amazon Prime Air may be the best option. The Amazon.com of the future might offer customers a choice between getting 60-minute ground delivery for free or 20-minute air delivery for an extra fee.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One challenge for both delivery types is what to do with the packages upon arrival. Here, Templeton argues that the flying machines might have an advantage: they can drop packages in peoples&#39; back yards, where they&#39;re less likely to be stolen. They could drop them on the roofs of apartment buildings, which would only be accessible to building residents. Ground vehicles, on the other hand, might be given a code to open customers&#39; garage doors, though that could raise security issues of its own.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But in the long run, Templeton predicts, this problem will go away entirely as delivery companies increasingly deliver packages directly into the hands of recipients. With delivery times measured in minutes rather than days, vehicles could go directly to the customer&#39;s physical location. That might mean delivering packages to users while they&#39;re at home. It could also mean using the GPS on the customer&#39;s phone to visit the customer wherever he happens to be when a package is ordered: at work, the dentist&#39;s office, or a child&#39;s school. Drones, Templeton says could &quot;get rid of this idea that we deliver on the delivery company&#39;s schedule and deliver on your schedule instead.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most likely, the future of retail will use a mix of ground- and air-based delivery vehicles. Air-based vehicles make for better television. But the lower cost, higher capacity, and greater reliability of ground-based vehicles means they&#39;re likely to be the workhorse of 21st Century retail.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You may have heard that unmanned drones will eventually be making your Amazon deliveries. The idea seems so crazy, it&#39;s bound to raise a few questions. Is it really possible? What kind of obstacles will Amazon chief executive (and Washington Post owner) Jeffrey Bezos have to overcome? And how will his plan shape the future of drone technology? Answers to these and more are below.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First things first. What does Amazon have in mind?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In as little as five years, Amazon says, it&#39;s going to field a fleet of drones that will deliver anything you order — so long as it&#39;s under five pounds — in minutes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What? That&#39;s crazy. How would that even work?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Conveniently, Amazon has these giant distribution centers scattered around the country. Most of the company&#39;s deliveries start out from these facilities; the drones would simply be cutting out the truck drivers who deliver your packages today.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos has lost it, hasn&#39;t he?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You&#39;d have to be crazy not to think that drone deliveries might play some role in the future of shipping. Amateurs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">— and some companies, too — have already proven very willing to take on the challenge. So it&#39;s only natural that Amazon also sees an opportunity here.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay, maybe he&#39;s not crazy. But what kind of opportunity are we talking about?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Traditional retailers compete on the strength of their products. But Amazon, increasingly, is competing on the basis of time — fulfilling our wishes as close to instantaneously as possible. The drone strategy promises to cut what&#39;s currently a one- or two-day shipping window down to 30 minutes or even less. Drones have an advantage over delivery trucks in that they can use a more direct route, rather than having to follow winding streets. That saves time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What do we know about Amazon&#39;s drones?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos has told us that the drones will be able to carry a five-pound payload for about 10 miles. It&#39;s not completely clear whether Bezos expects the drones to come back to the facility in half an hour or if he&#39;s only counting outbound travel time. But experts estimate that a 15-minute flight out, followed by a 15-minute flight back, would call for average speeds of 40 miles an hour. That&#39;s pretty zippy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Are current drones even capable of all that?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That depends on what drone researchers call SWaP — size, weight and power. This is essentially a physics problem: The larger your payload, the more lift you need. The more lift you need, the larger your battery has to be, which further adds to the weight, which adds to the power requirements, and so on.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After analyzing Amazon&#39;s promotional video, Christopher Vo — a robotics researcher at George Mason University</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">— estimates that Amazon&#39;s &quot;octocopter&quot; drone probably uses a 10,000-mAh, 22-volt lithium ion polymer battery made up of six or 10 cells. These batteries are a lot like the ones that power a laptop, except that their chemistry</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">allows for a much greater energy draw. You can find these easily on hobbyist Web sites. And, in fact, according to Vo, you can actually buy an octocopter resembling the one in Amazon&#39;s video for about $24,000.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What about larger payloads? Five pounds doesn&#39;t sound like much.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s possible, but improbable, at least for now. Some private drones can carry more than a dozen pounds of weight. But in the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview Sunday, Bezos acknowledged that &quot;we&#39;re not going to deliver kayaks or table saws that way.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Where we might actually see faster progress is in the way that companies ship things internally. Big 747s and other cargo planes can already fly on autopilot, for the most part. From there, it&#39;s not too far of a leap to convert them into fully autonomous aircraft.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos predicts the Amazon drones will take off in about five years. How realistic is that?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s optimistic but not unrealistic. A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration says that while current rules prohibit Amazon from rolling this out today, a three- to five-year target &quot;kind of lines up&quot; with an FAA process to relax those regulations. Last month, the agency released a roadmap charting out how those regulations will be rewritten. By next August, the FAA expects to have rules ready for consumer drones, followed by guidelines for commercial drones a few years later.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here&#39;s something else to think about: The United States may not actually be the best place to test this program out. Given how long it&#39;s taken for the FAA to loosen its policies on commercial drones, we might see Amazon turn to other countries first. Timothy Reuter, who heads a D.C.-based drone hobbyists&#39; group, says Canada might be an attractive choice. &quot;It&#39;s not so far away, but they&#39;re much more permissive,&quot; says Reuter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Are these drones going to crash into my dogs and kids?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The risk will probably be pretty low, at least at the outset. But that&#39;s only because the drones will likely be controlled by humans.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What you&#39;re really asking about are fully autonomous drones. The big obstacle is, well, detecting obstacles. Human pilots instinctively know to avoid trees and buildings. Drones don&#39;t. For that, they need something called sense-and-avoid technology — which is pretty good at the moment, but not great enough that we can trust an entire machine to fly itself exclusively. Until then, Amazon will probably hire drone pilots to fly each individual drone. Then it might graduate to a system where one overseer is monitoring a handful of machines at once from a control center.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another way to solve the sense-and-avoid problem, says Vo, is to reduce the number of variables that the drone will have to contend with near the ground. You could do this by building some kind of helipad on people&#39;s rooftops so that the drone never has to interact with your doorstep. Maybe this will even become standard across most new homes so that other companies — FedEx, UPS, etc. — could take advantage of it, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">So, you&#39;re saying these things will be equipped with cameras? Yep. And that raises a whole range of privacy issues, says Reuter.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;From the video [Amazon] shot, they only showed this thing flying over wide open fields, not anyone&#39;s head,&quot; says Reuter. &quot;Obviously, the safety risk there was very low. The reality is, they&#39;ll be flying over many inhabited areas if this is going to be meaningful. Where this is going to make a lot of sense is in dense urban areas. But that&#39;s the hardest nut to crack from a safety and privacy perspective.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(The drones will also presumably need to operate in inclement weather, not only in the clear, sunny skies shown in the corporate video.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sounds creepy. I don&#39;t want to be watched by an Amazon drone. Wait here -- I&#39;m getting my shotgun.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whoa, okay. That actually points to something else Amazon will have to think about — how to protect its unmanned vehicles. You&#39;re not the only person who&#39;s thought about shooting these things down; residents of one Colorado town have even considered giving out actual hunting permits for unmanned vehicles. There are all sorts of other ways you could tamper with airborne delivery devices. For years, the FAA has been battling troublemakers who shine lasers into the eyes of human pilots while they&#39;re at the controls. What if somebody tried to blind an Amazon drone?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then there&#39;s the question of how to secure the data link between Amazon&#39;s drones and the ground control station that monitors them. You don&#39;t want your delivery to get hacked and stolen, or worse — turned into a flying weapon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Currently most of the [ground control system] feeds in the consumer space are unencrypted,&quot; says George Mason&#39;s Vo. &quot;But even if they are encrypted, you can still deny service by radio jamming and other kinds of activities like that.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hang on. Didn&#39;t Amazon just announce a deal with the U.S. Postal Service? Won&#39;t these drones supersede them?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s a possibility. But remember, this future is still years away. Amazon&#39;s experiment with drone technology suggests it may be looking at drones as simply one part of a broader delivery system that integrates multiple technologies. There are other emerging new technologies, such as 3D printing and self-driving cars, that might help Amazon tighten up any lags in its supply chain and get items to consumers more quickly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document WPCOM00020131202e9c200566</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark92">the-switch</a><a name="bookmark93">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s drones are &#39;all fun and games until little Sally loses a finger&#39; ; Experts are skeptical that the FAA will buy Amazon&#39;s autonomous drones.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Andrea Peterson 652 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3 December 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos showed CBS&#39;s Charlie Rose a prototype drone, termed an &quot;octocopter,&quot; designed for picking up packages at Amazon fulfillment centers and dropping them off at customer residences. That&#39;s a cool concept. But like the various beer and burrito delivering drones of the past, some experts say it&#39;s nothing more than a gimmick at this point due to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) process for approving civilian drones in the national airspace.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Matt Waite, a professor at the University of Nebraska and founder of their Drone Journalism Lab, is skeptical of Bezos&#39;s plan, saying he &quot;does not really comprehend what the FAA says they might allow in 2015, and it also really underestimates how slow the FAA has been going with this.&quot; Waite has had his own run-ins with the FAA, who essentially shut down the Drone Journalism Lab&#39;s ability to fly outdoors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What the FAA has said is that in 2014 they are going to put out a notice of proposed rule-making; the intent behind that is to establish rules for small unmanned aerial systems.&quot; That means drones up to 55 pounds, Waite said. &quot;The rules will definitely cover Amazon Prime Air, but the FAA has already said in their road map there are going significant restrictions on where and when and how those things can fly.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But perhaps more importantly for Amazon Prime Air, Waite said, are the parts of the road map which make clear that autonomous drones aren&#39;t in the cards any time soon. Bezos said Amazon Prime Air drones would be &quot;autonomous,&quot; using GPS coordinates to navigate. But according to Waite, the FAA road map says &quot;there will have to be a pilot in command of the device at all times, which pretty much blows Bezos&#39;s dream of autonomous drones carrying packages out of the water.&quot; Waite believes autonomous operations are &quot;way down the road,&quot; with a best guess of 2020 or 2024 — later than the timeline laid out by Bezos of as little as five years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even others who are more optimistic about Bezos&#39;s plan note this is a significant hurdle. Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor, told my colleague Timothy B. Lee yesterday that he thinks Amazon Air is feasible, but &quot;it&#39;s likely that a person would have to be in the loop initially&quot; to pilot the devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Autonomous operations raise a lot of safety questions for the FAA, especially in highly populated areas, Waite said: &quot;You&#39;re talking about eight spinning blades that you are now, by design, putting very near to people.&quot; Proposing flying those drones automatically through cities or above crowded public events is a safety hazard that the FAA is not going to take lightly, said Waite, adding that &quot;it&#39;s all fun and games until little Sally loses a finger.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And because it needs to consider the long-term implications for national air space, he expects the FAA to be working on a much more extended time frame than Bezos realizes. To illustrate his point, he noted just how long it took for the agency to approve limited electronic devices on airplanes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But while Amazon was able to lobby effectively on that issue, Waite doesn&#39;t think they will have the same level of sway on drones — even after such a splashy move to get attention in the space. &quot;There are defense contractors and major agricultural companies that are jumping up and down and screaming on this stuff and the FAA is not moving,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;I just don&#39;t think in comparison to the defense industrial complex and big agriculture, Amazon is much of a player.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Bezos owns The Washington Post.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On one of the busiest online-shopping days of the year, the Supreme Court declined Monday to get involved in state efforts to force Web retailers such as Amazon.com to collect sales tax from customers even in places where the companies do not have a physical presence.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The multibillion-dollar issue — which could end tax-free online shopping for many Americans — is one of the most important in modern retailing. Traditional bricks-and-mortar businesses say the online retailers receive an unfair advantage by not having to collect sales taxes in some areas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All but five states impose sales taxes on purchases, whether online or not, and an increasing number have passed legislation to force online retailers such as Overstock.com and eBay to begin collecting those taxes from customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The court&#39;s decision to stay out of the issue for now may put more pressure on Congress to come up with a national solution, as both online and traditional retailers complain about a patchwork of state laws and conflicting lower-court decisions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The failure of the court to take and decide this case will create an additional burden on interstate commerce since the line between a physical and virtual presence will only continue to blur,&quot; said David C. Blum, a Chicago tax lawyer who represents online retailers and traditional businesses. &quot;We can only hope that the court will take other similar cases in the near future&quot; to settle the issue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Customers in states with sales taxes are supposed to remit the tax on purchases they make from online retailers. But few do. The National Conference of State Legislatures estimated in 2012 that states lost $23 billion in uncollected taxes of all types and that about half were from online sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As is its custom, the court gave no explanation for turning down petitions from Amazon and Overstock to review a decision by New York&#39;s highest court to uphold that state&#39;s 2008 law requiring sales tax collections.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seattle-based Amazon has no offices, distribution centers or workforce in New York. But the New York Court of Appeals said the company&#39;s relationship with third-party affiliates in the state that receive commissions for sending Web traffic its way satisfied the &quot;substantial nexus&quot; necessary to force the company to collect taxes. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overstock Executive Vice President Jonathan Johnson said that he was disappointed by the court&#39;s action and that his company thinks it has &quot;no obligation to be the tax collector for the state of New York.&quot; Overstock suspended its relationship with affiliates in the state that would have made it subject to the New York law.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman (D) had urged the court to stay out of the fight while elected officials continue to address it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Today&#39;s Supreme Court decision validates New York&#39;s efforts to treat both online and brick-and-mortar retailers equally and fairly, by requiring all retailers with a presence in our state to collect sales taxes,&quot; he said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It has been more than 20 years since the Supreme Court ruled in Quill v. North Dakota that a state&#39;s efforts to require tax collections from out-of-state companies violated the Constitution&#39;s commerce clause. It said the necessary &quot;substantial nexus&quot; exists when the out-of-state retailer has a &quot;physical presence&quot; in the state.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But that decision came before a revolution in online shopping, and the New York court said the old test may be outdated.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;An entity may now have a profound impact upon a foreign jurisdiction solely through its virtual projection via the Internet,&quot; the court ruled.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To underscore the judicial conflict over the issue, Illinois&#39; top court last month struck down its state law, which was modeled after New York&#39;s, but for different legal reasons. A spokeswoman for the Illinois attorney general said no decision has been made about whether to appeal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ability to make sales without collecting sales tax has benefited Amazon and other online retailers, and the company has been fighting the state efforts one at a time. But as Amazon has been building distribution centers nationwide to deliver goods more quickly, it has more often met the physical presence requirement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to its Web site, Amazon now collects sales taxes in 16 states, including Virginia and the country&#39;s two most populous: California and Texas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Supreme Court&#39;s Quill decision said Congress was in a better position than the court to provide uniformity in state tax collection requirements, but little progress has been made. The federal government does not impose sales taxes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As Amazon has been collecting the tax in more states, the company has split with other online retailers to advocate for a uniform federal law.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Senate in the spring passed the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013, which would require companies that exceed $1 million in Internet sales outside the states where they are located to collect every state&#39;s sales tax.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the future of the bill is uncertain in the House. Some House Republicans said agreeing with the Senate bill would result in tax increases for constituents.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In response to Monday&#39;s development, Amazon said in a statement: &quot;The Supreme Court already has addressed the sales tax issue, saying in Quill that Congress can and should act to resolve it. The Marketplace Fairness Act now pending before Congress would protect states&#39; rights to make their own revenue policy choices while allowing them to collect more than a fraction of the revenue that&#39;s already owed.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:robert.barnes@washpost.com">robert.barnes@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020131202e9c2003h1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark96">innovations</a><a name="bookmark97">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon drones: A flying robot may deliver your Christmas gifts in four or five years</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Matt McFarland 238 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3 December 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Lee 460 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3 December 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeffrey P. Bezos has never been known for thinking small. And in an interview aired Sunday on CBS&#39;s &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; he outlined his latest plan for revolutionizing the retail industry: using drones to deliver packages in as little as 30 minutes. Declaring himself an &quot;optimist,&quot; the Amazon.com founder and chief executive predicted the technology could be brought to market in as little as five years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is more than a theoretical idea. Bezos showed CBS&#39;s Charlie Rose a working prototype of an eight-rotor helicopter drone called an &quot;octocopter.&quot; Emblazoned with &quot;Amazon Prime Air,&quot; the flying robot has a claw at the bottom that allows it to scoop up packages at Amazon fulfillment centers and carry them to customers&#39; front lawns:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington who has written extensively about drones, said that this is precisely the kind of application Congress had in mind in 2012 when it ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to open the sky to commercial drones. There are strict limits on the use of drones for commercial purposes, but that is scheduled to change soon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;By 2015, the FAA has to come up with a set of rules that integrates just the kind of thing that Amazon is talking about&quot; into the national airspace, Calo said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon will have to convince federal regulators that the technology is safe and that it wouldn&#39;t lead to excessive congestion. &quot;If what Amazon proposes doesn&#39;t feel safe, the FAA could get worried about the prospect of these things falling out of the sky,&quot; Calo said. In his &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview, Bezos said that the prototype octocopter has redundant motors so it can stay in the air even if one fails.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Calo said the FAA may be skittish about allowing fully automated drones in the sky. At least initially, the agency might require that a human guide the drones remotely during deliveries. That might initially drive up the cost of the service, limiting its use to customers willing to pay a premium.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Technological issues also could limit the technology&#39;s value in the next few years. According to Calo, the current generation of autonomous flying machines can carry only a few pounds and stay in the air for about 15 minutes. That means that it probably wouldn&#39;t be possible to serve an entire metropolitan area from a single fulfillment center.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon may be able to overcome both obstacles in the long run.

The idea seems so crazy that it&#39;s bound to raise a few questions. Is it really possible? What kind of obstacles will Amazon chief executive (and Washington Post owner) Jeffrey P. Bezos have to overcome? And how will his plan shape the future of drone technology?

The idea seems so crazy, it&#39;s bound to raise a few questions. Is it really possible? What kind of obstacles will Amazon chief executive (and Washington Post owner) Jeffrey Bezos have to overcome? And how will his plan shape the future of drone technology? Answers to these and more are below.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In as soon as five years, Amazon says, it&#39;s going to field a fleet of drones that will deliver anything you order - as long as it&#39;s less than five pounds - in minutes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conveniently, Amazon has giant distribution centers scattered across the country. Most of the company&#39;s deliveries start out from these facilities; the drones would cut out the truck drivers who deliver your packages today.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Traditional retailers compete on the strength of their products. But Amazon increasingly is competing on the basis of time - fulfilling our wishes as close to instantaneously as possible. The drone strategy promises to cut what&#39;s now a one- or two-day shipping window down to 30 minutes or less. Drones have an advantage over delivery trucks in that they can use a more direct route, rather than having to follow winding streets. That saves time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos has said that the drones will be able to carry a five-pound payload for about 10 miles. A 15-minute flight out, followed by a 15-minute flight back, would call for average speeds of 40 mph. That&#39;s pretty zippy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is essentially a physics problem: The larger your payload, the more lift you need. The more lift you need, the larger your battery has to be, which further adds to the weight, which adds to the power requirements, and so on.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After analyzing Amazon&#39;s promotional video, Christopher Vo - a robotics researcher at George Mason University - estimates that Amazon&#39;s &quot;octocopter&quot; drone probably uses a 10,000-mAh, 22-volt lithium ion polymer battery made up of six or 10 cells. These batteries are a lot like the ones that power a laptop, except that their chemistry allows for a much greater energy draw. You can find these on hobbyist Web sites. In fact, according to Vo, you can buy an octocopter resembling the one in Amazon&#39;s video for about $24,000.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s possible, but improbable, at least for now. Some private drones can carry more than 12 pounds. But in a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview Sunday, Bezos acknowledged that &quot;we&#39;re not going to deliver kayaks or table saws that way.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Where we might actually see faster progress is in the way that companies ship things internally. Big 747s and other cargo planes can already fly on autopilot, for the most part. From there, it&#39;s not too far of a leap to convert them into fully autonomous aircraft.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s optimistic but not unrealistic. A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration says that while current rules prohibit Amazon from rolling this out today, a three-to-five-year target &quot;kind of lines up&quot; with an FAA process to relax those regulations. Last month, the agency released a road map charting out how those regulations will be</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">rewritten. By August, the FAA expects to have rules ready for consumer drones, followed by guidelines for commercial drones a few years later.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here&#39;s something else to think about: The United States may not be the best place to test this program. Timothy Reuter, who heads a D.C.-based drone hobbyist group, says Canada might be an attractive choice. &quot;It&#39;s not so far away, but they&#39;re much more permissive,&quot; Reuter says.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Human pilots instinctively know to avoid trees and buildings. Drones don&#39;t. For that, they need something called sense-and-avoid technology - which is pretty good at the moment, but not so good that we can trust a machine to fly itself exclusively. Until then, Amazon will probably hire drone pilots to fly each drone. Then it might graduate to a system where one overseer is monitoring a handful of machines at once from a control center.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another way to solve the problem, Vo says, is to reduce the number of variables that the drone will have to contend with near the ground. You could do this by building some kind of helipad on rooftops. Maybe those will even become standard on new homes so that other companies - FedEx, UPS, etc. - could take advantage of them, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whoa, okay. That actually points to something else Amazon will have to think about - how to protect its unmanned vehicles. Residents of one Colorado town have even considered giving out hunting permits for unmanned vehicles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then there&#39;s the question of how to secure the data link between Amazon&#39;s drones and the ground control station that monitors them. You don&#39;t want your delivery to get hacked and stolen, or worse - turned into a flying weapon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s a possibility. But remember, this future is still years away. Amazon&#39;s experiment with drone technology suggests it may be looking at drones as simply one part of a broader delivery system that integrates multiple technologies. There are other emerging new technologies, such as 3-D printing and self-driving cars, that might help Amazon tighten up any lags in its supply chain and get items to consumers more quickly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20131203drones1203</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020131203e9c30000d</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark102">Technology</a><a name="bookmark103">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Supreme Court deals setback on sales taxes; Amazon reveals drone delivery plans; The Supreme Court‘s decision came a day after CBS revealed Amazon’s plans for delivery via drones.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Max Ehrenfreund 185 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2 December 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Anne Eisenberg at the New York Times writes about the increasingly real possibility of technology reading facial expressions. &quot;With face-reading software, a computer&#39;s webcam might spot the confused expression of an online student and provide extra tutoring. Or computer-based games with built-in cameras could register how people are reacting to each move in the game and ramp up the pace if they seem bored,&quot; she explains. &quot;But the rapidly developing technology is far from infallible, and it raises many questions about privacy and surveillance.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patent trolls have a surprising ally: universities. Our own Timothy B. Lee writes about an interesting letter opposing legislation aimed at curbing patent trolling signed by some academic groups. &quot;Essentially, the universities are concerned that the legislation would make it harder for patent holders to enforce their patents.&quot; And they have a point: &quot;The line between patent trolls and other patent holders isn&#39;t always clear, so any reform designed to make patent trolling more difficult is also going to inconvenience many conventional patent holders — including universities.&quot; However, he argues that the patent practices of universities sometimes mean &quot;maximizing licensing revenue rather than maximizing benefit to the public.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The White House says it met its Obamacare goal.

And in an interview aired Sunday on CBS&#39;s &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; he outlined his latest plan for revolutionizing the retail industry: using drones to deliver packages in as little as 30 minutes. Declaring himself an &quot;optimist,&quot; the Amazon.com founder and chief executive predicted the technology could be brought to market in as little as five years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is more than a theoretical idea. Bezos showed CBS&#39;s Charlie Rose a working prototype of an eight-rotor helicopter drone called an &quot;octocopter.&quot; Emblazoned with &quot;Amazon Prime Air,&quot; the flying robot has a claw at the bottom that allows it to scoop up packages at Amazon fulfillment centers and carry them to customers&#39; front lawns.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington who has written extensively about drones, said this is precisely the kind of application Congress had in mind in 2012 when it ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to open the sky to commercial drones. There are strict limits on the use of drones for commercial purposes, but that is scheduled to change soon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;By 2015, the FAA has to come up with a set of rules that integrates just the kind of thing that Amazon is talking about&quot; into the national airspace, Calo said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon will have to convince federal regulators that the technology is safe and that it wouldn&#39;t lead to excessive congestion. &quot;If what Amazon proposes doesn&#39;t feel safe, the FAA could get worried about the prospect of these things falling out of the sky,&quot; Calo said. In his &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview, Bezos said that the prototype octocopter has redundant motors so it can stay in the air even if one fails.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Bezos owns The Washington Post.

All Rights Reserved Four retailers to watch this holiday season</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s December, and that can only mean that it will be that much harder to find a parking spot at the mall. There&#39;s also the cruel calendar that planted last week&#39;s Black Friday at the latest possible date in November. Why do you think so many chains were scrambling to open on Thanksgiving this year?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There will be plenty to watch given the abridged holiday shopping season. Let&#39;s take a closer look at four retailers that investors will be watching closely this month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Department store chains not named J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) should be taking advantage of the weakened rival this season, and Macy&#39;s is already making the most of the situation. It reported better-than-expected quarterly results last month with sales at department stores open at least a year up an impressive 3.5 percent. Macy&#39;s came through with a profit of 47 cents a share, blowing away the profit of 39 cents a share that analysts were forecasting. This is just the kind of momentum that investors like to see heading into the telltale holiday shopping season.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The leading online retailer has been taking advantage of its low overhead and efficient fulfillment to deliver</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">all-weather growth over the years. [Founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns Capital Business and The Washington Post.] Things shouldn&#39;t be any different this time around as Wall Street&#39;s counting on sales to soar 22 percent during the holiday quarter with profitability more than tripling for the period. Amazon&#39;s brazen entry into consumer electronics a few years ago now finds it the leading maker of e-readers and a fast-growing player in entry-level tablets.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s low prices should continue to serve it well in an economy that&#39;s showing signs of life with more shoppers armed with smartphones to compare prices before they buy something in the real world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Mac maker ended its 2013 fiscal year on Sept. 30 in mixed fashion. Revenue improved 4 percent while earnings per share actually fell 5 percent. Call it the law of large numbers at work: Apple sold $171 billion worth of product in fiscal 2013 and hosted some 400 million customers at its stores. Will above-average growth return in first quarter? The new iPad Air and long-awaited iPad Mini with Retina Display are cause for hope, even if analysts predict meager holiday sales. Don&#39;t place too much faith in their skepticism: Apple destroyed estimates in last year&#39;s first quarter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What had been a nice 2013 rally turned south recently when Best Buy admitted that sustained price cuts needed to take on Amazon could take a toll on results in future quarters. A fresh round of exclusive products, such as Samsung&#39;s Blue Arctic Galaxy S4 smartphone, could help spur growth during the dip. For now, though, the blue crew&#39;s results are all green: $9.36 billion in third-quarter revenue and 18 cents a share in earnings, easily besting Wall Street&#39;s 12-cent a share target. Same-store sales rose 0.3 percent internationally and 1.7 percent at U.S. locations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20131202motley1202</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020131202e9c20002e</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark110">Technology</a><a name="bookmark111">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Where to get Black Friday deals on ‘Call of Duty,’ ‘GTA,’ ‘Assassin’s Creed,’ ‘BioShock’; Major retailers are offering deals this week on “Call of Duty: Ghosts,” “Grand Theft Auto V,” and other titles.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Max Ehrenfreund 325 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26 November 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With same-day delivery services, Internet retailers such as Wal-Mart, eBay and Amazon.com are experimenting with ways to give online shoppers something close to instant gratification.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For $5, eBay Now allows customers to get local goods delivered in &quot;about an hour.&quot; Wal-Mart, which is testing its same-day service in Northern Virginia and other areas, delivers items for up to $10 per purchase. And Amazon&#39;s same-day deliveries cost as little as $3.99 per shipment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although such services could upend the way consumers shop in the long term, analysts say that the nascent offerings are unlikely to make a dent in holiday shopping patterns this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;People just don&#39;t really understand what it is and why they need it yet,&quot; said Matt Nemer, a senior retail analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to the National Retail Federation, only 4.2 percent of consumers used same-day delivery frequently during last year&#39;s holiday shopping crush, and only 7.2 percent used the service once or twice.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts said that consumer psyche is part of the reason: Most have decided they don&#39;t need their items right away.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Same-day delivery is sort of more of a novelty item rather than a structural thing that&#39;s going to make people buy more,&quot; said Adrienne Tennant, a retail analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The growth of same-day delivery also depends on the size of the potential customer base. And the services are available only in a few densely populated urban areas. Amazon, for example, offers same-day delivery in 11 metropolitan areas, while eBay Now is offered only in San Francisco, New York and Chicago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We haven&#39;t hit enough cities with it and enough areas with it,&quot; said Gene Alvarez, vice president and retail analyst at Gartner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although Web-only retailers have been early innovators of same-day delivery offerings, analysts said that retailers with many brick-and-mortar stores and large inventories may benefit most from this model.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Unless you&#39;re a large brick-and-mortar retailer with a lot of locations, it&#39;s tough to offer that and still make a good margin off that,&quot; said Sean Whitehouse, a partner in the retail practice at consulting firm Kurt Salmon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although a relatively small share of shoppers are expected to use same-day delivery this holiday season, analysts say it will eventually gain traction as retailers expand and improve the experiences of those who use the service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Also, millennials are more likely than other shoppers to use same-day delivery, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2012, 12.4 percent of consumers ages 18 to 34 used the service, and an additional 17 percent used it occasionally, compared with 4.2 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, of all shoppers. Since this generation is just beginning to exercise its purchasing power, their interest in same-day delivery also suggests that demand could grow for the service over time, the trade group said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Men are more likely than women to be regular users of same-day delivery during the holiday season, with 6.3 percent of men and 2.4 percent of women using the service last year, the trade group said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The National Retail Federation forecasts that holiday sales will rise 3.9 percent, to $602.1 billion, up from last year&#39;s growth of 3.5 percent. Online sales, however, could increase as much as 15 percent, to $82 billion, according to the trade group.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:sarah.halzack@washpost.com">sarah.halzack@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.

Quentin Hardy at the New York Time&#39;s Bits blog covers recent remarks from James Hamilton, vice president and distinguished engineer at Amazon Web Services, about the company&#39;s</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">cloud-computing efforts. Amazon&#39;s cloud storage system reportedly &quot;handles 1.5 million requests a second, and holds trillions of &#39;objects,&#39; or individual stored items&quot; and is &quot;building its own specialized computers, data storage systems, networking systems, even power substations and optical transmissions systems.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here&#39;s why Airbnb isn&#39;t worried about New York&#39;s crackdown. Our own Brian Fung interviewed Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk, who says Airbnb facilitates some 150,000 sleeping arrangements per night. They spoke about new features, the data they collect, and current legal issues in New York City, where the attorney general is concerned that some landlords are abusing the service and renting their properties illegally.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Everyone agrees this cell phone rule is dumb. So why haven&#39;t we done anything about it? Fung again takes on why Congress hasn&#39;t fixed cell phone unlocking, the rule by which it is illegal to switch your cell phone carrier while using the same device. &quot;Last year, the Library of Congress decided not to renew an exemption for cellphone-unlocking under the nation&#39;s copyright laws, overturning a six-year history of approving the practice and creating today&#39;s impasse in the process,&quot; Fung explains. But now there&#39;s been no progress to change the rule. &quot;What makes the situation even less comprehensible is how much everyone seems to agree this is a stupid rule,&quot; writes Fung. &quot;The White House thinks so. Congress thinks so. And now, the nation&#39;s top telecom regulator thinks so, too.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Snap out of it: Kids aren&#39;t reliable tech predictors. Farhad Manjoo at the Wall Street Journal is skeptical of Snapchat -- at least partially because he does not think the current clientele are the best predictors of tech success. &quot;I believe the children aren&#39;t our future. Teach them well, but when it comes to determining the next big thing in tech, let&#39;s not fall victim to the ridiculous idea that they lead the way.&quot; Many major innovations haven&#39;t done well with teens initially due to price barriers, he said. In addition, the teen years are often plagued by fads. &quot;Is the app just a youthful fad, just another boy band, or is it something more permanent; is it the Beatles?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still on Facebook, but Finding Less to Like. Speaking of social media, Jenna Wortham at The New York Times asks a question a lot us keep thinking about: &quot;is it just me, or is Facebook fading?&quot; Describing her own behavior, Wortham says, &quot;my formerly hyperactive Facebook life has slowed to a crawl. I&#39;ve found that most of my younger relatives have graduated from high school and have deleted their accounts or whittled them down until there is barely any personal information left. As for my own account, I rarely add photographs or post updates about what I&#39;ve been doing.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020131118e9bi0030d</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark116">Style</a><a name="bookmark117">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">&#39;Alpha House&#39;:A familiar castof caricatures</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hank Stuever 982 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">18 November 2013 The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL C01</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Garry Trudeau&#39;s &quot;Alpha House,&quot; a half-hour comedy series that&#39;s now streaming for your fickle platform pleasure on Amazon.com, is about four Republican senators who are roommates in a Capitol Hill townhouse.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Everything about &quot;Alpha House&quot; looks good to go at first. It has the right cast, led by John Goodman; it has a studied understanding that modern comedy must put abject humiliation and awkwardness above all other forms of humor; it is written so that characters speak in smart spurts of cutting hatefulness; it easily accommodates a series of boldface names who make cameo appearances as either characters or as themselves; and most of all, it has at its helm Trudeau, the &quot;Doonesbury&quot; creator who can lay claim to a formative work of TV political comedy (HBO&#39;s ancient &quot;Tanner &#39;88,&quot; a collaboration with Robert Altman).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Strangely, the one element &quot;Alpha House&quot; is missing is hilarity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As in LOL, as in the kind of laughter you can hear coming from the person in the other room who is watching the show on his iPa - excuse me, his Kindle Fire. (Obligatorily, I must note here that The Washington Post is now owned by the guy who founded Amazon. But you know that.) The show is so tight - maybe too tight - that it starts to choke on its own power-tie premise in the first three episodes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Part of &quot;Alpha House&#39;s&quot; burden to bear is that it feels about 15 crucial minutes late to the raging bonfire that is now Washington parody. This territory is already well-scorched - lately by HBO&#39;s cruelly unerring &quot;Veep,&quot; but also by Netflix&#39;s stylish and utterly cynical &quot;House of Cards&quot; (meant to be a drama, yet easily ingested as satire, like ABC&#39;s &quot;Scandal&quot;), as well as the familiar, nightly whippings that Beltway and media culture receive from Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A more pressing challenge (perhaps also a boon) to launching yet another show about Washington&#39;s absurd ineptitude is that you have to compete with actual headlines, including but not limited to debt ceilings, shutdowns, partisan gridlock and, of course, federal Web site rollouts. There&#39;s never been a better time to strike, except for the long line of people already doing it. The mockery of This Town - as portrayed in the best-selling book &quot;This Town&quot; - can easily get as old as the subject being mocked.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Colbert, whose show factors into one of &quot;Alpha House&#39;s&quot; establishing plots, is kind of a spirit guide for &quot;Alpha House,&quot; which, like &quot;The Colbert Report,&quot; sends up Republican politics with characters who are themselves unwaveringly Republican.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thus we enter a somewhat nuanced and sarcastic exploration of greed, piggishness and double standards on social and sexual mores - all of it played for laughs rather than outrage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Goodman is North Carolina Sen. Gil John Biggs, a profane politician coasting mainly on his former glory as a basketball coach, which has guaranteed him a long life in Washington - or so he thinks. His roomies include the townhouse&#39;s fussy owner, Sen. Louis Laffer of Nevada (Matt Malloy), a married Mormon struggling to maintain appearances (the viewer is to understand that he&#39;s a closet case hiding his homosexuality). Laffer&#39;s reelection has turned into an uphill battle now that he&#39;s facing a primary race against a macho, gun-toting rival; Biggs, too, is facing a serious challenger and must reluctantly rediscover his dwindling charm reserves.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, Pennsylvania Sen. Robert Bettencourt (played by &quot;The Wire&#39;s&quot; Clark Johnson) swaggers along a fine line: He&#39;s a powerful black Republican whose gift for graft has him going before grand juries and the Senate&#39;s</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ethics committee. Lastly, the senators are joined by a new housemate who can outshine and out-slime them all: the freshly divorced, skirt-chasing Florida Sen. Andy Guzman (Mark Consuelos), whose invincible sense of entitlement has him eyeing the White House.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Through these four men, Trudeau and company have landed on a set of updated, if nevertheless derisively stereotypical, portrayals of GOP hubris - as when the four senators make a publicity trip to Afghanistan and are compelled (through PAC contributors) to entrust their safety to a private-sector paramilitary escort instead of the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. military.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The most interesting (and pathetic) character is Malloy&#39;s Sen. Laffer, who can&#39;t catch a break: A self-effacing trip to &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; suddenly devolves when the TV host challenges Laffer to a wrestling match; he winds up with a face full of Colbert&#39;s crotch.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like Julia Louis-Dreyfus&#39;s vice president on &quot;Veep,&quot; the men of &quot;Alpha House&quot; each struggle to keep ahead of the Twittersphere&#39;s light-speed effect on political currency; Goodman says that something has &quot;gone virile&quot; online; Laffer has to call a staffer to ask what a &quot;meme&quot; is. It&#39;s all a little bit funny, but, again, it&#39;s not the sort of funny in which you repeat the best lines to your friends.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The way the &quot;Alpha House&quot; men go about business on the Hill could be interpreted as flattery to the Republicans (especially in the Goodman character&#39;s unabashed confidence in his conservative views), perhaps as much as it can be seen as the insult the show ultimately intends to be. After all, Trudeau and company are promoting the party&#39;s fondest big-tent desires: Here&#39;s a black guy, a gay-ish guy, a Latino guy, a fat Southern guy - it&#39;s all the elephants in one room, sharing rent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this age of constantly morphing rules about publicity and shame, the Republicans should know exactly how to treat &quot;Alpha House&quot;: as a Valentine.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/alphahouse" class="a" target="_blank">Alpha House (11 half-hour episodes) streaming at </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">www.amazon.com/alphahouse</span>.

All Rights Reserved. And on the seventh day, there was delivery.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Already, work e-mails and conference calls have become part of Sunday routines, piling on top of sports tournaments, errands and homework. Now, with Amazon.com&#39;s plans to deliver packages on Sundays, one more barrier falls, inching that day even closer to becoming just another part of the consumer week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The tradition of a seventh day set aside for family and rest has been crumbling for years as states relaxed laws prohibiting gambling, shopping and even hunting on Sundays. The popularity of smartphones and the creation of an always-online culture has spurred greater demand — and ability — to have it all, right now, anytime.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We are moving toward a society where e-mail and social media have caused the week and weekend to blur,&quot; said Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics and labor at MIT.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Blue laws&quot; that ban Sunday activities — dating to the 1600s — have been gradually repealed in many states, but some remain. In Maryland, car sales on Sundays are widely banned, though they are allowed in Montgomery, Prince George&#39;s and Howard counties.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sunday hunting is banned in many states. In Virginia, the rules are more specific: Hunting with firearms or other weapons is banned on Sundays, though raccoons may be hunted until 2 a.m.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As cities and states look for more revenue, they have loosened laws banning liquor sales on Sundays. The D.C. Council approved a plan to allow them late last year, and liquor stores in Montgomery County were allowed to sell on Sundays starting in 2010. A new law that took effect last year in Virginia allowed state-run stores in small communities to start selling alcohol on Sundays</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s national plan to partner with the U.S. Postal Service could open the door to a wave of Sunday deliveries by other companies. The money-losing Postal Service, which recently was trying to persuade Congress to halt Saturday mail, said it will expand Sunday staffing and hopes to sign up more clients. The agency declined to disclose specifics or to reveal how much new revenue it expects.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There were no complaints about prolonging the workweek from a union representing letter carriers. &quot;We&#39;re excited about the potential of the rapidly growing e-commerce market and what it means for the Postal Service,&quot; said Fredric Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers. Expanding Sunday service &quot;would benefit the economy, consumers, businesses and the nation as a whole,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon said its plan originated from consumer demands to get their online orders faster.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We hope it crosses an errand or two off the weekend to-do list,&quot; Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competitors such as Wal-Mart, eBay and Google are racing to satisfy consumers virtually around the clock, aiming to deliver products just hours after someone places an online order.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Amazon&#39;s announcement is another incremental development in the erosion of that restful space — Sunday — and another example of an erosion on the limits of market activity,&quot; said Jordan J. Ballor, a research fellow at the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, an economic think tank.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The changes of shopping patterns began well before online commerce took off. Wal-Mart, Kmart and other major retailers were criticized when they started opening their stores on Sundays years ago. Since then, they have expanded shopping hours to 24 hours a day and holidays. They have faced renewed backlash over plans to open on Thanksgiving Day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last year, an employee of Target wrote a letter to company chief executive Gregg W. Steinhafel, asking him to close the chain of stores on Thanksgiving. The letter was posted as a petition on Change.org and got more than 300,000 signatures of support.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company stood by its decision to open on Thanksgiving evening, saying it was responding to the interests of shoppers and of employees who asked to work the overtime shifts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In an age of constant commerce, consumers have struggled to reconcile their urge to spend with older traditions of quiet Sundays. Last month, some residents of Bergen County, N.J., tried to repeal a county ban on the sale of furniture, clothing and electronics on Sundays. They had argued that opening retail stores seven days a week would boost the local economy. But they failed to get enough signatures of support.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A few companies have resisted the seven-day trend. Chick-fil-A&#39;s 1,700 fast-food restaurants and Hobby Lobby&#39;s 560 craft stores are closed on Sundays.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chick-fil-A&#39;s founder believes that &quot;all franchised Chick-fil-A operators and their restaurant employees should have an opportunity to rest, spend time with family and friends, and worship if they choose to do so,&quot; according to a statement on the company&#39;s Web site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But such cases are rare. The combination of weaker labor unions, fewer blue laws and greater consumer demand has made it easier for companies to get away with e-mails during off-hours and stores open at all hours, said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California at Santa Barbara.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">&quot;This, combined with technology, has made the week endless,&quot; he said. </a><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com" target="_blank">cecilia.kang@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Jia Lynn Yang contributed to this report.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The news out this morning that Amazon.com had essentially hired the U.S. Postal Service to deliver on Sundays was both surprising and completely sensible.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The partnership of a floundering, old-world institution and perhaps the nation&#39;s most future-oriented tech company</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">— Amazon&#39;s strategy is to take losses today in the service of profits down the road — would at first seem incongruous. As my colleague Brian Fung outlined, though, teaming up for Sunday delivery gives both of them an edge over the competition that could force the rest of the industry to adapt.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And why stop there? Amazon and the USPS have lots more to gain from each other — so much so that an outright merger might maximize the best qualities of both.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s start with the situation of the USPS.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Postal Service has known for a while now that the economics of the shipping industry were changing such that it would have to make dramatic changes to stay afloat. A Boston Consulting Group study in 2009 mapped declining mail volumes out through the year 2020, when it calculated that the USPS would lose $15 billion in a single year — especially since revenue per delivery point would fall by 30 percent, as profitable first class-items disappear.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And yet, the Postal Service has been bettering itself. Even as overall revenue falls, it&#39;s been serving more delivery points and increasing income from &quot;negotiated service agreements&quot; with private companies. It&#39;s proven itself to be a decent innovator, keeping up with technology to move mail more efficiently. It has shed more than 200,000 employees over the past 10 years and is in a position to lose more, as about half are eligible for retirement. That should make it easier to bring down labor costs, which now make up some 80 percent of the USPS&#39; budget, compared to UPS and FedEx&#39;s respective 61 percent and 43 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The biggest problems for the Postal Service today are the overhang of pension and retiree health benefit obligations, which totaled $96 billion at the end of 2012, and endless congressional wrangling over how it should operate. Although it&#39;s managed to reduce 21,000 routes and consolidate some mail processing facilities, pleas to close unprofitable post offices and cut Saturday delivery always run into a wall of &quot;no,&quot; and substantial changes to the business model — like the ability to offer &quot;non-postal&quot; services — are subject to legislative approval. That&#39;s led to a consistent drumbeat of calls for the USPS&#39; privatization, which has been happening gradually for decades anyway, and which most of Europe has already accomplished. The question is just how to pull it off.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, let&#39;s turn to Amazon. The company has been investing heavily in ways to deliver more products faster, cheaper, and farther than the competition, including dozens of warehouses in the U.S., a fleet of trucks, and even &quot;lockers&quot; for people to pick up their goods at local convenience stores. It&#39;s expensive: Fulfillment costs amounted to $1.96 billion, or 11.5 percent of revenue, last quarter alone. Amazon considers it an investment in the future, as part of its strategy to provide anything customers might need as fast as they could possibly get it (as well as a tax strategy, since it knows it&#39;ll lose the benefits of lacking a physical presence in states soon anyway). The embodiment of this gambit is AmazonFresh, which doesn&#39;t yet make a profit, but is supposed to ease the transition towards delivering more and more goods.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Owning the Postal Service would get Amazon the rest of the way there. It&#39;s got 31,000 post offices and 461 mail processing centers, which represent significant excess capacity. The USPS is still the best last-mile mail delivery service provider, and Amazon is perhaps the most aggressive warehousing logistics innovator, which could</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">enable a partnership — similar to one proposed by a group of former postal leaders and partly approved by the National Academy of Public Administration — that would leverage the strengths of both.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Of course, there are important questions to ask about the public role of the USPS in delivering the mail to everyone, wherever they might be, even if doing so costs more than it&#39;s able to charge. But there are other examples of former government monopolies that have gone private on the condition that they maintain a degree of universal service, like the phone system (the benefits of the resulting telecom duopoly are debatable, but it&#39;s probably better than still having Ma Bell).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another concern: Wouldn&#39;t it be problematic to hand a monopoly to a private company? Well, the new Amazon Postal Service could also be required to offer its services to other companies at competitive rates, as it already does with its rapidly expanding network of data centers. Meanwhile, competition is already shaping up: EBay has partnered with FedEx, and it&#39;s not hard to imagine Wal-Mart doing the same with UPS.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sure, there are still a lot of details to be worked out; the Postal Service isn&#39;t Amazon&#39;s typical rinky dink acquisition, and the financials could be challenging even for CEO Jeff Bezos&#39;s ever-permissive investors. But with no obvious fix in sight, it&#39;s worth keeping all options on the table.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For most people, waiting at home for a package to be delivered is largely infeasible during the workweek, leaving Saturday as their best hope for catching the parcel truck. But thanks to Amazon, consumers can now get their</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-commerce shipments on Sundays, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The shift is great news for online shoppers. It&#39;s likely to be even better for the U.S. Postal Service, the unlikely agency responsible for those weekend deliveries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In case you haven&#39;t heard, the Postal Service is in trouble. The service&#39;s losses have already amounted to $3.9 billion this year, thanks in part to a legal requirement that it funnel vast amounts of money into a health pension program for its workers every year. Another problem? People are sending less mail. By the end of the decade, according to a federal study, mail volumes will be about where they were in the 1980s.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon could have offered to pay the Postal Service for carrying more of its packages generally, and USPS would have gotten a much-needed injection of cash. That&#39;s not what the deal is about, though. What makes the Amazon agreement so marvelous is the way it turns the symbol of a bygone era into an actual agent of disruption.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By launching Sunday deliveries, the Postal Service has moved to where its longtime competitors aren&#39;t. Hardly anybody in any industry delivers on Sunday, with the exception of newspapers. As a business idea, this makes total sense — and while USPS doesn&#39;t exactly threaten FedEx or UPS, it might cause those companies to strike agreements with other e-commerce businesses. The deal will effectively shake up the shipping industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The other reason it&#39;s disruptive? This is one of the few cases we&#39;ve seen of what we&#39;ll call reverse contracting — when the private sector hires a government agency to fill its need rather than the other way around. We haven&#39;t seen much of this, in part because there are so few publicly run, consumer-facing services like USPS at the federal level. There&#39;s Amtrak, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and a handful of others. But the pact between Amazon and USPS might open the door to further reverse contracting. If this venture takes off, Amazon may unintentionally wind up pioneering a new model for public-private partnerships.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The deal with Amazon won&#39;t single-handedly save USPS. And at this point, officials from both parties are keeping quiet about the terms of the agreement. But it puts the Postal Service in an aggressive posture that&#39;s as refreshing as it is surprising.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: The founder and CEO of Amazon.com Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Internet has been blamed for the death of the mail, but now it&#39;s offering hope to the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon announced Monday that it will begin Sunday deliveries using the government agency&#39;s fleet of foot soldiers, office workers and truck drivers to bring packages to homes seven days a week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To accommodate the online retailing giant, the Postal Service said it will for the first time deliver packages at regular rates on Sundays. Previously, a shipper had to use its pricey Express Mail service and pay an extra fee for Sunday delivery.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The initiative will begin immediately in Los Angeles and New York and spread to the Washington area and much of the rest of the nation next year, Postal Service officials said. The partnership should help the turnaround effort underway at the financially strapped Postal Service, they said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The USPS has seen its volume of letters drop by half in the past decade as Americans increasingly pay bills online and use Web chat, texting and social media to stay in touch. The Postal Service is asking Congress for the authority to let it drop Saturday delivery of letters but keep weekend shipment of packages so it can continue to exploit the growth of online commerce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;As online shopping continues to increase, the Postal Service is very happy to offer shippers like Amazon the option of having packages delivered on Sunday,&quot; Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The arrangement with Amazon could open the doors to more partnerships with retailers that are eager to use the 500,000 USPS employees and 31,000 post offices across the country to satisfy consumers who want to get what they buy online faster.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Postal Service said it would increase staffing in the locations where Amazon will offer the service, but did not offer specific numbers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The USPS also declined to comment on how much additional revenue the new initiative is expected to bring. In 2012, the number of packages the agency delivered rose to 3.5 billion, from 3.3 billion in 2011 and 3.1 billion in 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even so, the Postal Service lost $21 billion over the past two years — and predicts it will continue to operate deep in the red — largely because of the growing expense of delivering letters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Amazon, the partnership steps up a fierce battle to make online shopping closer to the instant-buying experience at bricks-and-mortar stores. In the near future, e-commerce is expected to deliver a variety of items — designer jeans or a jug of milk — within hours after an online order is placed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Wal-Mart, Google, eBay and others are experimenting with same-day delivery. Amazon has apilot project called Amazon Fresh, which offers grocery delivery in Los Angeles and Seattle, and plans to expand it nationwide.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With an eye on these efforts, the Postal Service began experimenting with same-day delivery in San Francisco.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For years, Amazon has wanted to deliver packages seven days a week but was stymied by the cost of getting packages from its distribution centers to doorsteps. United Parcel Service, FedEx and the USPS charges</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">consumers and businesses more to deliver on Sundays. In the new deal with Amazon, the Postal Service will not charge Amazon or its customers extra for Sunday shipments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This is part of a continuing effort to make online shopping anormal, seven-day-a-week,any-time-you-want experience,&quot; said Dave Clark, Amazon&#39;s vice president of worldwide operations and customer service. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts say Amazon has been willing to bear financial losses to expand its business. It sells its Kindle tablets at break-even prices or at a loss in the hopes that consumers will buy more books and other goods through the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-reader. It eats shipping costs for subscribers of its Prime membership service to get them to buy more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The firm wouldn&#39;t specify when the Sunday deliveries will be available for the Washington area, Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, Phoenix and other major metropolitan areas next year. Sunday service won&#39;t be available in Hawaii and Alaska, the USPS said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Postal Service said it will use its part-time employees, known as city carrier assistants and rural carrier associates, for the Sunday operations. If the volume of packages is projected to be large for a certain Sunday, the agency said it will increase its staffing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The agency doesn&#39;t need approval by Congress to expand its package delivery schedule to seven days.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;People want instant gratification,&quot; said Sue Brennan, a spokeswoman for the USPS. &quot;And letter writing, as wonderful as it is, and as good as a letter smells and feels, is a lost art.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon on Wednesday announced a new program, Amazon Source, aimed at persuading small retailers to sell Kindle e-readers and tablets in stores. The Bookseller Program is specifically targeted at independent bookstores</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- and appears to provide just enough rope for booksellers to hang themselves with.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon will sell the Kindles to the retailers at a modest 6 percent discount from the current MSRP and accessories at a 35 percent discount. The booksellers will then get their profit on the devices and add-ons, plus a 10 percent commission on the price of e-books purchased via their customers&#39; Kindle devices for the next two years. But the problem here is that if customers switch their primary literary consumption to e-books, they aren&#39;t as likely to buy as many physical books. And at the end of those two years when they earn a commission on a customer&#39;s Kindle purchases, the bookstores will probably still be out of a significant chunk of that consumer&#39;s business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Print books aren&#39;t as dead as they might seem. In fact, the most recent annual numbers show a mere 1 percent drop in physical book sales over the previous years. Plus, as my colleague Neil Irwin pointed out, there&#39;s a segment of consumers who read a handful of books per year and like to keep them on a shelf as trophies. And some segments, like visual children&#39;s books, currently don&#39;t translate as well to digital formats.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, bookstores are having a tough time. Bookstore sales fell 9.6 percent between 2007 and 2011. And bookstore sales from January through September of this year were down 2.6 percent from the same period last year.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consumers haven&#39;t stopped purchasing print books, but they are becoming increasingly likely to purchase through an e-tailer. You know, like Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This trend is analogous to the shift in the video market from physical media to streaming content. Or, for that matter, the shift from print newspapers to the Web. And it could be argued that Amazon is offering independent retailers a way to get a cut of those sales as they look for another business model -- like, say, turning into a coffee shop. But it&#39;s hard not to see the Amazon Source program as Amazon asking booksellers to help make themselves irrelevant.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">[Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.

Under the headline &quot;I wanted to like this book,&quot; she posted a 1-star (ouch) critique of &quot;The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,&quot; by Brad Stone, which has the tech world buzzing.

Here&#39;s why antitrust regulators don&#39;t care. ; In the age of Walmart and Amazon, office supply stores can merge all they want, and price competition will still exist.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Lydia DePillis 376 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 November 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Today, the Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation of an office supply super-merger: the combination of Office Depot and OfficeMax, which you&#39;d be forgiven for thinking were the same store anyway. They&#39;d been talking about it since early this year, and the FTC worried that the combination of two of the industry&#39;s biggest players might post a threat to competition. So they ran the numbers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There&#39;s some precedent for antitrust enforcement in this area. Back in 1997, the FTC denied a proposed merger between Staples and Office Depot, figuring the resulting giant would have too much control over the market. Now, the OfficeMax-Office Depot tie-up would create the biggest entity in that traditional space, with some $17.5 billion in combined annual sales. But guess what&#39;s happened between 1997 and now?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s right — the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lots of companies and individuals just order their highlighters and paper clips from Amazon.com these days, or pick them up from Walmart or Target, putting Staples, OfficeMax and Office Depot under intense pressure. In that kind of environment, no amount of consolidation in the office supply space could threaten prices, since the external competition is so fierce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s probably true of lots of industries, and signifies a shift in the antitrust landscape: When you have a couple super-retailers that sell everything anywhere as close to immediately as possible, other suppliers can basically get as big as they have to to survive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Until this was announced, everyone was like &#39;oh no, has the internet competition changed the competitive analysis enough to get antitrust approval?&#39;&quot; said Matt Reilly of Simpson Thatcher, who argued the case for Office Depot. &quot;This was a significant change.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ironically, for some of those kinds of companies, it&#39;s too late: Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble, for example, or Circuit City and Best Buy. They used to be the ones driving mom and pops out of business. Now they&#39;ve come up against something even bigger.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020131101e9b1004ms</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark140">ezra-klein</a><a name="bookmark141">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon ran the technical analysis of whether we have to shut down Kindles on planes</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Lydia DePillis 578 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">31 October 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon had a lot of happy news to report in its earnings release last Thursday -- enough revenue to keep investors happy, even though the company kept losing money. CEO Jeff Bezos was characteristically giddy, ticking off his achievements, including one in Washington D.C.: A Federal Aviation Administration-commissioned panel finally recommended that airline passengers be allowed to use portable electronic devices (i.e., Kindles) on the plane, opening the door to a reversal of a ban against those devices within months.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the release, Bezos included &quot;a big hat tip to Nick Bilton on that one.&quot; Nick Bilton is the New York Times technology writer who was upset when interrupted in his Kindle reading as a plane taxied for takeoff, and then got the Times to pay for an independent test of whether the rays put out by a Kindle could actually disrupt a plane&#39;s communications systems. The answer was no -- which, sure, might have helped embarrass the FAA into giving its abundance of caution a rest. Bilton certainly took a victory lap when the panel&#39;s recommendation came out.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But you know who Bezos probably should&#39;ve thanked? Paul Misener, Amazon&#39;s head of global public policy, who chaired the technical subcommittee on the panel that pushed for the change (its report still hasn&#39;t come out).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Misener has also lobbied the Federal Communications Commission, which has some jurisdiction over the issue, on &quot;issues related to accessibility&quot; for the past few years (the company would not confirm whether or not those issues related to the airplane question). Amazon even packed a plane full of Kindles, switched on, to make a point.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sure, it&#39;s true that plenty of other companies and organizations that supported and would benefit from consumers being able to use gadgets during taxiing and landing. But it&#39;s still eyebrow-raising that a company with the most commercial interest in the outcome of a panel&#39;s report would directly oversee the scientific content of that report, as opposed to, say, some independent technical expert, or even someone on the FAA&#39;s staff who might know about such things (like the President&#39;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, which is stocked with academics). Because if a company puts out research supporting its business interests, it&#39;s usually taken with a heaping spoonful of salt.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the FAA, though, it&#39;s standard operating procedure. The agency convenes panels frequently, and often relies on people who make the equipment to test things and issue recommendations -- which just creates the opportunity for manipulation, even if it&#39;s never exercised. So if you&#39;re a stickler for scientific ethics, just look the other way.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here&#39;s what the agency had to say:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The FAA sought public comment on expanded use of portable electronic devices on airplanes and announced publicly that the Agency was forming an advisory rulemaking committee. We selected participants based on experience and knowledge on the issue with the goal of having representation from stakeholders across the industry. The final report came from a group of experts that included representatives from the airlines, aviation manufacturers, passengers, pilots, flight attendants, and the mobile technology industry. The agency regularly works with government and industry experts to gather information to help the FAA make decisions on key technical issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

Hottovy. &quot;But it looks like the revenue momentum will continue into the fourth quarter.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon became the latest tech company to have outperformed in an otherwise dreary earnings season. About 84 percent of technology companies that have reported so far beat earnings estimates, and 63 percent have beat revenue projections.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s third-quarter revenue was $17.1 billion, up from $13.8 billion in the comparable period a year earlier. The average analyst estimate was $16.8 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is trying to evolve from an online retailer into a broader technology company offering consumer gadgets such as tablets and cloud-computing services to companies and governments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The evolution has entailed making investments in technology and content, such as videos and music, all while building distribution centers across the United States and expanding its presence in competitive overseas markets such as China.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is spending billions of dollars to expand, and that has taken a toll on earnings. But some investors think the move will pay off as the spending tapers and margins expand.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s gross profit margin - a closely watched measure of earnings that excludes several expenses - was 28.6 percent in the second quarter, one of the highest levels in more than a decade by analysts&#39; reckoning.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Third-quarter margins were about 28 percent, in line with what analysts had expected.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company&#39;s net loss was $41 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, narrowing from a net loss of $274 million, or</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$0.60 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s stock has gained about 30 percent this year and is valued at 131 times its projected 2014 earnings, among the highest valuations in the market. After rising 1.7 percent in Thursday&#39;s session, Amazon shares climbed more than 8 percent in after-hours trading, to about $360.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The takeaway is that the third-quarter sales show that the Amazon value proposition is striking a chord with consumers,&quot; Hottovy said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, that was quick. Just a day after Apple announced its newest full-sized tablet, the iPad Air, Amazon rolled out a new banner ad on its homepage proclaiming the Kindle Fire HDX is &quot;lighter than Air.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And it is true — both of the latest models of the Kindle Fire are lighter than their Apple competitors: The larger model of the Kindle Fire HDX weighs 0.82 pounds to the iPad Air&#39;s weight of 1 pound. And the smaller Fire is 0.66 pounds to the new iPad mini with retina display&#39;s 0.73 pounds.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But it&#39;s also worth noting that it&#39;s not a straight comparison.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For one, the screens on both Kindle Fire HDX models are smaller than on their corresponding iPads. The larger Kindle Fire HDX is 8.9 inches to the iPad Air&#39;s 9.7, which retains the screen size of the standard iPad. The smaller Kindle Fire is 7 inches to the iPad mini&#39;s 7.9 inches.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The construction of the two devices is also different. The iPads are made with aluminum bodies to preserve Apple&#39;s premium design philosophy, while the Kindle Fire HDX models show Amazon&#39;s low-price philosophy with plastic bodies. Amazon has improved the feel of its tablets with this latest model. But it&#39;s still pretty clear that its design has a different goal: to be made inexpensively to keep prices low.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, the quick turnaround on the ad — and the fact that it calls the iPad Air out by name — shows that it&#39;s going to be a particularly fierce holiday season in the tablet market, as Amazon and Apple duke it out with Microsoft, Nokia, and Google for a place in gift-wrapped boxes across the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the United States, as Bloomberg reported last month, Amazon had a 4.6 percent share of the market ahead of its HDX launch, as compared to Apple&#39;s 50.7 percent. But the online retailer has been pushing its tablet hard and improving core features such as browsing and typing as well as introducing a new 24/7 customer service feature. That&#39;s a calculated move to go after first-time tablet owners and for those looking for something cheap that serves their basic needs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">(Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) </a><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" target="_blank">Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020131023e9an005el</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark148">the-switch</a><a name="bookmark149">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Switchboard: The NSA snooped on Mexican president&#39;s email ; New NSA leak information, Walmart’s play to compete online, and the other stories you missed this weekend.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Andrea Peterson 481 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">21 October 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

The German magazine Der Spiegel reports that documents leaked by former national security contractor Edward Snowden show that the U.S. government successfully infiltrated the email of Mexican President Felipe Calderon. According to the report, the NSA&#39;s offensive hacking unit, Tactical Access Operations, &quot;successfully exploited a key mail server in the Mexican Presidencia domain within the Mexican Presidential network to gain first-ever access to President Felipe Calderon&#39;s public email account.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To catch up, Walmart moves to Amazon turf. Claire Cain Miller and Stephanie Clifford at the New York Times report that Walmart is laying the groundwork to compete with Amazon online. &quot;The country&#39;s largest retailer, which for years didn&#39;t blink at would-be competitors, is now under such a threat from Amazon that it is frantically playing catch-up by learning the technology business, including starting @WalmartLabs, its dot-com headquarters.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How stores use your phone&#39;s WiFi to track your shopping habits Our own Brian Fung explains how store can track your real-life behavior: &quot;Every smartphone these days comes equipped with a WiFi card. When the card is on and looking for networks to join, it&#39;s detectable by local routers. In your home, the router connects to your device, and then voila — you have the Internet on your phone. But in a retail environment, other in-store equipment can pick up your WiFi card, learn your device&#39;s unique ID number and use it to keep tabs on that device over time as you move through the store.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why Apple&#39;s claim that it can&#39;t intercept iMessages is largely semantics. In a post for The Switch, security researcher Ashkan Soltani explains why Apple&#39;s position on iMessage security isn&#39;t that comforting: &quot;So, is iMessage interception possible? Yes, of course. When you control the entire stack, anything is possible. Saying &quot;we can&#39;t do this&quot; is a bit disingenuous since what Apple really means is &quot;the current system doesn&#39;t have the &#39;spy on user X&#39; button. But it could add this with a few lines of code, and most users probably wouldn&#39;t know.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NSA delayed anti-leak software at base where Snowden worked. Reuters, citing unidentified current and former</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. officials, reports that &quot;before Snowden joined Booz Allen Hamilton last spring and was assigned to the NSA site as a systems administrator, other U.S. government facilities had begun to install software designed to spot attempts by unauthorized people to access or download data.&quot; However, the report says, the NSA facility in Hawaii where Snowden was assigned to work delayed implementing the system due to &quot;insufficient bandwidth.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020131021e9al002mi</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark150">-business-technology</a><a name="bookmark151">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">PayPal shows strength, but competitors loom; Amazon’s payment service</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 671 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">17 October 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Times are good for online payments, with PayPal reporting a 12 percent jump in revenue in the last quarter, even as parent company eBay reported a lower-than-expected future outlook, including the holiday season.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On an earnings call, eBay chief executive John Donahoe said that PayPal users were up 17 percent in the past quarter and that the service now weighs in at 137 million users. And 32 percent of those users are coming in through mobile devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Things are good for PayPal right now, but eBay is far from the only one trying to work out the future of mobile payments, and it&#39;s facing competition from just about every side. The business of controlling online identity -- particularly in the payment world -- is becoming an increasingly attractive one to tech titans and payment processors alike.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Managing passwords is one of the biggest hassles for consumers in the digital age, particularly when it involves remembering dozens of credentials for different accounts. Solving that problem securely is big business, and one reason why companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are happy to let folks use sign-in credentials for their networks on other sites. And when companies can hook payment processing into that equation, it makes their networks even stronger -- hence one reason why PayPal continues to work on becoming a payment option across the Web.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But new competitors pop up every day. Most recently, Amazon stepped into the ring, announcing a new program, &quot;Login and Pay,&quot; that allows users to do just that by using their Amazon accounts to let the tech titan process and authorize payments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Given the size of Amazon and the trust they&#39;ve built up as a brand over all these years, for social login over all, this is a positive for all involved,&quot; said Bill Piwonka, vice president of marketing for the social log-in firm Janrain. Janrain works with several companies, including Amazon, to deploy social login services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Based on its reputation, Piwonka said that he thinks Amazon will see long-term success in the space as it signs up more stores to use its service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patrick Salyer, the chief executive of the social login company Gigya , said that while other firms such as Google have already launched their own payment services tied to social log-in, Amazon&#39;s program poses the biggest competition for PayPal, because the company has a wide reach and an established past as a retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Scale, he said, is the firm&#39;s greatest advantage. &quot;Over 200 million consumers that use product on a regular basis,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Salyer, whose firm works with companies including ABC and Barnes and Noble, also said that he expects the worlds of identity authentication and payment processing to move closer together in the future, particularly as more payments are processed on mobile devices, which have smaller screens and make the annoying process of logging in even more frustrating.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He also said that he expects that companies providing social login services will find their services deployed in brick-and-mortar stores down the line, because the process can be fairly seamless.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mobile apps that have your payment information stored in them — such as Amazon&#39;s, he said — let you make purchases with a single tap. &quot;The ability to take that to other apps will be very, very appealing to retailers,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Piwonka did note, however, that if consumers aren&#39;t comfortable with letting login providers have information about the other Web sites they visit, that most services still offer the option to create accounts with separate usernames and passwords.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If you are concerned that doohickey.com or brand.com is going to misuse your data, if you have that concern, then you don&#39;t have to use your Amazon, Facebook or Google account,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s a different usage model than social login.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">(Amazon chief executive Jeffrey Bezos owns The Washington Post.) </a><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" target="_blank">Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020131017e9ah003ux</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 2 end/Image_023.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark152">-business-technology</a><a name="bookmark153">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Review: Kindle Fire HDX; Amazon’s tablet is an improvement over previous models, but still best for true Amazon fans.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 1,066 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">15 October 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You might be thinking about picking up your pumpkins right now, but companies are already gearing up some fierce competition for your holiday gift dollars. With the new Kindle Fire HDX, Amazon is refreshing its play in the tablet world, with an eye toward smaller, reading-focused tablets such as the iPad mini and Nexus 7.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon loaned The Washington Post a review unit of its most basic model: a 7-inch, 16 GB Kindle Fire with WiFi connectivity. Here&#39;s how it stacks up:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hardware: Physically, the Kindle Fire HDX is a major improvement over previous models. Amazon apparently took heed of earlier feedback about hardware, cutting a good deal of bulk from the tablet and making such changes as moving the volume and power buttons to more logical spots on the device. The Fire HDX also has angled edges that make it easier to hold the tablet with one hand or two hands.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Internally, the tablet has a faster processor that mostly eliminates the lag that affected older models, though I found its keyboard is still not as responsive as its competitors&#39;. It&#39;s still not a tablet I would choose for work — though Amazon is marketing the Fire HDX and its security features to businesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The screen is bright and crisp for video, and users get a 30-day free trial of Amazon&#39;s Prime Service, which includes access to Prime Instant Video. The Fire is slightly easier to read in bright light (there&#39;s been little direct sunlight to test in D.C. lately) than other tablets, such as the iPad mini. Those who want a dedicated reading device are still best off with an e-ink reader.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Software: Amazon has made some revamps to the tablet&#39;s appearance (it looks a little more Apple, with the shape of its icons). But ,looks aside, the navigation here is designed to make it smoother to get from your most recent apps, to all your apps — and back. The effect, overall, is that it is easier to get from place to place on the tablet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The firm&#39;s Silk browser has also been improved, though it&#39;s still not as smooth as Apple&#39;s Safari or Google&#39;s Chrome. But the redesign makes it easier to juggle multiple sites and move more quickly to most-used sites.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There&#39;s also a new interface for Amazon shopping on the tablet, allowing consumers to save items they&#39;re interested in buying without having to put them straight into their cars. Make no mistake, this tablet is designed to help Amazon sell its own goods.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Where the Fire continues to falls down, however, is in its app selection. Because Amazon uses its own version of Android, only a limited number of programs run on the Kindle. That&#39;s fine if you&#39;re using the tablet mostly to read, shop and watch video on Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime. But if you want to use the tablet for much more, you won&#39;t have nearly as many choices as you would on other tablets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Usability: There&#39;s clearly been a lot of attention paid to making the Fire more intuitive. But if you still haven&#39;t quite caught on, you can get help with in-device access to a customer service line by swiping down from the top of the screen and hitting the &quot;Mayday&quot; button. That will call up a customer service representative, live, on the screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The battery life projection from Amazon puts the tablet at over 11 hours of mixed use, with 17 hours of just reading. In the course of testing, the battery came in a under that — about nine hours of battery life with mixed use, while putting the tablet through its paces.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other: The Fire HDX also hooks into the Amazon ecosystem. Users can link the books they read on the Kindle with other Amazon properties such as Goodreads or Audible. And, Amazon promises, Kindle Fire HDX owners will soon be able to shoot the video they&#39;re watching on their tablets to their televisions, via partnerships with set-top box and console makers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In terms of gripes, the smaller version of the tablet doesn&#39;t have a rear-facing camera — though the larger version does — which means that video conferencing isn&#39;t super-easy. The front-facing camera works fine for basic video and photos, but this is hardly going to become your primary shooter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the newest Fire has at least one real plus that&#39;s not even part of the tablet — the Origami cover. Sold separately for $50 and up, the magnetic cover folds so that a user can pop a Kindle on it and rotate the Kindle in any direction without having to rearrange the fold. The cover also wakes up the tablet when it&#39;s opened and pulled back and puts it to sleep when it&#39;s placed back down over the screen. It would have been good to have the cover included with the tablet, of course, but it&#39;s a nice addition if you have the $50 to spare.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bottom line: The newest Kindle Fire HDX is Amazon&#39;s strongest tablet to date, but is still best suited to Amazon&#39;s most loyal customers — or those who want to become loyal Amazon customers. The tablet still doesn&#39;t have the breadth of apps to compete with Apple, Google or Samsung offerings. If that doesn&#39;t bother you, the price is a plus for the quality of hardware you get.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The base, 16 GB, WiFi tablet starts at $229. It also comes in 32 GB and 64 GB versions, and users have the option of adding LTE service with either AT&amp;T or Verizon. Users can also choose to add $15 to the price of any of the tablets to opt out of Amazon&#39;s &quot;special offers&quot; program, which displays certain discounts and ads on the device&#39;s screen savers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has given the tablet an Oct. 18 release date. According to Amazon&#39;s Web site, however, orders placed now are expected to ship the week of Oct. 28.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">(Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) </a><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" target="_blank">Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020131014e9ae0043f</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 2 end/Image_024.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark154">Marc A.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Obamacare is imploding. But thanks to the government shutdown, everyone is talking about the implosion of the GOP instead.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The shutdown drama has distracted from the fact that Obamacare&#39;s debut is worse than many realize — and it threatens the fundamental viability of the law itself. The administration claims the Obamacare online exchanges crashed because the Web site got more than 8 million hits in the first week. Please. You know how many people visit Amazon.com every week? More than 70 million. The difference is: 1.) Amazon seldom crashes, and 2.) on Amazon, people actually buy something.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It appears virtually no one is buying Obamacare. While administration officials brag about how many visitors the site is getting, they refuse to divulge how many people actually signed up. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was asked that directly by Jon Stewart on &quot;The Daily Show.&quot; &quot;Fully enrolled?&quot; Sebelius stuttered. &quot;I can&#39;t tell you. Because I don&#39;t know.&quot; That is a frightening admission of incompetence. If the Obama administration can&#39;t even track how many people signed up, how on earth is it going to verify whether those people are eligible for subsidies? How will it protect against fraud?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Post reported this past weekend that the failure of the Web site is worse than previously known: &quot;Even when consumers have been able to sign up, insurers sometimes can&#39;t tell who their new customers are because of a separate set of computer defects.&quot; It turns out that in some 99 percent of applications, the Obamacare site did not provide insurers with enough verifiable information to enroll people in their plans.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Computer experts say the problems with the site are not because of heavy traffic but are the result of structural flaws in system architecture. It is going to take months to rebuild it. That raises a question: If the federal government can&#39;t manage a simple Web site, how on earth is it going to manage the health care of millions of Americans?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It also means that President Obama may have no choice but to delay the individual mandate. As my American Enterprise Institute colleague, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, points out, how can Obama penalize people for not having health insurance if the government&#39;s Web site to provide that insurance doesn&#39;t work?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Without the individual mandate, Obamacare unravels. The only way the law works is if the government forces young, healthy people into it by threatening them with penalties for not carrying health insurance. But if there is no penalty for not signing up, then fewer Americans will sign up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even if the administration manages to fix the Web site and finally implement the individual mandate, people still may not join — because the plans being offered are so unattractive. To entice people to join the exchanges, the administration forced insurers to offer low monthly premiums and cover people with preexisting conditions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Insurers have responded by increasing deductibles — the out-of-pocket costs people must pay before insurance benefits kick in — to stratospheric levels.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to an analysis this weekend by the president&#39;s hometown paper, the Chicago Tribune, &quot;21 of the 22 lowest-priced plans offered on the Illinois health insurance exchange for Cook County have annual deductibles of more than $4,000 for an individual and $8,000 for family coverage. Plans with the least expensive monthly</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">premiums — highlighted by state and federal officials as proof the new law will keep costs low for consumers — have deductibles as high as $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for families.&quot; Even with federal subsidies, few Americans will bother to buy insurance with a $4,000 to $12,700 deductible — and millions won&#39;t even be eligible for the subsidies.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If enough Americans don&#39;t join the exchanges, Obamacare collapses. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the administration needs at least 7 million people to join the exchanges for Obamacare to be financially viable. While the administration won&#39;t reveal sign-up rates, London&#39;s Daily Mail reported that total sign-ups in the first week were just 51,000 people. If accurate, that would mean they have just 6,949,000 more to go to break even.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bottom line: It turns out Obamacare is blowing itself up just fine without Republican help. Far from a few &quot;glitches,&quot; the president&#39;s signature program is in free fall after only a week. But instead of focusing on the Obamacare debacle, the news is filled with stories about . . . the government shutdown. The irony is, the shutdown was intended to stop Obamacare. Instead, it is rescuing Obama from his own incompetence.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020131014e9ae003pj</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 2 end/Image_025.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark156">CapitalBusiness</a><a name="bookmark157">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services prevails in court as tussle over CIA contract continues</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Marjorie Censer 547 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14 October 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL A11</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

(Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post and Capital Business.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IBM protested the award to the Government Accountability Office, which found merit in the complaint and recommended the CIA reopen the competition. Amazon Web Services then took the battle to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Judge Thomas C. Wheeler granted Amazon&#39;s motion and restored the original contract in a ruling last week. The CIA &quot;and AWS may immediately resume performance of the [commercial cloud services] contract,&quot; the judge wrote.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon said in a statement that it looks &quot;forward to resuming our work on this important contract,&quot; but IBM said in its own statement that it plans to appeal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This court decision seems especially inappropriate in light of the current times, since IBM&#39;s bid was superior in many ways, including being substantially more cost-effective,&quot; the company added.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The CIA said in a statement that it&#39;s &quot;pleased that it can now move forward with procuring critical cloud services for the intelligence community.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Arlington-based CACI International said last week that it has agreed to buy McLean-based Six3 Systems from private equity firm GTCR for $820 million to boost its cyber and intelligence work.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Six3 employs about 1,600 and its revenue for the year is expected to be about $470 million, CACI said. The acquisition is the largest in CACI&#39;s history of 57 deals, said Ken Asbury, the company&#39;s chief executive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re taking the long-term view of where the market&#39;s going to go,&quot; Asbury said in an interview last week. &quot;We think that the market&#39;s shifting to capable companies that are affordable.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said Six3 will become a business group within CACI and retain its name and its leadership team. &quot;We sort of don&#39;t want to mess with their success,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Astrophysics, which supplies X-ray inspection systems, said last week it has opened an office in Crystal City to better reach its government customers. The company&#39;s headquarters is in the City of Industry, Calif.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The office is to be led by Mark Laustra, who previously led government sales at Smiths Detection, the company said in its announcement.

The company had earned a &quot;very good&quot; rating while FRS earned &quot;neutral,&quot; but SoBran priced its proposal at $5.7 million, higher than the FRS price of just under $5.3 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The GAO noted that the &quot;contracting officer then determined that the protester&#39;s superior performance was not worth the $425,000 price differential&quot; and backed the agency.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20131014solesource1014</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020131014e9ae0004b</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark158">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark159">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">MongoDB raises $150M in financing Microsoft cuts prices in fight with Amazon</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">255 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14 October 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL A14</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos formally took over as the owner of The Washington Post on Tuesday, officially ending 80 years of local control of the newspaper by the Graham family.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bezos&#39;s $250 million purchase was completed as expected with the signing of sale documents. The signing transfers the newspaper and other assets from The Washington Post Co. to Nash Holdings, Bezos&#39;s private investment company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos, who founded the online shopping company in 1994 and became a billionaire in the process, has vowed to continue the newspaper&#39;s long history of independent journalism. His technical and marketing savvy, long-term outlook and lack of an apparent ideological agenda made him an attractive steward for the paper, Post Co. chief executive Donald E. Graham said in August, when an agreement in principle was first disclosed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the same time, Bezos, 49, has the deep pockets to sustain an enterprise that has been buffeted for years by declining readership and advertising, especially in the printed Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Post&#39;s new owner hasn&#39;t disclosed specific plans or changes he intends to make for the money-losing paper. But in earlier interviews and on a two-day visit to The Post&#39;s downtown Washington headquarters in early September, he suggested that he&#39;ll provide a financial cushion — or &quot;runway&quot; — that will allow The Post time to conduct experiments that could lead to a successful business model.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post Co. will continue to operate as a separate company without The Post newspaper. It is the parent company for a variety of businesses, including cable-TV systems, TV stations and the Kaplan education company. It will change its name to reflect the newspaper&#39;s sale, but a new name hasn&#39;t been announced yet. Graham will continue as chief executive of the renamed company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although Bezos will head the new organization, the rest of the paper&#39;s management won&#39;t change. Publisher Katharine Weymouth will continue in that job, as will executive editor Martin Baron.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos himself will remain chief executive of Amazon, based in Seattle. He has said he will visit the paper periodically but will devote most of his attention to his &quot;day job&quot; running Amazon, which had revenue of $61 billion last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Weymouth, who is Graham&#39;s niece, will be The Post&#39;s sole remaining connection to the family that has guided and shaped the newspaper for four generations. She is the great-granddaughter of Eugene Meyer, the financier who bought the paper at a bankruptcy auction in 1933 and built it with the help of his son-in-law, Philip L. Graham, and later Graham&#39;s widow and Meyer&#39;s daughter, Katharine Graham. Donald, the son of Philip and Katharine, became publisher of the newspaper and eventually succeeded his mother as chief executive of the parent company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to The Post nameplate and its Springfield, Va., printing plant, Bezos is acquiring the Spanish-language El Tiempo newspaper, the free-distribution Express daily newspaper, the suburban Washington Gazette weeklies and 23 acres of undeveloped land in Charles County, Md.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a note to employees on Tuesday, Katharine Weymouth said, &quot;We are officially under new ownership, and a new era for The Washington Post begins.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She thanked her uncle for helping the newspaper remain &quot;a standard-bearer for world-class news reporting and analysis,&quot; adding, &quot;with Jeff&#39;s leadership, we will build on that foundation and take The Post to new heights.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post Co.&#39;s stock closed at $628.54 per share, up $17.19, or 2.8 percent, in Tuesday&#39;s trading. The close was a five-year high for the stock, which has been rising steadily this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:paul.farhi@washpost.com">paul.farhi@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020131001e9a1006vc</p></body></html>
