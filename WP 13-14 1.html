All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Transparent,&quot; a new 10-episode dramedy that begins streaming Friday on Amazon Prime, is a precise and comically downbeat little portrait of a family - the Pfeffermans - in which self-fulfillment overtook intimacy. The ennui is linked to entitlement; in this family, everyone was too busy grabbing for what he or she wanted.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Everyone, that is, except for the paterfamilias, Mort Pfefferman (&quot;Arrested Development&#39;s&quot; Jeffrey Tambor), a retired college professor. Late in life and long after a divorce from Shelly (Judith Light), the mother of his three adult children, Mort has decided to end his private anguish and live openly as his truest self, taking his first steps to coming out as a woman named Maura.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Encouraged by her transgender support group in West Hollywood, Maura feels ready to tell her children. But when they arrive at her home - summoned to a dinner of takeout barbecue at the house in which they all grew up</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">- Maura instead greets them once more as the father they knew. She&#39;s afraid of telling them, but also she can&#39;t get a word in edgewise. Instead, Mort tells them he&#39;s going to sell the house, setting off an argument about who gets what.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;re so selfish,&quot; Maura says, describing her children to her support group. &quot;I don&#39;t see how it is that I raised three people who cannot see beyond themselves.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That seems to be the show&#39;s core message: Each of the Pfeffermans, Maura included, suffer the loneliness that comes with self-absorption. As TV characters, they will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has spent enough time attending low-budget indie films or watching premium cable shows that are all about vaguely unhappy people who, more often than not, live in sun-soaked Los Angeles, where all the vaguely depressed television writers and producers live, too. &quot;Transparent&quot; can at times feel like a skewed home movie intended for comfortably upper-middle class, nominally Jewish families from West L.A.; indeed, the show&#39;s intro is a collage of images culled from old home movies and videotapes of weddings, bar mitzvahs and drag shows.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Transparent&quot; creator Jill Soloway (whose past work includes time at &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;The United States of Tara&quot;) has sculpted Maura&#39;s brood from the same narcissistic clay that brought audiences such memorably complicated characters as Amy Jellicoe from HBO&#39;s short-lived &quot;Enlightened&quot; or the array of Catherine Keener characters in the films of Nicole Holofcener. If you fondly recognize any of those references, then it&#39;s a good bet that &quot;Transparent&quot; just became your favorite new series of the fall season.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Maura&#39;s oldest, Sarah (Amy Landecker), is a straight, stay-at-home mom with a full-time housekeeper and an obsession with the lesbian lover (Melora Hardin) from her college days, who has recently come back into Sarah&#39;s life and upended her marriage. Maura&#39;s son, Josh (Jay Duplass), is a successful record-label producer with a fairly typical assortment of hipster hang-ups, sexual and otherwise. The youngest child is Ali (Gaby Hoffmann), who is unemployed and spends a fair amount of time on drugs and not following through on ideas for books she intends to write, living off occasional checks from her father.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What should really be a show about Maura&#39;s journey instead presents her as the more stable, normal and approximately most noble character here - though Maura is not without flaws. Tambor gives a striking performance that perfectly captures both the forlorn and optimistic moments in Maura&#39;s life, making great use of both his comic chops and his Droopy Dog face. Landecker, Duplass and Hoffmann are equally captivating as a trio of slightly despicable yet entirely relatable siblings, honing each character&#39;s attendant hurts and shortcomings into a broader story of shared dysfunction.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Although each episode clocks in around 30 minutes, &quot;Transparent&quot; has an almost &quot;Nurse Jackie&quot;-like ability to make such good use of that half-hour that you almost feel as if you&#39;ve watched an hourlong episode. The writing is subtle and economical yet full. It&#39;s one of those rare shows that you could binge through in a matter of hours (Amazon is making all the episodes available at once), but it might work better if you space them out over several days. (Since the customer is always right in television consumption these days, that&#39;s up to you. And speaking of customers, here&#39;s your usual disclosure that Amazon and The Washington Post share an owner.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Despite the fact that it&#39;s tracking the stories of four separate Pfeffermans, &quot;Transparent&quot; still manages to find time to flash back 20-plus years, where viewers get some idea of how long Mort has desired to be Maura. &quot;The West Wing&#39;s&quot; Bradley Whitford makes a cameo appearance (&quot;Transparent&quot; is loaded with actors you&#39;ll fleetingly recognize) as Marcy, Maura&#39;s first gender-questioning confidante.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Transparent&quot; is also particularly good at seamlessly imparting some &quot;Trans 101&quot; to viewers who will come at the story from different levels of enlightenment and preconceptions. Without the sort of sermonizing that came with other films and TV shows about transgender women and men, the scripts and storylines artfully acquaint a viewer with the basic manners of gender identity.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But rather than turn &quot;Transparent&quot; into a statement about the transgender experience, Soloway and her co-writers treat Maura&#39;s journey mainly as one of many compelling story arcs, and they aren&#39;t afraid to let it be as odd or awkward as it wants to be. In her tentative new life, perhaps only Maura stands the chance of finding a happiness that her children, in their blindness, may never know.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Transparent (10 episodes) begins streaming Friday on Amazon Prime Instant Video.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos popped up in Washington on Wednesday to announce his latest business venture: His low-profile space company, Blue Origin, will supply engines for the rockets that launch America&#39;s military and national security satellites.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The announcement, at the National Press Club, featured Bezos, who last year bought The Washington Post, and Tory Bruno, the chief executive of United Launch Alliance, which has a virtual monopoly on the nation&#39;s most sensitive rocket launches.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Also on hand: A two-foot-tall model of a rocket engine, the BE-4. The full-size version is about 12 feet tall, Bezos said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I think it&#39;s pretty clear that it&#39;s time for a 21st-century engine booster system,&quot; Bezos said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">This is a historic partnership between &quot;Old Space&quot; and &quot;New Space.&quot; United Launch Alliance (ULA) is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Blue Origin is a start-up fueled by Bezos money. Now ULA will invest in the development of the BE-4 engine.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Neither executive would discuss a dollar figure, although it&#39;s probably somewhat less than $1 billion. Bruno said a typical liquid-fueled rocket engine takes seven years and $1 billion to develop, but Blue Origin is already several years along on the BE-4. Bruno said the engine could be ready within four years to serve as the main engine on the company&#39;s Atlas V rockets.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The agreement instantly propels the publicity-shy Blue Origin into the mainstream of the aerospace industry. The company rarely issues a news release and has long preferred to let other New Space companies, most notably Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX, garner headlines. That circumspection — the way Blue Origin developed its new engine &quot;without hype, without fanfare&quot; — is one reason ULA was attracted to Blue Origin, Bruno said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The deal also solves a major problem for ULA. The company&#39;s Atlas V rocket uses as its main engine the Russian-made RD-180, a powerful booster developed in the Soviet era and now the workhorse of America&#39;s fleet of big rockets. The disintegration of relations between the United States and Russia in recent months has called attention to ULA&#39;s reliance on the Russian hardware.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">At one point this summer, a top Russian official suggested that the supply of engines would be cut off. That threat appears to have been mere bluster, and ULA recently obtained two RD-180s, with more on the way. But Congress and the military are eager to see ULA develop alternatives to the RD-180.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;I think the U.S. needs to have an American-made booster engine. And, finally, I think, for humanity, we need access to space,&quot; Bezos said in an interview after the news conference. &quot;This will move all of those things forward. And I feel great about it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Asked about his overarching goal, he said, &quot;What we want to have happen is millions of people living and working in space.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The partnership would not preclude ULA&#39;s using other rocket engines. But Bezos said, &quot;Our goal is to make the engine so operable, so low-cost and so reliable, that ULA would be crazy to use anything else.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The deal delicately inserts Blue Origin into NASA&#39;s plans to launch American astronauts once again from American soil. Since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011, NASA astronauts have had to ride on Russian rockets at a cost of $71 million a seat. On Tuesday, NASA announced that it had awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, totaling $6.8 billion, to carry astronauts to the International Space Station as early as 2017 under the new &quot;commercial crew&quot; program.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Boeing&#39;s space capsule will launch on the Atlas V. That means that, at some point, American astronauts could be blasted into space using rockets equipped with Blue Origin engines.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Tuesday&#39;s announcement that SpaceX would be one of the two companies delivering astronauts to orbit represented a triumphal moment for the New Space movement led by Musk, who in barely a decade has turned SpaceX into a major player in aerospace.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But Musk had to share the spotlight Tuesday with Bezos after the Wall Street Journal reported on the surprising Blue Origin-ULA deal and the companies revealed that Bezos would join Bruno on Wednesday at the National Press Club news conference.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Bezos made his fortune turning Amazon.com from a start-up bookseller into an all-purpose retailer and Internet hosting service. But he has been fascinated by space travel since childhood and has reportedly poured half a billion dollars into Blue Origin, which is located outside Seattle in Kent, Wash.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Until now, Blue Origin had touted its plans to create suborbital and eventually orbital spaceships that could carry people into space, but the company had little to show for its efforts. At a conference last year in New Mexico, Blue Origin executive Bretton Alexander showed a video of an engine test — the BE-3, a precursor to the engine ULA is investing in — and said the company&#39;s philosophy is &quot;low cost, reusability and safety.&quot; He said Blue Origin&#39;s goal is &quot;more people flying in space to do more things.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That seemed years away, though. The Blue Origin suborbital spacecraft, New Shepard, has never been launched into space. Bezos said Wednesday that crewed flights of that vehicle could take place toward the end of this decade.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The BE-4 engine could be used for orbital spacecraft, Bezos said. The ULA deal obviously gives Blue Origin a boost when discussing those kinds of ambitious plans, which previously had incited derision from Musk. Last year, during a dispute between Blue Origin and SpaceX over access to a space shuttle launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center, Musk took a shot at Blue Origin&#39;s achievements so far.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;If they do somehow show up in the next 5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA&#39;s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what Pad 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,&quot; Musk wrote in an e-mail published at SpaceNews.com. &quot;Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In an interview later in the fall with The Washington Post, Musk said of Bezos: &quot;He doesn&#39;t want people to think he&#39;s getting distracted from Amazon. Every time I talk to Jeff, I tell him to spend more time on Blue Origin. . . .</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Advancing spaceflight is more important.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">When a reporter asked Bezos on Wednesday how he manages his time, given his disparate interests, he said: &quot;Amazon is my day job. I love Amazon.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">He went on: &quot;I&#39;m very, very lucky. I get to live and work in the future. And so that is fantastic.&quot; He said he doesn&#39;t have any hobbies such as golf. But he does have the space bug.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;You don&#39;t choose your passions; your passions choose you,&quot; Bezos said. &quot;For me, space is something that I have been in love with since I was 5 years old. I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the surface of the moon, and I guess it imprinted me.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:joel.achenbach@washpost.com">joel.achenbach@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140917ea9h0073r</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4">Hank Stuever Style</a><a name="bookmark5">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">‘Transparent’ review: A father who’s now a mother comes out to her selfish brood; In Amazon’s superb</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">online dramedy, Jeffrey Tambor stars as a woman who’s ready to get on with her life.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">323 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">19 September 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

And 9 other questions about the world’s biggest IPO</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Drew Harwell 2,336 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">19 September 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In the late 1990s, a 34-year-old Chinese schoolteacher named Jack Ma, working from his cramped apartment, unveiled a small, colorful, chaotic Web service he named after an old folk tale.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Fifteen years later, that company, Alibaba, has become the world&#39;s largest online retailer — and the biggest company you may have never heard of. Its marketplaces were home to $248 billion in sales last year, more than Amazon.com and eBay combined.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Led by Ma, now China&#39;s richest billionaire, Alibaba will take its biggest step yet toward global retail domination this week when it begins selling shares to the public for the first time in what&#39;s called an initial public offering, or IPO. The company is predicted to raise more than $24 billion, the biggest stock-market debut in history.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But you can be forgiven if you&#39;ve never heard of Alibaba. Though a household name in China, one of the world&#39;s largest e-commerce markets, Alibaba has remained a relative unknown in the United States. Here are 10 quick things to know about how Alibaba took over the Web.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. So: Alibaba?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is a massive, elaborate, wildly profitable company that dominates online buying and selling in China: Eighty percent of the stuff sold online there goes through an Alibaba site. Like eBay and other online marketplaces, Alibaba doesn&#39;t own the stuff that it sells on its Web site: It takes a cut from sellers who use it and charges a little extra to advertise. Outside of its main markets, the company has tentacles in a lot of different business lines, including payment services and cloud computing.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It started in 1999 as a way to connect Chinese factories and suppliers with global retailers, and in the years since it has rode skyward atop China&#39;s rapidly expanding middle class. Their increased spending and Internet use have created one of the world&#39;s biggest Web-business goldmines, and investors are hungry to jump on IPOs, like Alibaba&#39;s, that have run so parallel to China&#39;s rise. When Alibaba was founded, 9 million people in China used the Internet. Last year, that number had climbed past 600 million, or nearly twice the U.S. population.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Though Alibaba&#39;s main marketplaces look a lot like America&#39;s online auction houses, the group has developed a quintessentially Chinese sensibility, said Gil Luria, a managing director covering financial technology stocks at Wedbush Securities. They look less like storefronts — with their fixed prices and stable supplies — than thriving, bustling bazaars.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;The reason [Alibaba&#39;s top marketplace] Taobao won China is they were particularly able to customize the experience to the Chinese consumer: the look and feel, the friendliness, the attitude of the Web site, the ability to chat between buyer and seller for negotiation,&quot; Luria said. &quot;Those are things that are distinct between the Chinese marketplace and the American marketplace.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">An IPO allows a private company to &quot;go public,&quot; by selling shares to public investors on the stock market. IPOs provide companies and shareholders two huge benefits: They give investors a way to grab a potentially lucrative piece of a fast-growing start-up, and they let the business raise, in this case, a staggering amount of money while also boosting their global reputation.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">IPOs are highly watched because the companies&#39; values are largely set by how willing investors are to pay for their shares. You may remember the hubbub over Facebook&#39;s IPO, in 2012, when it made its $16 billion market debut.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Alibaba, which plans to sell each of its 320 million shares for between $66 and $68, is expected to set its initial stock price Thursday and start trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BABA.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The high price is a show of confidence in Alibaba&#39;s future growth, and investors seem more than willing to pay up. During Alibaba&#39;s international &quot;roadshows&quot; — the name companies give to their traveling IPO pep rallies — lines of eager investors have stretched out the door.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">At the midpoint of its share price, Alibaba would be valued at about $165 billion, larger than Amazon.com. (Note: Amazon.com&#39;s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) But Alibaba&#39;s huge starting price does have one drawback: It would need to keep growing like crazy to deliver even moderate returns.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">One example: Amazon, which went public at a $438 million valuation, is now valued at around $160 billion, meaning early investors have made about 365 times what they first spent. For Alibaba investors to see similar returns, its valuation would need to grow into the trillions.</p><ol id="l1"><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">How big is Alibaba?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Very big. According to company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Chinese buyers made about 11 billion orders on Alibaba marketplaces last year, trading $248 billion in goods and services.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">As a low-cost portal for other people&#39;s merchandise, it&#39;s hyper-profitable, with its $7.95 billion in revenue last year netting Alibaba a 45 percent profit margin. (Over the same time, eBay&#39;s was about 18 percent.) At the same time, Alibaba&#39;s satellite companies have seen their own huge success. Its PayPal-like service, Alipay, has been used to move $519 billion in payments, more than double PayPal&#39;s $180 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Alibaba counts about 280 million individual shoppers and small businesses as active buyers, a user base that has doubled in the last two years, SEC filings show. And those buyers are becoming more and more reliant on Alibaba&#39;s offerings: The average active buyer made 49 orders last year, up from 33 in 2011.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m in the United States. Why should I care?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Alibaba&#39;s native access to China&#39;s low-cost producers could bring some major competition to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">American storefronts, potentially tamping down prices or helping change where buyers shop, analysts said. Alibaba also wants to appeal to Americans directly through a U.S.-aimed marketplace, 11 Main, now open by invitation only.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Many small American businesses already use Alibaba to solicit bids from low-cost manufacturers and suppliers. Its stated mission is &quot;to make it easy to do business anywhere,&quot; and Alibaba&#39;s huge IPO bump in funding and reputation could lead even more businesses to seek it out.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Analysts said Alibaba seems most interested in growing its base in China. But the group does not seem content to just stay the world&#39;s largest online retailer. It&#39;s investing in mobile browsers, film production and social media, and the IPO will give it billions more dollars to extend its reach — in China and, possibly, the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;In the past decade, we measured ourselves by how much we changed China,&quot; Ma wrote in a letter to potential investors. &quot;In the future, we will be judged by how much progress we bring to the world.&quot;</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Where&#39;s Jack Ma now?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The former school teacher who founded Alibaba in his apartment is, at age 50, now China&#39;s richest person, with a net worth of $21.9 billion. He&#39;ll remain the face of Alibaba after the company&#39;s IPO. Alibaba&#39;s corporate structure gives Ma and his top partners a strong lock on the company&#39;s control.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Much has beenwritten about the charismatic founder once called &quot;Crazy Jack,&quot; so we&#39;ll just include this one example. To celebrate Alibaba&#39;s 10th anniversary, Ma dressed in leather, black lipstick, a nose ring and a towering mohawk to sing Elton John&#39;s &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot; to a Chinese stadium filled with 16,000 employees. (He sings a lot.)</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">What&#39;s with the name?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Ma said the name comes from &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,&quot; the Arabic folk tale best known for a magical phrase, &quot;Open sesame,&quot; used to unlock a door to hidden treasures. As Ma told an interviewer, Alibaba &quot;opens sesame for small- to medium-sized companies.&quot; It&#39;s also easy to spell. (In China, the company is called 阿里巴巴, pronounced A li ba ba.) The name of Alibaba&#39;s top marketplace, Taobao, means in Chinese, &quot;to find treasure.&quot;</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Why is a Chinese company having an initial public offering in the United States?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Lots of Chinese companies choose to go public by listing their stock in Hong Kong, China&#39;s massive financial hub. But the region rebuffed Alibaba&#39;s listing because of the company&#39;s unusual leadership structure, in which a small crew of company insiders controls the board of directors, and its direction, more than ordinary shareholders ever could.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">America&#39;s big stock exchanges don&#39;t bristle at those kinds of systems — Facebook, Google and other</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">U.S. companies also use &quot;dual-class&quot; share structures — so Alibaba brought its listing to New York. That was huge news for the exchange, which collects fees from listed companies and will likely see a boost in trading revenues.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">What else does Alibaba do?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s break it down. It runs Taobao, China&#39;s largest online bazaar, and Tmall, a more polished marketplace catering to bigger brands. Then there are wholesale marketplaces, such as Alibaba.com, which</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">caters to international customers, and 1688.com, which caters to Chinese small businesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Besides that, there&#39;s Aliyun, for cloud and Web services, and Alipay, a PayPal-like service controlled by Ma and other Alibaba executives that can, among other things, hold buyers&#39; payment to manufacturers in escrow until they say they&#39;re satisfied with their goods. The group also has sizable stakes in Sina Weibo (think Twitter) and Youku Tudou (think YouTube).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">If that sounds like a lot, it is. But that diversity has won a considerable amount of applause from some</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">investors. As Ma told investors in Hong Kong, according to the Wall Street Journal, he wants Alibaba to be a &quot;zoo that houses many animals rather than a farm which just has one animal.&quot;</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Why does it matter that Alibaba is based in China?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">China is a force to be reckoned with in online retail, even though its population is much less wired than that of the United States. Only 46 percent of China&#39;s consumers have access to the Internet, compared with 82 percent in the United States, according to the McKinsey Global Institute:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Its origins in China have brought a few cultural quirks. Alibaba&#39;s biggest shopping day last year was Nov. 11, Singles Day, a satirical Chinese holiday celebrating the unmarried. Taobao and Tmall logged nearly $6 billion in sales in one day.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It also brings a big wildcard. The Chinese government wields powerful influence over the country&#39;s economic growth by spending money, imposing regulations and, as Alibaba said in a securities filing, &quot;providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.&quot; In other words, how Alibaba succeeds or fails could depend largely on China&#39;s power elite, and that&#39;s not very encouraging news for surprise-averse investors.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">At Alibaba&#39;s presentation Monday in Hong Kong, Ma reportedly told investors to &quot;think about us just like any other Internet company that happens to be in China.&quot; But the company has not been subtle about its particularly close ties with Chinese government leaders. Ma told a New York crowd that maintaining relationships with Chinese state officials was a top priority.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Because of their close relationships there, it puts Alibaba Group in a very favorable position in partnering with the government in high-potential, high-growth, high-regulation industries&quot; like investing and online banking, said Henry Guo, a senior research analyst for JG Capital. &quot;If the government wants to partner with a company</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">who&#39;s doing something big and new, Alibaba is a no. 1 partner in that.&quot;</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">Sounds interesting. Should I invest?</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s probably too late to jump on the first shares: U.S.-based investors needed to have their orders in by Tuesday afternoon, and Alibaba will close its books to new orders in Asia and Europe on Wednesday. Then it plans to set a final price for shares Thursday, with trading to begin Friday. Once the company is public, it&#39;s off to the races, and anyone can buy a share.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">As to whether you should, that&#39;s, of course, up to you. A lot of American investors have gotten excited over what seems like the clearest way to bet on China&#39;s growth. But some have questioned the company&#39;s convoluted maze of business interests and unorthodox leadership. Alibaba itself has said its future in China, due to the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">state government&#39;s whims and regulations, could prove hard to predict. And with rapid changes in Web retail and</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">mobile payments, Alibaba&#39;s success is far from guaranteed. (For a hint of the danger, look to Alibaba&#39;s own SEC filings, where their stated &quot;risk factors&quot; total nearly 27,000 words.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Alibaba&#39;s listing in New York, and its mammoth size, could give the company a better chance at success. But Chinese companies haven&#39;t typically blown the markets away. Chinese companies listed on American stock markets have seen their shares drop 1 percent every year on average for the next three years, far below the 7 percent average yearly gain for other U.S. IPOs, according to research by University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In a letter to employees shortly before Alibaba filed for its IPO in May, Ma acknowledged the hazards of going public with such a monstrous listing. But in a tone reminiscent of his schoolhouse past, he also remained chipper about Alibaba&#39;s months ahead.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Lying behind the massive allure of the capital market, there is unparalleled ruthlessness and pressure,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The past 15 years have been difficult and exciting. Every single day of the future is bound to be extraordinary and complicated. If we don&#39;t put in the effort today, we might not see the sunshine the day after tomorrow.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140917ea9h005sh</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark8">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark9">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon reveals 6 new tablets, e-readers</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Hayley Tsukayama 398 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">18 September 2014 The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">FINAL A15</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

Amazon is, after all, what Limp calls a &quot;content-forward&quot; company -- it sells its tablets and e-readers at break-even prices, and then makes money on the videos, apps, books and games that consumers buy from Amazon through them.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">&quot;The most important thing is when someone picks one of our devices, it has to be almost immediately clear why it&#39;s different,&quot; he said. And in most cases, he said, that comes from building less expensive gadgets that take full advantage of Amazon&#39;s own software and services.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The strategy hasn&#39;t always worked. In June, Amazon jumped into the smartphone market with the Fire Phone, a sensor-laden smartphone designed to give users direct access to Amazon&#39;s online store. Just six weeks later, the firm slashed the phone&#39;s price from $200 to 99 cents; Amazon hasn&#39;t released official sales numbers for the phone, but many analysts say the cut was due to lackluster sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Still, Amazon isn&#39;t straying from its well-worn formula with these new devices. With a new kid-focused version of the Kindle Fire tablet -- for children ages 3 to 10 -- Amazon is also including a year&#39;s subscription to its Kindle FreeTime Unlimited service. That service, which is normally a $30 per year add-on to the company&#39;s Prime service, gives parents and children unlimited access to hand-picked apps, games and videos made for kids.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, remains bullish on e-readers, even though the market may have peaked already in 2012. Limp called e-readers one of the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">company&#39;s &quot;passions.&quot; The latest addition to the line is the Kindle Voyage, a six-inch e-reader with a lighted e-ink screen and pressure-sensitive sensors that let you squeeze to advance or go back a page. Amazon is also releasing a lower-end, basic e-reader without a light, starting at $79, which offers twice as much storage as Amazon&#39;s previous entry-level Kindle. The company also unveiled a new six-inch Fire tablet, which starts at $99, and comes in five colors. A 7-inch version of the tablet starts at $139. Both boast clear sound, fast processors and crisp displays that are very rare to see at that price.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Despite its obsession with low prices, Amazon also released a new high-end tablet, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 , which starts at $379. The device, a competitor to Apple&#39;s iPad and Samsung&#39;s premium Galaxy tablets, has advanced processors, a clearer screen and speakers with Dolby designed surround sound. The new HDX is also designed to work with a new Fire keyboard from Amazon, sold separately for about $60, so that users can use the tablet more effectively for spreadsheets and other work documents.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s a bit of a shift for Amazon tablets, which have always been marketed more as devices to consume content rather than create it. Limp said that the shift was driven by customer use.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We have seen a trend, generation on generation, that people are using them more for productivity use cases,&quot; he said. &quot;As you start seeing customer input like that, you want to encourage it -- throw kindling on that fire, if you will.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon may build a business-focused tablet down the road, he said. The company has been slowly adding features suited to workplace devices, such as encryption. &quot;Will it take a long time? Yes,&quot; Limp said. &quot;But we have to get the building blocks, and keep making progress. And the early signs are good.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140918ea9i000gr</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark12">wonkblog</a><a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Surge, everyone’s favorite ’90s soda, is back, and it’s already selling like crazy</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Roberto A. Ferdman 575 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">16 September 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Coca-Cola has a little surprise for &#39;90s nostalgics: Surge soda, the company&#39;s equivalent to Mountain Dew, is back.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The global soda giant began selling the &quot;fully loaded citrus soda&quot; on Monday, more than 12 years since the brand was discontinued. The relaunch is part of a combined effort with Amazon.com, the only place where 12-packs of 16-ounce cans are being sold.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;SURGE is back!&quot; the product landing page reads.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">It&#39;s also selling like crazy. Amazon ran out of initial supplies of Surge only hours after Coca-Cola first announced the re-release Monday morning, according to the Huffington Post. Amazon managed to restock its supply of the novelty soda, but not for long— as of Tuesday afternoon, the online retailer is once again out of Surge.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Customers can sign up to receive an e-mail once the soda is in stock again.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Coca-Cola debuted Surge in 1996, at a time when PepsiCo&#39;s Mountain Dew enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">U.S. market for citrus sodas. That year, Pepsi&#39;s offering accounted for more than three-quarters of all &quot;heavy citrus&quot; soda sales, while Coca-Cola&#39;s, Mello Yello, struggled, according to a New York Times article from that December.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Like Mountain Dew, the new brand, known as Surge, will be a bright, greenish-yellow citrus drink that will be high in calories and caffeine, compared with other soft drinks. Coke has been slow to mount a credible challenge to Mountain Dew, which had retail sales of $3 billion last year in the $52 billion industry, placing it first among</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">so-called heavy citrus sodas. Mello Yello, which Coke has marketed regionally since 1979, has been a distant second.With Surge, Coca-Cola managed to bite a chunk out of Mountain Dew&#39;s dominance. Just three years later, in 1999, Mountain Dew&#39;s market share had fallen just over 66 percent. Advertisements for the new soda were nearly as excitable as the demand.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But soon the appeal of highly-caffeinated drinks waned, and schools, retailers and supermarkets stopped carrying it. In 2002, after years of falling sales, Coca-Cola pulled Surge from production.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The resurgence of Surge is owed at least in part to the soda&#39;s vocal social media fans, according to Coca-Cola. The Surge Movement, which was created for the sole purpose of bringing the citrus soda back into production, has nearly 150,000 likes on Facebook. The same community raised nearly $4,000 on Indie GoGo to buy a billboard near Coca-Cola&#39;s headquarters that read &quot;Dear Coke, we couldn&#39;t buy SURGE, so we bought this billboard instead.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Eventually, their creativity and passionate pleas caught the company&#39;s attention,&quot; Coca-Cola said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The return of Surge marks not only the first time Coca-Cola has reintroduced a discontinued product to the market, but also the first time Coca-Cola has sold any soda product exclusively online. If Surge continues to sell as it has over the past day, it likely won&#39;t be the last online exclusive.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;If expectations are met, this may be only the first of a variety of efforts we explore to launch niche products through e-commerce relationships,&quot; Wendy Clark, Coca-Cola&#39;s president of sparkling and strategic marketing, said in a written statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140916ea9g006vd</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark14">innovations</a><a name="bookmark15">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">How Alibaba will change the way we think about Chinese tech</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Dominic Basulto 956 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">12 September 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Alibaba IPO marks the beginning of a new era for how we think and write about China&#39;s Internet companies, and it&#39;s all being driven by Wall Street and the way it values companies. Everyone knows that Alibaba dominates the Chinese e-commerce market and that its upcoming initial public offering will be the biggest Internet IPO ever, dwarfing the size of the Facebook IPO in 2012. Now comes the hard part — going beyond all the basic elevator pitch explanations (&quot;it&#39;s the Chinese Amazon&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s the Chinese eBay&quot;) and actually figuring out how the company makes all of its money.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The IPO road show Alibaba is doing right now is all about trying to get the messaging right so that both retail and institutional investors &quot;get&quot; Alibaba and the IPO pops on the first day of trading. Think back to other big Internet IPOs. Retail investors were initially eager to buy into the Facebook IPO in 2012 or the Twitter IPO in 2013 because they understood what they did and how they made money (or, at least, how they planned to make money). That&#39;s a much bigger hurdle for Alibaba, which is usually described as something like the Amazon of China.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Easy to grasp, but is it really accurate?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Browse through even a few minutes of the Alibaba roadshow videos available on YouTube, and it&#39;s clear that the Alibaba e-commerce model differs significantly from the Amazon e-commerce model. Alibaba&#39;s model is more of an eBay marketplace model and the primary share of the company&#39;s profits come from providing services that help buyers market their businesses to sellers. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Alibaba as more of a Google-like &quot;advertising platform&quot; than an e-commerce platform. And Alibaba does that through a vast ecosystem of marketplaces that sell just about everything. In fact, Alibaba&#39;s mission statement is: &quot;To make it easy to do business anywhere.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">And that&#39;s where Wall Street plays an important role in assigning a valuation to Alibaba. Investors like to be able to value all the components of a company properly. It&#39;s no longer about China as some kind of &quot;black box&quot; that stands for &quot;lots of potential money there.&quot; It sounds awesome that Alibaba dominates 52 percent of all</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">e-commerce in China and that Alibaba sells 8 percent of everything in China. (By comparison, Walmart sells close to 10 percent of everything in America.) Alibaba has been growing at a blistering 50 percent pace as it expands into just about everything that can be sold online, but is that growth rate really sustainable?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Investors want to be able to peer into that black box and see what&#39;s inside. When it comes to Alibaba, investors are paying a lot of attention to the convoluted — some use the word &quot;tortuous&quot; — management and ownership structure of Alibaba to see what they get with their money. They also want to see if the company has  economic moats to keep out competitors. What about that JD.com, for example, which controls just over 18 percent of the Chinese e-commerce market — is that company an also-ran or an up-and-comer? And how well positioned is Alibaba to make the leap into mobile commerce?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Remember back to the big Facebook IPO in 2012? When people peered inside Facebook ahead of its IPO, it scared some forward-looking investors, and the stock nosedived after the IPO. There was huge concern on Wall Street that Facebook wasn&#39;t ready for the mobile era. In response, Facebook radically overhauled its approach to mobile. Within a year, Facebook derived 30 percent of its advertising revenue came from mobile.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Facebook&#39;s current enterprise value — $188 billion — is higher than what Alibaba is being valued at in today&#39;s market terms ($148 billion). For good measure, Amazon has a total enterprise value of $155 billion. eBay — which has more of the marketplace model favored by Alibaba — has an enterprise value of only $55 billion. So</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">which company would you rather hold in your portfolio a few weeks from now — Alibaba or Amazon? They have almost exactly the same valuations, but very different business models and very different growth perspectives.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The same issues faced by Alibaba apply as well as to other Chinese tech companies such as Tencent or Xiaomi or Weibo. Or, for that matter, to Alibaba&#39;s closest competitor — JD.com. We&#39;ve relied until now for a type of convenient (some might say lazy) shorthand for describing these Chinese companies — the &quot;Twitter of China&quot; (Weibo) or the &quot;Apple of China&quot; (Xiaomi). It&#39;s convenient to have this kind of shorthand in the early days as a type of elevator pitch for people with short attention spans. However, when it comes time to putting real money into a company, more is needed.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s why this Alibaba IPO is so important. It&#39;s time for China&#39;s tech companies to grow up. At the end of the day, it&#39;s business, not personal. If China&#39;s tech companies want Western money at Western valuations, then they need to explain how and why they differ from the Western market leaders. Is Alibaba really bigger and more valuable than Amazon? The days of blindly putting one&#39;s faith in the future growth rates of China&#39;s remarkable Internet companies are over. At some point in the near future, China&#39;s spectacular economic growth rates are going to come back down to earth, and that&#39;s when a solid understanding of Alibaba&#39;s business model is really going to matter.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140911ea9b00392</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark16">CapitalBusiness</a><a name="bookmark17">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Annual Digital East conference to showcase best practices</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">295 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">8 September 2014 The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">FINAL A02</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Federal officials on Thursday announced Google has agreed to settle charges and repay $19 million to consumers whose children were allegedly deceived into making mobile purchases through the Android app store.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Since 2011, according to the Federal Trade Commission, Google made it too easy for children to use Android phones to buy items ranging from 99 cents to $200 in kids-oriented games without a parent&#39;s permission.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The settlement is the latest in the FTC&#39;s three-year investigation into so-called &quot;in-app purchases&quot; on devices running software by Apple, Amazon and Google. The enforcement agency has said the purchases are deceptive and particularly harmful for children. Apple agreed to a $32.5 million settlement last January. Amazon in July said it would fight similar charges brought by the FTC.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The FTC has alleged that the major technology companies did not properly disclose to parents and children the ability to purchase items within games and other children&#39;s-oriented apps. Parents have filed civil lawsuits against the companies, too, criticizing the firms and apps developers for what they describe as predatory practices that target children to buy $99 gold coins and other items within games. Children, they say, were at times able to buy those items -- later billed to parents -- without any safeguards such as apps store passwords. Apple has changed its practices, and Amazon has offered parental safety tools to prevent unwanted purchases.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;For millions of American families, smartphones and tablets have become a part of their daily lives,&quot; FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a release. &quot;As more Americans embrace mobile technology, it&#39;s vital to remind companies that time-tested consumer protections still apply, including that consumers should not be charged for purchases they did not authorize.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">At first, Google didn&#39;t require passwords for in-app purchases. In 2012, though, following criticism from parents, it began to use pop-up password boxes. The FTC said the company didn&#39;t explain, however, that by putting in a password once, kids had a 30-minute window to rack up as many charges as they wanted. The FTC said even as Google faced a class action lawsuit and heavy criticism -- along with Apple and Amazon -- over in-app purchases being too easy for children, the company didn&#39;t do enough to explain its practices or change them to protect consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Parents, meanwhile, continue to complain about hundreds, even thousands of dollars in unauthorized charges. Parents said their kids didn&#39;t fully understand that a virtual in-app purchase for something like gold coins to advance game levels cost real money. The apps and software firms also made it too hard to understand their systems for in-app purchases, parents said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In its release, the FTC said Google employees internally referred to the problem as &quot;family fraud&quot; and &quot;friendly fraud.&quot; Apple and Google have changed their practices since the FTC&#39;s investigations and refund accounts.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Last month, author and mother of four, Ayelet Waldman blasted the Kim Kardashian app after her son spent $120 for things like virtual clothing.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google said in a statement that it has worked to change its in-app purchases.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re glad to put this matter behind us so we can focus on creating more ways for people to enjoy all the entertainment they love,&quot; Google said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Google has agreed to fully refund unauthorized in-app charges incurred by children and get &quot;express, informed consent&quot; from consumers for in-app purchases. The company said all Android customers who have made in-app charges will hear from Google about how they can get refunds.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Have more to say on this topic?

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The New York Times Magazine has a long look this weekend at Jill Soloway&#39;s &quot;Transparent,&quot; which will premiere its first season on Amazon Prime (disclosure: Amazon&#39;s CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns this paper) on Sept. 26.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The series is a fascinating exploration at a very particular period in transgender life: the time transgender people transition to living publicly in the gender that feels right to them, as opposed to the one they were assigned at birth. This obviously means a major social adjustment, and it can be a precursor to surgery. &quot;Transparent&quot; is also the rare show that does not simply capture a world in which there is apparently one transgender (or for that matter, one lesbian, gay or bisexual) person who exists mostly to educate the people in his or her life about the meaning of tolerance.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">I will have more thoughts on the content of the show when it comes to air, but I wanted to highlight one part of the Times piece, which describes how Soloway put the show together:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">To accomplish that, Soloway enacted a &quot;transfirmative action program,&quot; favoring the hiring of transgender candidates over nontransgender ones. It wasn&#39;t just a corrective to the trans community&#39;s high rates of unemployment. Soloway wanted to create a set on which inclusivity was more than a buzzword, a place where no one should ever feel that they are part of a majority — not even the majority, whoever that might be on a particular day. &quot;I really want it so that there&#39;s no moment, on the set, when trans people are being otherized by people in the crew because they don&#39;t think there are any trans people listening.&quot; As of this writing, 20 trans people had been hired in the cast and crew, and more than 60 had been employed as extras.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">I highlight this not because of any particular choice Soloway made, though many of them are interesting, but simply because it is a perfect illustration of the number of choices that go into making a television show or a movie. Changing the balance of representation in the media industry requires thinking about diversity every time you make every one of these choices on every single project. And given that this is a project-based industry, you can make all of these choices one year, only for the movie to be over or the TV show canceled the next.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">If you want to know why it is hard, these paragraphs are a pretty good illustration of the challenge. But they are also a strong illustration of the kind of comprehensive thinking that can make a difference.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140829ea8t006eo</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark24">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark25">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Server shipments up in second quarter Amazon wins Web security clearance</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">285 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">1 September 2014 The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">FINAL A13</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon has not even started airing its newest round of television shows, and it has already put up a new round of pilots for our consideration. (Standard disclosure: Amazon&#39;s CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns the Washington Post, which does not get me access to these pilots any earlier than the rest of you.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">I am curious about two things.

Amazon has used a similar approach with Time Warner&#39;s home video division this year, blocking pre-orders of discs for films including &quot;The Lego Movie.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon and Disney did not return requests for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The dispute will not immediately hurt Disney, because DVDs are a small part of its overall revenue, analysts say. But box-office sales have been lackluster and movie studios have placed greater attention on DVD and Blu-ray sales to extend the profits of its films.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The pricing dispute comes at a time when media and distribution companies are converging, with Amazon Instant Video serving as both a partner and competitor with Disney and other Hollywood studios.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;d say the companies are about as evenly matched as they get, but Amazon may have more leverage as the distributor because it can wait things out longer than Disney,&quot; said Tuna Amobi, an entertainment and media analyst for S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post, has demonstrated great determination in its increasing number of pricing disputes. Its dispute with the book publisher Hachette has only escalated over four months.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Over the weekend, 900 authors — including big names such as Steven King and Suzanne Collins — signed a petition that ran as a two-page ad in the New York Times. They said Amazon has singled them out for retaliation. Hachette has also accused Amazon of strong-arming the publishing industry with vast dominance in the e-books market. Amazon has tried to keep prices too low, Hachette and many authors say, which has harmed book writers and publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.readersunited.com/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon responded with a Web site at </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:SimSun; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 9pt;">www.readersunited.com</span>, where it defends its practices, saying the &quot;unjustifiably high&quot; prices Hachette wants to charge for e-books are not in the interest of consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com">cecilia.kang@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140811ea8b008eu</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark38">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark39">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Goods delivered by drone in 30 minutes?</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Catherine Ho 442 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">9 August 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">FINAL A12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Online retail giant Amazon has teamed with three drone manufacturers to push federal agencies and lawmakers to move forward with regulations for unmanned aerial vehicles.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The group&#39;s main goal is to urge the government to grant permission to companies to test and operate small commercial drones that weigh less than 55 pounds and fly under 400 feet or above 60,000 feet. The coalition is made up of Amazon&#39;s Prime Air unit and drone manufacturers DJI Innovations, Parrot Corp. and 3D Robotics.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post and associated publications, has expressed interest in starting a service for Amazon.com customers that would deliver packages via small drones in less than 30 minutes.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, are being used already by some law enforcement agencies to fight fires and photograph accident scenes. The Federal Aviation Administration in 2013 authorized the first commercial flight by a drone chartered by ConocoPhillips to scan the seafloor to survey marine mammals before drilling. But the group wants to expand the ways consumers and private companies can use drones to accomplish a host of other functions. Beyond delivering packages, they could be deployed for such uses as photographing real estate properties, tracking poachers who hunt game illegally and expanding broadband to parts of the world with limited access.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;The possibilities for [unmanned aerial vehicle] use are limitless,&quot; said lobbyist Michael E. Drobac of the law and lobbying firm Akin Gump, which is representing the group.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Drobac and fellow Akin Gump lobbyists Jennifer L. Richter and Gregory S. Walden have been meeting with staff and policymakers in Congress, the FAA, the Federal Communications Commission and the White House&#39;s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Most drone-related regulations fall under the authority of the FAA, but the FCC would deal with spectrum issues, and the White House&#39;s technology policy arm could have a hand in shaping privacy-related rules.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The FAA is slated to announce proposed rules for small commercial drones later this year. The agency estimates that by 2018, there could be as many as 7,500 small commercial drones in use in the United States. In 2013, the FAA announced six U.S. sites for drone research and testing in Alaska, North Dakota, Nevada, New York, Texas and Virginia.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://wapo.st/capbiz" class="a" target="_blank">Capital Business is The Post&#39;s publication focusing on the region&#39;s business community.

Here&#39;s a better option. ; A nonprofit</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">borrows tricks from Google, Amazon and Netflix to provide a better learning experience.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Matt McFarland 712 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">6 August 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">For years, high school students have received identical textbooks as their classmates. Even as students have different learning styles and abilities, they are force-fed the same materials. A nonprofit based at Rice University believes we can do better.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Imagine a digital textbook where because I&#39;m a different person and learn differently, my book is different than your book,&quot; said Richard Baraniuk, founder of OpenStax, which received a $9 million grant to develop a prototype textbook for AP Biology and high school physics. &quot;Because I understand things in a different way from you, the book itself should change. It&#39;s exploding this whole idea of this paper, canonical textbook and creating something that&#39;s much more like a pathway a student explores.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">OpenStax will spend two years developing the personalized, interactive books and then test them on</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Houston-area students. The idea is to make learning easier, so students can go on to more successful careers and lives.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Baraniuk isn&#39;t just reproducing physical textbooks on digital devices, a mistake eBook publishers have made. He&#39;s fundamentally rethinking what the educational experience should be in a world of digital tools.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">To do this means involving individuals with skills traditionally left out of the textbook business. Baraniuk is currently hiring cognitive scientists and machine learning experts.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Education in the future is going to be this type of team enterprise. Certainly there are going to be subject-matter experts and teachers. There are also going to be an increasing number of cognitive science experts and machine learning teachers and practitioners,&quot; Baraniuk predicts.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Baraniuk wants to use the tactics of Google, Netflix and Amazon to deliver a personalized experience. These Web services all rely on complex algorithms to automatically tailor their offerings for customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Just as Netflix recommends different movies based on your preferences and viewing history, a textbook might present materials at a different pace. The textbook — which will be housed in the cloud and viewable on a range of digital devices — will automatically adjust itself thanks to machine learning. As a student learns about a topic, she could be interrupted by brief quizzes that gauge her mastery of the area. Depending on how the student does, the subject could be reinforced with more material. Or a teacher could be automatically e-mailed that the student is struggling with a certain concept and could use some one-on-one attention.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This personalized learning experience is possible thanks to the wealth of data a digital textbook can track.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;You know which page a student is on. You also know as they&#39;re scrolling around where they might be within the page,&quot; Baraniuk said. &quot;You know when they&#39;ve clicked on different simulations, practice problems, videos, etc. You have a sense of whether they&#39;re playing those videos through to the end, going back to review material.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Baraniuk also envisions using this data to better track students&#39; progress throughout a course. Parents and teachers can monitor a student&#39;s development and chime in with more fitting assistance.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">His research on his own students at Rice has convinced him of the power of information presentation on how well a student learns. Baraniuk found that when he began spacing out homework on given lessons throughout a semester, his students&#39; grades improved by between a half and full grade point. Rather than cramming — where what is learned is quickly forgotten — the extended approach to learning created superior recall.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The books will go through a peer-reviewed vetting process similar to traditional textbooks, Baraniuk said. He expects 60 people to review each book before publication to ensure its quality.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Given the wealth of data and personalization that digital learning experiences can provide, it&#39;s reasonable to expect students&#39; achievement levels to leap forward thanks to the digital age. With personalized learning methods, our students&#39; talents will be better developed. It&#39;s an exciting possibility, and let&#39;s hope more attention goes to reinventing the textbook. Paper textbooks got a lot of us through school successfully, but now something even better is possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140806ea86003jz</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark42">pr</a><a name="bookmark43">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Digiday: One year in — 10 ways The Washington Post has changed under Jeff Bezos</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By WashPostPR 139 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">5 August 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

From Digiday&#39;s Lucia Moses:</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">A year ago, Jeff Bezos stunned the media world with the news that he was buying The Washington Post for $250 million. With his jumble of businesses, the founder of Amazon seemed an unlikely buyer for a newspaper that was losing money. But given moves he has made to try to reinvent the media business (Amazon, the Kindle — and Kindle Singles e-books and Amazon Studios, units that give creators new outlets for their work), expectations that the billionaire entrepreneur would transform the Post into a hotbed of experimentation were high. Now flush with resources, the paper has begun hiring again and introduced a number of initiatives.

But, until now, neither Amazon nor Hachette had spelled out exactly what the two companies were fighting over. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In a post on its company&#39;s forums Tuesday, Amazon said that it would like to see most e-books priced at $9.99, rather than the common $14.99 or $19.99 prices that publishers set for digital copies of their books. Amazon argued that while it doesn&#39;t want every e-book to be set at $9.99, using that price for the majority of digital books would benefit customers, publishers and Amazon itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Lowering prices by roughly one-third, Amazon said, would encourage customers to buy more books, therefore increasing the size of the e-book market overall. According to its own number-crunching, the company said that the lower price could improve book sales on Amazon by 74 percent. For instance, said Amazon, an e-book that would sell 100,000 copies at $14.99 would be poised to sell 174,000 copies with a $9.99 price tag.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Overall, the company said, revenue would actually go up, roughly 16 percent. &quot;At $9.99, even though the customer is paying less, the total pie is bigger and there is more to share amongst the parties,&quot; the company said in the post.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The online retailer has advocated setting e-book prices at $9.99 before. In fact, a similar plan from Amazon is what prompted Apple to reach out to book publishers in 2008 about what it called &quot;the $9.99 problem&quot; -- discussions that eventually drew the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice. Apple and five major book publishers were charged with colluding to raise e-book prices in 2012. All the publishers, including Hachette, settled out of court without admitting wrongdoing. Apple has appealed that decision, and the case is pending.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon alluded to that history in its Tuesday post, saying, &quot;the 30% share of total revenue is what Hachette forced us to take in 2010 when they illegally colluded with their competitors to raise e-book prices. We had no problem with the 30% -- we did have a big problem with the price increases.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hachette Book Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon also laid out how it believes revenues from e-book sales should be divided: It would like to keep 30 percent of e-book revenues, and the remaining 70 percent would go to Hachette -- a take that Amazon said it would like to see the group share evenly with authors.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Authors affected by the fight between Amazon and Hachette have been outspoken on both sides of the issue, though the majority have said that dragging out the dispute hurts the industry overall.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Have more to say about this topic?

But what&#39;s different about watching this tutorial video on Amazon is that, next to the video, you can browse 55 items related to the video you just watched, including chopsticks and sushi-making tools, which are available</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">to purchase on Amazon.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s the general idea behind Amazon&#39;s Video Shorts site, quietly launched as a new part to its existing Instant Video Web site. According to a Amazon spokesperson, the Video Shorts destination within Amazon&#39;s Instant Video was added within the past couple weeks. The content previously surfaced only within relevant search results. The site features free short video clips including movie and game trailers, music videos, concert clips, author interviews, how-to tutorial videos for beauty, food and technology, all framed by relevant products available to buy on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">So it&#39;s like Amazon meets YouTube. Like YouTube, the Video Shorts content has run-time, a short description and a comments and review section. Unlike YouTube, most videos on Amazon&#39;s site seem to be produced by companies rather than individuals. The Amazon spokesperson said the company is working with a variety of content partners on video licensing, but refused to provide any specific details.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Although Amazon&#39;s new video section looks like a rival to many free-video Web sites, the company seems more interested in promoting the platform itself than any specific brand or company. Currently the site features videos from Howcast, Vox Media, Universal, Sony, Disney and others. But as Mashable pointed out, users can&#39;t click on the name of the channel to see all the videos uploaded by that company, which is &quot;an odd choice that could be a mere oversight or indicate that Amazon is more interested in promoting the platform over any one brand.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon didn&#39;t respond to the request for more details except to say that &quot;our focus has been (and remains) focused on growing our content selection for customers.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon may still have a long way to go to make its video business a rival to Google&#39;s YouTube, but the company had been ambitious in expanding its e-commerce sales and growing into new areas, from introducing its own smartphone Fire to announcing its 3D printing business which makes it possible for consumers to buy a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">3D-printed coffee cup or bubble-heads.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;The company&#39;s ambitions are seemingly boundless, with investments in everything from cloud infrastructure and services to mobile devices and consumer hardware. The company wants to deliver groceries to your door, ship its products via drone, stream media to all your screens, and even produce its own TV shows and games,&quot; Sarah Perez, wrote in TechCrunch. &quot;It shouldn&#39;t then come as any surprise that Amazon would also see its Instant Video Service as something that could not only take on iTunes and Netflix, but potentially YouTube as well…at least, one day.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Seattle-based e-commerce retailer posted a $19.3 billion revenue for the second quarter of 2014, a 23 percent rise from $15.7 billion in the same quarter last year. Amazon expects third-quarter revenue between</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">$19.7 billion and $21.5 billion. Amazon CEO Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon announced Monday that it&#39;s adding a section devoted to 3D printing to its store, which could make the technology more accessible to the average consumer.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The ultimate promise of 3D printing is that consumers will be able to get whatever they want at the very moment they want it. Broke your coffee cup? Just fire up your printer, maybe download a blueprint, and get cracking. But there are still plenty of average consumers who may not want to invest in a mini-manufacturing hub for their living room.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Where the technology has had the most potential so far has been for small businesses that use the printers to make small runs of super-customizable goods. Sites such as Etsy, for example, have thousands of 3D-printed products for sale -- aimed at people who may not want their own 3D printer but like the idea of being able to design their own goods without breaking the bank.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s exactly the market that Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey Bezos owns The Washington Post, appears to be targeting now.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;The introduction of our 3D Printed Products store suggests the beginnings of a shift in online retail - that manufacturing can be more nimble to provide an immersive customer experience. Sellers, in alignment with designers and manufacturers, can offer more dynamic inventory for customers to personalize and truly make their own,&quot; said Petra Schindler-Carter, director for Amazon Marketplace Sales, in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The 3D printing store looks a lot like the smaller storefronts Amazon has launched to promote new product trends, most notably the section for wearable tech that the company began promoting this past spring.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">As with the wearables section, the 3D printing store is starting small. According to the release, there are around 200 goods in the on offer, such as pieces of jewelry, cellphone cases and toys.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Some sellers offer more design options than others. In some cases, you may just have a lot of color options for a pair of earrings, very similar to the customization options you&#39;d see in the normal jewelry section. Other goods, such as the custom bobbleheads on offer from Mixee, give you a wider range of design choices to allow you</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">to make dolls that look like you or your friends.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon said in the release that it plans to continue expanding the store over time, and even included a link to the application to become a seller.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140728ea7s005ei</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark54">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark55">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Stocks slump amid worries about consumer spending</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Associated Press 491 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">26 July 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">FINAL A13</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">NEW YORK - Investors got some bad news about the U.S. shopper Friday, driving down stocks and sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a loss for the week.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Two major U.S. companies - retail giant Amazon.com and credit card processor Visa - said the second half of the year was looking more troubled than originally expected. The cautious outlook from two companies so heavily exposed to consumer spending spooked investors, causing the stock market to fall at the open and remain lower throughout the day.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Visa put a lot of caution into the market this morning,&quot; said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Dow dropped 123.23 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,960.57. It&#39;s the first time the Dow has closed below the psychologically notable 17,000-point mark since July 9. The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500-stock index fell 9.64 points, or</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">0.5 percent, to 1978.34, and the Nasdaq composite fell 22.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4449.56.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">With Friday&#39;s selling, the Dow fell 0.8 percent this week. The S&amp;P 500 closed basically unchanged, and the Nasdaq rose 0.4 percent this week.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Visa was the biggest decliner among the blue chips, falling $7.97, or 3.6 percent, to $214.77. The credit card processor reported an 11 percent rise in quarterly profit but cut its full-year forecast on concerns about growth overseas.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Because the Dow is a price-weighted index, and Visa is the most expensive stock in the Dow, Visa was having an outsized impact on it. About 60 points of the Dow&#39;s decline can be attributed to Visa.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s quarterly results didn&#39;t help boost investor sentiment, either.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s stock slumped nearly 10 percent after the online retail giant late Thursday posted a much wider loss than analysts had forecast, hit by expenses. The Seattle-based company is focused on spending the money it makes to expand into new areas and products, including a smartphone, the Fire, which started selling Friday. Chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon fell $34.60 to close at $324.01, the biggest decliner in the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Investors retreated from riskier stocks and moved into traditional havens at times of uncertainty: bonds and gold. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note eased to 2.46 percent from 2.50 percent late Thursday as demand for the government bond rose. Gold climbed $12.60, or 1 percent, to $1,305.30 an ounce.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Despite the disappointing news from the consumer-focused companies, corporate earnings from the latest quarter have been solid. Of the 230 companies that have reported, 76 percent have beaten profit expectations and 67 percent have beaten sales expectations, according to FactSet.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20140726markets0726</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020140726ea7q0000o</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark56">the-switch</a><a name="bookmark57">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon employee admits to drone fly-by at Seattle&#39;s Space Needle ; He eagerly showed the video to</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seattle Police, then agreed to stop flying the drone in public.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Abby Phillip 306 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">25 July 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

They claimed the drone crashed into the observation deck window.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The white, camera-equipped, four-propeller device then glided back into the fifth floor window of a nearby hotel.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">When police caught up with the drone&#39;s owner, it turned out to be an Amazon employee who eagerly showed them video of the drone&#39;s flight, which didn&#39;t indicate that it had struck the Needle during its journey, according to a Seattle Police Department blog post.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">And, no, this wasn&#39;t a test-drive of Prime Air, which Amazon (whose chief executive, Jeffrey P.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlement with the Wall Street bank.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Fire Phone hits the AT&amp;T network Thursday. It is Amazon&#39;s first foray into the smartphone world and a particularly clear articulation of how chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos thinks Amazon should fit into its customers&#39; daily lives.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Which is to say, in every possible way.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">There&#39;s no denying that this is, whole hog, an Amazon phone - and in a very personal way. Information about my latest Amazon order was immediately accessible, with a flick of the wrist. So, too, were recommendations for books, movies and music that I might like based on things I&#39;ve bought in my decade or so as an Amazon customer. The phone also comes with a free year of Amazon&#39;s $99 Prime subscription, which gives users access to unlimited streaming video, streaming music and two-day shipping at no extra cost.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Recent apps, books or movies you use show up in the &quot;carousel&quot; feature - a menu of large icons that act as shortcuts to the latest things you&#39;ve opened - along with suggestions of what to buy. Users have the option to turn off the recommendations. You can also remove carousel items if it starts feeling cluttered.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">As a tie-in to Amazon, then, the Fire Phone has no parallel. But as a phone? The story gets a bit more complicated.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In many ways, it is a good piece of hardware. Its 4.7-inch screen is great for video without being so big that it stretches your hands. It&#39;s dense, but not heavy, and feels like a premium product. The phone&#39;s battery life is a bit short - I had to recharge in the course of a normal day of use - so users will have to keep a cord handy.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The screen is a main selling point, ably showing off high-quality, streaming video and visual effects such as &quot;Dynamic Perspective&quot; - a feature where apps respond based on the way you hold the phone relative to your head. In apps that use Dynamic Perspective, images shift as you tilt your head. In many of Amazon&#39;s own apps, slightly tilting the phone away from you will also bring up little pieces of information, similar to mouse-over text on a Web site.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Far and away, the best feature of the phone is the amount of memory it has. The Fire Phone comes in two basic models: one with 32 gigabytes of memory, and one with 64GB, as opposed to the iPhone, which starts with 16GB at the low end.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The review unit provided by AT&amp;T to The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon chief executive Bezos, was the smaller of the two, but it still left me with plenty of room for downloading videos, music, apps and books. That makes sense, considering all of the media that Amazon wants you to put on the phone. The device&#39;s storage comes in addition to unlimited cloud storage for any photos you take on the Fire Phone&#39;s 13-megapixel camera.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That camera also acts as your main portal to commerce, by way of the &quot;Firefly&quot; text and product recognition feature, which allows users to scan book covers and bar codes. Users can activate Firefly by holding down the dedicated camera button on the side of the phone. Firefly is the sort of feature that seems useful but needs to be assessed over a longer period of time. It was also nice to be able to call up the feature to pull phone numbers and e-mail addresses from printed material with reasonable accuracy - my name isn&#39;t &quot;Tsukoyama,&quot; but it&#39;s close.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Even at my desk, Firefly was able to identify several items simply by scanning their bar codes, which in turn called up a product listing on Amazon. Not every product gets recognized every time, making it more of a neat trick than an indispensable tool, for now.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Many other software features had that same feel of being cool ideas that needed a few more rounds of testing to be ready for prime time. The look of the menus can be a bit jarring - ugly, even. And the basic navigation design of the phone&#39;s operating system was still a little rough around the edges. Users tilt the phone to access menus on the left and right sides of the phone, but sometimes the movement didn&#39;t trigger the menus. Other times it required a movement so sharp that it felt the phone could have flown out of my hand.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Finally, I had trouble getting Amazon&#39;s instant customer service feature, Mayday, to fire up consistently due to a weak WiFi or cellular signal. But it works well when you can connect, and the on-call staff responds promptly to questions. It&#39;s a feature that would be particularly useful if the Fire Phone were aimed at people buying their first smartphones.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">All in all, the Fire Phone is a good device that needs another layer of polish. There are a lot of elements here that are promising. But there&#39;s room to improve, and the phone is a little too rough to recommend to anyone who isn&#39;t a die-hard Amazon shopper.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20140724fire0724</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020140724ea7o0001f</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark64">Editorial-Opinion</a><a name="bookmark65">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Read the fine print on Amazon plan</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">116 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">23 July 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">FINAL A20</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon.com introduced a new subscription service, Kindle Unlimited, on Friday. This $9.99 per month, all-you-can-eat feature gives you full access to a hundreds of thousands of e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bookworms, wipe your mouths; that drooling is unsightly.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But before you run out and sign up for the free trial, here are some things to consider before you make your decision.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How many books do you read per year?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Kindle Unlimited is $9.99 per month. So you&#39;ll be paying Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey Bezos owns The Washington Post, around $120 per year for the unfettered e-book access. If you&#39;re habitually spending money on more than one book per month, then it&#39;s a service to think about. It has its perks for big book buyers -- namely that don&#39;t have to worry about spending money on a book you end up hating.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But, chances are, you aren&#39;t reading more than one book per month. In January, the Pew Internet and American Life Project asked how many books the typical American had read in the past year.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The answer? Five.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">There&#39;s no judgment here. Books take time to consume--and require undivided attention. (Even is tough.) But just remember that if you&#39;re not one of those folks reading at least 13 books a year, then a $10 per month book service is probably not a top priority.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Is there another service that could be a better fit?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Part of what makes Amazon&#39;s service so appealing is the fact they&#39;re offering you access to a catalog of 600,000 e-books. But that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you&#39;ll be able to read any book that you want. Amazon&#39;s Kindle Unlimited catalog is heavy on classics, famous series such as &quot;Harry Potter&quot; or &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and, of course, the books that authors self-publish on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But if you want any of the top five current New York Times fiction bestsellers, for example, you&#39;re not going to find them in the Unlimited catalog. (They&#39;re on Amazon, just not as a part of the Kindle Unlimited pool.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">I recently did a rundown of other companies that are trying to be the &quot;Netflix for books,&quot; before this announcement. What I found is that no book subscription service has everything you want to read.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Oyster, for example, has access to a lot of the back-catalogues of publishers big and small, but not many bestsellers. Scribd has a great selection of quicker reads, thanks to a broad selection of documents, poetry and short stories. And Entitle, another type of books subscription service, does have bestsellers from Simon &amp; Schuster and HarperCollins -- but there&#39;s a limit to how many books you can buy per month.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Basically, the service that fits you best is the one that matches up with your reading list. If you have to read the latest novel now, having a Kindle Unlimited subscription won&#39;t help you.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How does this fit in with my Prime subscription?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It doesn&#39;t. Prime members -- who already pay $99 per year to Amazon for two-day shipping, streaming music, streaming video and a limited number of e-books at no extra cost -- don&#39;t get any extra perks here. Amazon has launched this as a separate service. Sorry.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What about Audible?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Kindle Unlimited does pose some interesting possibilities for subscribers to Audible, Amazon&#39;s audiobook service. The service includes some unlimited access to narrated books, or e-books that come with audio tracks. Amazon already offers a lot of e-books that will sync with the title&#39;s corresponding audiobook. It&#39;s convenient, actually, for when you&#39;re trying to get through a book and multitask--read some in bed and then pick up some more while you&#39;re doing chores around the house. At the same time, not everyone wants to pay twice for the same book.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Kindle Unlimited solves that particular problem, but trading your Audible membership for a Kindle Unlimited membership also means giving up a big chunk of the current Audible library. There are around 2,000 books with audio tracks on Kindle Unlimited right now. Audible boasts over 150,000 titles.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">If you can&#39;t decide whether you should give up your Audible membership for a Kindle Unlimited sign-up, Amazon isn&#39;t making you choose just yet. Kindle Unlimited comes with a free three-month subscription to Audible.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140719ea7j000dx</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 1/Image_006.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark68">the-switch</a><a name="bookmark69">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon launches a Netflix-style subscription service for books</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Brian Fung 589 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">19 July 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Amazon has just announced that it&#39;s unveiling a monthly subscription service that&#39;ll let you read as many e-books as you want. The service, called Kindle Unlimited, gives customers access to Amazon&#39;s catalog of 600,000 Kindle books and &quot;thousands&quot; of audio books.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Here&#39;s how it&#39;ll work: For a monthly fee of $9.99, Kindle users can browse the Amazon bookstore and wherever they see the logo for Kindle Unlimited, they&#39;ll be able to download the title for free. Decide you don&#39;t like a book halfway through? Pick another one.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The business model should look familiar to anyone who&#39;s binged on &quot;House of Cards&quot; and &quot;Orange is the New Black.&quot; But it&#39;s now being applied to a very different industry. And if it takes off, Amazon would be the perfect company to extend it to even more retail sectors. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">All this is happening against the backdrop of a larger struggle between Amazon and publishers, who disagree over how much Amazon should pay its suppliers for e-books. Question is, will Kindle Unlimited drive e-book prices even lower? Or could this alternative help drive more money to companies like Hachette?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">To understand what might happen, we have to look at how the revenues are determined. Typically, once a subscriber has read a certain percentage of a given book, it&#39;s considered a &quot;sale,&quot; and the company that runs the subscription pays the publisher for it — at retail prices, not wholesale, according to Robert Gottlieb, chairman of the Trident Media Group.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;That percentage can be anywhere from 20 percent to 25 percent,&quot; said Gottlieb.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That the retailer pays a slightly higher price for the books could be a boon to authors and publishers. But it could undermine the trade paperback business, Gottlieb added. That&#39;s because books from services like Amazon Unlimited are typically older titles. If people begin reading more of those on their e-readers, the industry that produces paperback reprints of hardcover books could suffer.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The e-book subscription space is already pretty crowded; my colleague Hayley Tsukayama reviewed three other services here. With Amazon now joining, it&#39;ll be a surprise if it doesn&#39;t wind up dominating the business over time. Amazon&#39;s sheer size means that, just as with the normal e-book business, it&#39;ll have a lot of power to set that percentage that determines when a book has been &quot;sold.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Amazon can leverage whatever percentage they want,&quot; said Gottlieb. &quot;They can say, &#39;We&#39;re not going to take your books if you don&#39;t do this.&#39;&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Could Kindle Unlimited have been a factor in the ongoing dispute between Amazon and Hachette? It&#39;s unlikely; the disagreement has more to do with how to sell books that are just coming on the market, rather than how to sell books that have already been available for a year or more. A Hachette spokesperson didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">One other advantage Amazon has over other e-book subscription services? It&#39;s got its hands in so many other industries that it could easily export it to other areas of its business.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Have more to say about this topic?

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Federal regulators announced Thursday it has filed a lawsuit against Amazon.com for allegedly making it too easy for children to make purchases when using mobile apps without a parent&#39;s permission.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Federal Trade Commission said Amazon charged parents millions of dollars of unauthorized payments for what&#39;s known as &quot;in-app purchases,&quot; typically make-believe items popularly offered within mobile games such as Candy Crush Saga that enhance a game or allow a user to advance levels.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The FTC said in its suit that it seeks a court order for the company to refund families affected by the unauthorized charges that began in 2011. It also wants the court to permanently ban Amazon from charging parents for in-app purchases without their consent.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The FTC alleges that beginning in November 2011, Amazon violated the FTC Act by billing parents for charges incurred by their children without permission. Amazon&#39;s Kindle Fire tablet was used by children to play games and spend &quot;unlimited amounts of money&quot; to pay for virtual items within the apps such as &quot;coins,&quot; &quot;stars,&quot; and &quot;acorns&quot; without parental involvement, the agency wrote in a release. The FTC said that at first, no password requirements were put in place to stop children from making the purchases.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Amazon&#39;s in-app system allowed children to incur unlimited charges on their parents&#39; accounts without permission,&quot; said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez. &quot;Even Amazon&#39;s own employees recognized the serious problem its process created. We are seeking refunds for affected parents and a court order to ensure that Amazon gets parents&#39; consent for in-app purchases.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Just a month after apps were introduced into Amazon&#39;s store, internal emails between staff showed the company was concerned about in-app purchases being made without password protection, according to the government. It was &quot;…clearly causing problems for a large percentage of our customers,&quot; said an email cited in the FTC&#39;s suit. The situation, according to the Amazon email, was a &quot;near house on fire.&quot; The FTC said thousands of parents complained to Amazon about charges made by children through in-app purchases.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The company changed its policy in 2012, requiring passwords for purchases over $20. Still, complaints piled up, according to the FTC suit. In 2013, it required greater password protections but still allowed for a 15-minute window for unlimited purchases after an authorizing password was used.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It took the FTC&#39;s lawsuit, approved last month, for Amazon to further strengthen its in-app purchases policy for newer devices, the FTC said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Lawmakers and child development experts have criticized in-app purchases in child-oriented apps because children often don&#39;t realize they are making real purchases for items such as gold coins that ultimately show up on their parent&#39;s bills.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In the game Ice Age Village, for instance, gold coins and acorns can be purchased for as much as $99 per item. One mother complained to Amazon of $358.42 in unauthorized charges, according to the FTC; some parents</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">complained to the company that children who could not read were able to &quot;click a lot of buttons at random&quot; and rack up charges.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The Federal Trade Commission&#39;s suit comes after months of talks with Amazon about the company&#39;s policy for in-app purchases. The FTC asked for the Seattle retailing and tech giant to abide by guidelines the agency has put forward for rival Apple, which settled FTC charges along these lines earlier this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">According to reports, Amazon defends its practices and said it shouldn&#39;t be held by the same requirements as Apple. The company has said it prefers to defend its policy for disclosures in court.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document WPCOM00020140711ea7b0008d</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark74">Amazon wants an exemption from the FAA&#39;s drone restrictions ; Rapid innovation requires that Amazon be allowed to test Prime Air in its own private R&amp;D facilities, the company argues.</a><a name="bookmark75">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Brian Fung 576 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">11 July 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Remember how Amazon wants to deliver its packages to you by drone in 30 minutes or less? And remember the federal government&#39;s objections to letting those and other commercial drones fly in U.S. airspace?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Well, Amazon is hoping to get around those. So it&#39;s filed a petition with the Federal Aviation Administration asking for an exemption.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In a filing to the agency this week, Amazon says that it&#39;s made tremendous strides with its drone technology. It&#39;s now working on eighth- and ninth-generation copter designs, just three months after the company&#39;s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, told shareholders Amazon was drawing up plans for its seventh-gen drone. (Bezos is also the owner of The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Other details appear in the filing that the company hasn&#39;t disclosed before: Its drones are capable of flying at 50 miles per hour, for instance. And the team working on them contains &quot;world‐renowned roboticists, scientists, aeronautical engineers, remote sensing experts and a former NASA astronaut.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But the bulk of the filing is devoted to Amazon&#39;s main purpose, which is two-fold: To get permission from the FAA to put its drones in the air, and to be able to test them at its own research facilities in Washington state rather than having to visit one of the six test sites that the agency approved late last year. Amazon says it&#39;s willing to take extra safety precautions, such as flying no higher than 400 feet above ground level, keeping the drone within visual range and readying a &quot;physical button&quot; that can cut power to the machine if something goes wrong.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re continuing to work with the FAA to meet Congress&#39;s goal of getting drones flying commercially in America safely and soon,&quot; said Paul Misener, Amazon&#39;s vice president of global public policy. &quot;We want to do more R&amp;D close to home.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Testing the drones right where they&#39;re designed would save the company time — while conveniently shielding the machines from public view.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s petition comes a week after the Motion Picture Association of America made its own request to the FAA for a special pass, and a month before the agency is supposed to publish new rules allowing lightweight commercial drones into U.S. airspace. Few expect the FAA to meet the deadline. The agency&#39;s sluggishness to develop regulations has raised questions about whether the United States is lagging behind in the civil and commercial drone industries. Other countries where drone policy isn&#39;t as strict have seen a surge of economic activity surrounding the technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s filing to the FAA alludes to the international draw.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Because Amazon is a commercial enterprise we have been limited to conducting R&amp;D flights indoors or in other countries,&quot; the proposal reads. &quot;Of course, Amazon would prefer to keep the focus, jobs and investment of this important research and development initiative in the United States.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the petition is rejected, well… draw your own conclusions.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Have more to say about this topic?

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The contract dispute between Amazon.com and Hachette Book Group has delayed the shipment of thousands of titles. The battle took another turn this week as Amazon reached out to Hachette authors with an offer to immediately begin offering the delayed books again and give its share of Hachette digital book sales to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">the authors for the duration of the dispute -- if the publisher would also forgo its share of the revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What do authors think? Authors Guild president Roxana Robinson isn&#39;t buying it, saying the offer is merely a tactic to bully the publisher into conceding to unfavorable terms.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">When presented with that argument, Amazon said in a statement late Wednesday that writers against the deal, such as Robinson, are &quot;conflating the long-term structure of the industry with a short-term proposal designed to take authors...out of the line of fire.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Given her position as the head of an author&#39;s advocacy group, it is hard to believe she could be against such an offer,&quot; the company said of Robinson. &quot;She&#39;s the leader of the Authors Guild, not the Publishers Guild.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">This is not the first time that the guild, which represents about 9,000 writers, has found itself at odds with Amazon and other tech giants over moves to take books into the digital age. The group has also been critical of publishers, saying that those companies &quot;regularly put the squeeze&quot; on their authors when discussing e-book royalty rates. It&#39;s also worth noting that there are a number of self-published authors who&#39;ve welcomed Amazon&#39;s rise in the e-book industry -- including several who circulated a petition in support of Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Robinson took some time Wednesday to chat by phone with The Washington Post about the guild&#39;s position on the offer from Amazon. The following has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What&#39;s your reaction to this Amazon proposal?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Generally speaking, I think that authors are still stuck in the middle of this, which is disheartening because we supply the product. We supply the books, which both Amazon and the publishing houses need.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Amazon letter didn&#39;t really take us out of the middle; it asked us to take sides against our publishers. It also seems to assume that what we really want is a short-term windfall, which is what we get if Amazon asked Hachette to give up revenues from e-books. But we want a healthy publishing ecosystem, a system of commerce in which we&#39;re not trying to kill each other or drive each other out of business.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What would that system look like?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">I think, at the moment, that because Amazon has such a huge share of the market, it would be great if there was some other force brought to bear on it to break it up.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do you mean government intervention?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Having the government step in would be one way. I don&#39;t know the legal definition of a monopoly, but when a single company has so much power, that would be a situation in which legal intervention would make sense.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Or another thing is that when a company is larger than a certain size, there can be moves internally to break them up. Or to change things when a company dominates the marketing of the product and is trying to take over the whole branch of the industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">One interesting thing that happened yesterday is that HarperCollins is starting to sell directly. So consumers no longer need to go to Amazon. That would be a way to change this.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon says that their proposal is of particular benefit to mid-list authors; do you foresee a schism?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">If they really wanted to benefit mid-list authors, they could have refrained from taking them off the site in the first place. Or they could have offered single-handedly to give up its revenues from e-books. That letter suggests Hachette will be giving up something without asking Hachette first.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">We don&#39;t know what the terms are between Hachette and Amazon. It&#39;s a complicated offer that [Amazon is] making, and it&#39;s not as simple as they would like to make it seem.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve been in touch with other people at the Authors Guild. We&#39;re trying to represent everyone, which includes those authors who are self-published and trying to protect them as well. And we&#39;re looking toward the long-term; we want the best arrangement possible for writers in the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What do you think the best arrangement would be?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">We don&#39;t know what Amazon&#39;s plans are. I understand why people would go to Amazon, and accept this deal. The terms are very welcoming. But we don&#39;t know what the terms would be like in the long-term.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The sense that we have is that Amazon is pursuing every one of their partners. And at a certain point, squeezing the supplier is no longer sustainable. Amazon&#39;s response is they [Hachette] can afford this; that&#39;s not a constructive attitude toward a partner that you want to be vital, energetic and healthy.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It would be better for all of us if we all agree that everyone should have enough profit. We shouldn&#39;t go after every cent that we can take out of everyone else&#39;s hide.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140710ea7a004sa</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 1/Image_007.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark80">the-switch</a><a name="bookmark81">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon makes an offer to Hachette authors</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 848 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">9 July 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon.com has an offer for authors at the book publisher Hachette, which is embroiled in a fight with the Internet retailer over e-book prices: Amazon will restore the authors&#39; books to its Web site and give writers all of the revenue from digital sales of their books.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;If Hachette agrees, for as long as this dispute lasts, Hachette authors would get 100 percent of the sales price of every Hachette e-book we sell,&quot; Amazon said in a letter sent to authors and literary agents. &quot;Both Amazon and Hachette would forego all revenue and profit from the sale of every e-book until an agreement is reached.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Hachette confirmed in a statement that Amazon has sent it a brief proposal to this effect, but says the best solution would be to resolve the dispute as quickly as possible. The publisher and Amazon have been fighting over the pricing of e-books and what share each of the firms will get from digital sales. The publisher alleges that the Web retailer is purposefully not delivering Hachette books promptly, even though the titles are in stock and available.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We invite Amazon to withdraw the sanctions they have unilaterally imposed, and we will continue to negotiate in good faith and with the hope of a swift conclusion,&quot; the publisher said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">But Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post, has made clear that it&#39;s ready to play hardball. In a statement Tuesday, the firm referred to earlier comments from the publisher that accepting Amazon&#39;s offer would be suicidal. Amazon countered that Hachette would be more than able to afford the sort of deal the retailer proposes.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">&quot;We call baloney,&quot; the Amazon statement said. &quot;Hachette is part of a $10 billion global conglomerate. It wouldn&#39;t be &#39;suicide.&#39; They can afford it. What they&#39;re really making clear is that they absolutely want their authors caught in the middle of this negotiation because they believe it increases their leverage.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">According to Hachette&#39;s Web site, the publisher makes approximately 33 percent of its sales from e-books; the New York Times reported that around 60 percent of that business comes through Amazon. A New Yorker report in February estimated that 7 percent of Amazon&#39;s revenues come from books.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Authors should not have their books held hostage as a bargaining chip, said Robert Gottlieb, chairman of Trident Media Group, a literary agency.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">&quot;I feel from an author&#39;s standpoint that what matters to them is that their books are available,&quot; said Gottlieb. And retailers, he said, have the right to conduct business as they see fit.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, authors are still weighing the pros and cons of accepting such a deal. Some authors feel that Amazon&#39;s proposal is unfair and asks writers to burn bridges with their publishing company.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;re asking us authors to load Amazon&#39;s guns for them,&quot; said Doug Preston, a best-selling author who had penned a letter asking Amazon to resolve its dispute with Hachette. That letter, which he circulated to other writers, has thus far gathered at least 400 signatures from notable authors such as Stephen King, James Patterson and Robert A. Caro. David Maraniss, an associate editor at The Washington Post, has also signed the letter.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Preston, who spoke with Amazon senior vice president of Kindle content Russ Grandinetti over the weekend, said that he wouldn&#39;t feel right taking Amazon&#39;s proposed deal -- even though he estimates doing so would make him millions of dollars.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: justify;">&quot;That would be like blood money,&quot; he said. &quot;I would never turn around and do something like that to them.&quot; Best-selling Hachette author Scott Turow called Amazon&#39;s offer &quot;little more than a publicity stunt.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Turow, a lawyer and former president of the Authors&#39; Guild, said accepting the offer &quot;would be very shortsighted on the part of authors. If they succeeded by this tactic in making Hachette cave, one of the losers would end up being the authors. Amazon is not offering 100 percent in perpetuity.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Turow said that &quot;to some extent the publishers have brought this on themselves by not sharing appropriately with authors. There are much fatter profits on ebooks than on physical ones and that has drawn Amazon like bees to the honey.&quot; But he added that &quot;giving more to Amazon is not the solution.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">He said only best-selling authors have the bargaining power to get better royalties from publishers. &quot;If Amazon really wanted to split authors from the publishers, it would wrap its arms around us and demand higher royalties for authors while not increasing its share of revenues,&quot; Turow said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Update, July 9: In response to Preston&#39;s comments, Amazon said in a statement, &quot;Easy for him to say. He&#39;s rich and already successful. He can opt out of the offer for himself if he wants, but he shouldn&#39;t stand in the way of debut and midlist authors benefiting from the offer.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Staff writer Steven Mufson contributed to this report.

Bezos to protest the web retailer&#39;s tough tactics.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">One letter, spearheaded by author Douglas Preston and signed by nearly 400 authors--including Stephen King, Pulitzer Prize winner Robert A.

For instance, it would leave in place the government&#39;s ability to conduct warrantless searches for Americans&#39; communications in the data gathered by the NSA.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">US Marshals: One Auction Bidder Claimed All 30,000 Silk Road Bitcoins CoinDesk&#39;s Stan Higgins reports that, &quot;The US Marshals Service (USMS) has announced that a single, undisclosed bidder claimed all of the roughly 30,000 bitcoins seized from online black market Silk Road and sold in its recent auction.&quot; According to the U.S. Marshals office statement, the bitcoins have already been transferred to the winner.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The FTC is accusing T-Mobile of jacking up customers&#39; phone bills &quot;According to the FTC, the wireless carrier got kickbacks when other companies offering &#39;flirting tips, horoscope information or celebrity gossip&#39; tried to bill customers for spammy content they didn&#39;t want or didn&#39;t ask for,&quot; The Switch&#39;s Brian Fung reports. &quot;In a statement posted to the company&#39;s Web site, T-Mobile chief executive John Legere called the FTC&#39;s complaint a &#39;sensationalized legal action&#39; that was &#39;unfounded and without merit.&#39;&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">UK regulator investigates Facebook over emotions study &quot;The British data watchdog is investigating whether Facebook Inc violated data-protection laws when it allowed researchers to conduct a psychological experiment on its users,&quot; according to Reuters. &quot;Information Commissioner&#39;s Office (ICO) spokesman Greg Jones said in an email to Reuters that the office is &quot;aware of this issue and will be speaking to Facebook, as well as liaising with the Irish data protection authority, to learn more about the circumstances.&quot; (Facebook&#39;s European headquarters is in Ireland.)

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Everything that has happened on the Internet in the past five years would suggest that daily-deal sites are, conclusively, dead.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Groupon chief executive Andrew Mason was summarily booted from his own company. LivingSocial laid off hundreds of people and watched millions of dollars evaporate.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Even the original daily-deal site, Texas-based Woot, was devoured like so much breakfast octopus by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">And yet — and yet! — Matt Rutledge, the man behind Woot, is back with an ambitious plan to restore daily deals to their former glory. Woot, for ye who missed it, was the quirky, irreverent front-runner to modern daily deals, premised on transparency and randomness (… literally, in some cases, &quot;random bags of crap&quot;). In a Kickstarter that was funded Saturday, Rutledge essentially made his pitch to bring it back.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">There will be no more than one deal a day, he promised. No ads or marketing. And most refreshingly, perhaps, no ambitions to change culture or capitalism or The Way We Shop Now.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Because even if it turns out to be the greatest store on the Internet,&quot; Rutledge writes, &quot;it&#39;s still just a store on the Internet.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">… he is, appropriately, christening the whole thing &quot;Meh.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Since Tuesday, more than a thousand people have bought into Rutledge&#39;s vision … or his nostalgia, or his candor, or some combination of the three. When the Kickstarter closed Saturday morning, the project had raised</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">$14,777 instead of the $10,000 it originally sought. This is particularly incredible when you consider what the site promises to do with those funds — nothing. (If &quot;we end up netting a bunch of money from&quot; Kickstarter, the FAQ reads, &quot;I dunno, maybe we&#39;ll commission some famous rock stars to write our site theme song.&quot; Or something.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">No doubt, people throwing money at a start-up on Kickstarter do, in fact, want that start-up to succeed. But given Meh&#39;s vague implementation, and the fierce loyalty of comments left by several of its backers, the project&#39;s success also looks like a strike for a broader movement: a backlash, if you will, against the super-corporatized, over-marketed and totally invasive culture of modern e-commerce sites.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Specifically, it reads like a reaction against Amazon, which bought and partially dismembered Woot in 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;It made me sad that [Amazon] slowly killed everything that made [Woot] special,&quot; one commenter wrote. &quot;I&#39;m seriously excited to see that you guys are coming out with a true successor.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Compared to an amazon like Amazon, Meh does look scrappy and alternative — a refreshingly human, down-to-earth free-for-all where no one&#39;s trying to sell you junk … or sell you as the product, yourself. The</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">question, of course, is whether that vision can actually compete in the very crowded, very stagnant market of daily deals.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;How come every time something simple gets popular, people want to make it more complicated? And less fun?&quot; Rutledge asks.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maybe he&#39;s forgotten from his pre-windfall days, but there&#39;s usually one big reason: the bills.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140630ea6u002s2</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 1/Image_008.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark88">wonkblog</a><a name="bookmark89">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">The banking industry wants to be just like Amazon</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Danielle Douglas 919 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">28 June 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It started out as mild infatuation, but now it seems bankers have developed a full-blown crush on Amazon.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">From Citigroup to SunTrust, banking industry executives are gushing over the Internet retailer&#39;s use of analytics to figure out what customers want, a model that bankers see as the salvation for an industry being invaded by more nimble retail, tech and telecom competitors.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Just like Amazon, banks collect vast amounts of information about their clients. Your bank knows what you buy, how much you spend and whether you have anything saved. That kind of intel could be used to anticipate whether you need a credit card, car loan or investments.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">It&#39;s one thing to simply offer a car loan, Thong Nguyen, the head of retail banking at Bank of America, said at a press breakfast in Manhattan Thursday. &quot;It&#39;s more interesting to see that you are on month 33 of your car loan payments...and then present you the opportunity to get a cheaper rate,&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Consumers--whether they are buying a Kindle or opening a checking account--want companies to make products relevant to their individual needs, Nguyen said. There is something to be said for getting an email of feminist reading suggestions from Amazon, after you&#39;ve finished a Bell Hooks book on your Kindle.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The banking industry is betting that the same sort of tailor-made approach could work for mortgages and credit cards too. The trick will be to do it without appearing creepy or intrusive.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re chasing after the Amazon experience,&quot; Nguyen said. &quot;Amazon keeps moving to improve customer service. And we&#39;re going to invest more&quot; to replicate that kind of service.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Nguyen said for banks to be successful at data-driven customer service, they would need to drill down into each client profile. The financial needs of a 28 year-old customer making $100,000 a year is not the same as a 63 year old with the same salary. Sure, they&#39;re both prime candidates for investment products, but would require a different mix of stocks and bonds. Or they may need different types of home loans.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;The things that we offer you won&#39;t change--credit cards, home loans, investments and what not--the way I engage you, make it relevant for you will,&quot; Nguyen said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">This sort of individualized approach runs counter to the traditional banking model that relies heavily on a high volume of transactions. Who has the time to figure out what each customer needs when dealing with millions of accounts? But the entrance of Google, Wal-Mart and even Amazon into the payments space is putting pressure on banks to find new ways to reach and keep customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Yet if banks use customer data solely for the purpose of selling more products, they may miss an opportunity to develop meaningful relationships, said Jennifer Tescher, president and chief executive of the Center for Financial Services Innovation.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Banks could make a huge impact by using data to help consumers optimize their cash flow in real time,&quot; she said. &quot;Using data to predict a life event that&#39;s going to require a high-margin banking product is not the place to start.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">She noted that PNC Bank and KeyBank track their customers&#39; transactions and create a financial calendar that lists when bills are due or money scheduled for deposit, helping people manage their finances.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Technology should enable us to solve the problem of having to juggle your inflows and outflows, particularly when the timing and the amount of money you have varies dramatically from month to month,&quot; Tescher said. &quot;If banks are able to do that, it would be an incredible value to customers.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It could also help to ease some of the consumer anxiety surrounding mobile banking. The platform is catching on, especially among folks under the age of 35, but a good segment of the population remain distrustful of conducting financial transactions through their smartphones.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">A recent study by the National Council of La Raza and the Urban League found that nearly a third of the 5,000 people they surveyed were concerned about security controls. Banks and credit unions actually have tougher regulatory standards to guard consumer data than merchants do because of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999. That bit of information, coupled with the promotion of basic money management, could draw even more people to mobile.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Nguyen said smartphones are the next frontier. Building out intuitive digital platforms, with the ability to send spending or bill pay alerts, could give customers the same sort of user-friendly experience that has made companies like Amazon popular.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">About 15 million Bank of America customers use their smartphones to transfer money or deposit checks, a number that Nguyen said has been growing at 20 percent a year. By comparison, the number of customers that bank online--roughly 30 million--has hit a plateau.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">As a result, Nguyen said Bank of America is investing in its mobile platform, with an aim of someday moving into mobile payments, whereby a merchant can scan a customer&#39;s smartphone to collect a payment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;The next frontier is the payment technology,&quot; Nguyen said. &quot; We&#39;re going to be working with people who make phones, with people like Google, eBay and Paypal and see where it goes from there. The whole payment system is going to evolve.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Apple has a new smartwatch coming in the fall and Amazon has a new Fire smartphone coming in July. That should be good news for consumer technology fans, but the reality is that both products are &quot;me-too&quot; plays that should be setting off all kinds of warning bells for Silicon Valley watchers. Instead of launching truly innovative new products and opening up entirely new markets, the best and brightest companies are seemingly content to make a more conservative play for market share and rely on incremental innovations to win over customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Take the Apple &quot;iWatch,&quot; for example. Even die-hard Apple fans would have to admit that the iWatch sounds like a &quot;me-too&quot; tech play that has the company struggling to catch up with the likes of Samsung. It&#39;s almost like Apple is unwillingly being pulled into creating an iWatch just because its top tech rivals also have a smartwatch. True, there&#39;s an opportunity to create a market-changing digital fitness product using the iWatch — but smartwatches have had trouble gaining any traction to date.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Or, for example, consider the new Amazon Fire phone. Do we really need another smartphone that helps us buy more products? Amazon&#39;s decision to roll out a new smartphone when the entire smartphone industry is nearing its saturation point seems a lot like a lot of reactive strategy. In short, a big company reacts to what&#39;s going on around it rather than really mapping out a strategy for the future. Yes, there are some features that sound innovative — but the bigger picture is that an Amazon smartphone sounds a lot like a Facebook smartphone, and we all know how that did.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not that there aren&#39;t some big ideas out there in Silicon Valley.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">You have Google launching Internet balloons, building a fleet of driverless cars and developing quantum computers. But, oh, by the way, Google&#39;s Nest plans to acquire Dropcam for more than half a billion dollars. A company that promises to change the world ends up buying a webcam company.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon wowed the world with its delivery drones last year, but followed that up with tepid adventures in innovation such as Fire TV and the Fire phone. No word yet if the Fire smartwatch is next.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Facebook has its share of innovative concepts in the works — like a plan to use satellite drones to provide Internet access to the world — but on a day-to-day basis, Facebook seems more interested in carrying out little tweaks to its algorithms. Meanwhile the company rolls out ever more apps that seem like &quot;me-too&quot; plays in an effort to keep up with innovators around it. The latest is Slingshot, which sounds a lot like Snapchat.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Apple has a futuristic new headquarters in the works and a vision to change the way we think about digital health. But it follows that up with the so-called iWatch — a smartwatch that reportedly comes in a variety of screen sizes and colors along with sensors for tracking health.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The problem, quite simply, is that the recent moves by the likes of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google actually make too much sense. From a purely business and analytical perspective, the moves are designed to maximize market share, increase user engagement, and hit any of the various other metrics designed to measure their performance. Wall Street analysts, even if they&#39;re not in love with the moves, have to respect them. If the Amazon Fire phone succeeds in signing more people up for Amazon Prime and selling an incremental number of products on Amazon, does it really matter that the phone never acquires the market cachet of an iPhone?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Follow the arc of the rise and fall of any industry leader, however, and that&#39;s exactly how smaller companies with inferior technologies begin to chip away at the market leaders. As Clayton Christensen has pointed out in The Innovator&#39;s Dilemma — still one of the classic innovation reads — what makes true innovation so hard is that the</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">business case for &quot;business as usual&quot; just makes so much sense once you&#39;re the market leader. It becomes a matter of continual improvements and tweaks to &quot;what works,&quot; while ceding the ground to upstarts when it comes to new technologies.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">So here&#39;s why the infatuation with the latest product du jour is so dangerous — in the pursuit of incremental gains to quarterly financial numbers, America&#39;s most innovative companies risk ceding more and more ground to upstarts who are coming up with disruptive products. It almost seems impossible to think of a company more innovative than Google or Apple these days — but the same was once surely true of great American companies such as IBM or Kodak. When the best and brightest in Silicon Valley are buying the likes of Nest or Beats, one wonders if they are doing so because they are one step ahead of the curve — or one step behind.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

Now they have a vision, they have a plan,&quot; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The symposium drew more executives this year compared to past years, she said — a sign that the people responsible for organizations&#39; missions are now eager to learn about cloud applications, instead of just developers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In March, the company secured an authority to operate certain cloud services with the Defense Department. AWS secured FedRAMP certification — a federal security requirement— since May of 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite growing cloud adoption, there&#39;s still work to be done, she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re far from done,&quot; she said. &quot;There&#39;s still agencies [that] don&#39;t have all [the] steps in place, so we&#39;re still working with agencies and a lot of countries around the world&quot; to help them understand how to acquire cloud services.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">To speed adoption, AWS spends plenty of time on Capitol Hill educating lawmakers about the cost-saving potential of cloud services, Carlson said — especially as compared to traditional data storage. The company has been marketing its services not only to federal governments for their internal use, but more recently, to state and local governments that might use Amazon&#39;s cloud services to build applications that would help them connect with citizens, she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We also spend time on compliance and the security regime with compliance officers within those agencies,&quot; Carlson added.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The federal government is also adapting to the culture of cloud computing — especially the rapid process of so-called agile software development, where product improvements are made incrementally.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;I think people are beginning to realize that on AWS you can try and fail fast without it affecting your system in a big way. Try things out in a testing and developing environment before you start deploying completely, and that&#39;s really another benefit of true commercial cloud computing, is their ability to try these architectures out and fail really fast, and cheap, without having it really affect their application that&#39;s up and running.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:mohana.ravindranath@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">(Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Google will debut &quot;at least one&quot; new television set-top box and compatible software on Wednesday when its developer conference kicks off in San Francisco, according to several news outlets.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The box will allow users to view content, listen to music and play games on their TV sets, according to stories in the Wall Street Journal and CNET.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The search engine giant is in a race with Amazon, Apple and others to lure users with devices that favor their content and services. In Google&#39;s case, such devices also multiply the company&#39;s opportunities to run targeted ads, its primary revenue stream. (Disclosure: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">According to the Journal, the device itself is made by another company but uses Google&#39;s new Android TV software designed to play movies, games and other content on televisions. Users will be able to use Android phones, tablets and potentially other devices as remote controls.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">A key feature of Android TV will be videogames that work seamlessly between mobile devices and TV, a developer briefed on Google&#39;s plans told the Journal. That means users could play a game on the bus on the way to work, then pick up where they left off on their Android-powered TV when they get home. Another source said a split-screen multiplayer game is in development.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">According to CNET, at least one Google device unveiled on Wednesday will have a Nvidia Tegra 4 processor, with other boxes using Intel processors in the works. The Tegra 4 is the same chip used in Nvidia&#39;s Shield, an Android-based handheld video game released last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Google TV has been available through devices made by LG, Netgear, Vizio and other companies since 2010, but many Android partners use their own software to power the devices. The company&#39;s previous forays into the TV market have flopped. Former partner Logitech called its 2010 Google TV project &quot;a mistake of implementation of a gigantic nature.&quot; Google also introduced a media streaming player, Nexus Q, at its 2012 I/O conference, but shelved the project after receiving poor feedback.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">However, Google has been successful with Chromecast. At $35, the dongle is cheaper than a set-top box and lets users stream Internet video through phones, tablets and computers running Google&#39;s Chrome browser.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Market research suggests it&#39;s worth Google&#39;s while to keep trying for success in the TV market. A market researcher with Parks Associates told CNET that, while TV sales are down, sales of devices that plug into televisions and play video and music are expected to jump to 330 million units by 2017, double the total from last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Almost a year after awarding a cloud computing contract to Amazon Web Services, Central Intelligence Agency chief information officer Doug Wolfe on Tuesday said the agency is still adapting to working with the private sector on IT projects.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Wolfe described a &quot;pretty interesting clash of cultures&quot; between the public and private sectors, addressing attendees Amazon Web Services&#39; annual nonprofit and government symposium at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">For instance, the CIA is subjecting AWS&#39; cloud product to the agency&#39;s stringent cybersecurity requirements before its scheduled deployment in the summer, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;ve had some interesting conversations and debates on security,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;We&#39;re working through that. And I think that we&#39;re going to end up in a very good quality product, and a very secure product.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The agency is also learning to procure IT services more efficiently when working with the private sector, Wolfe said. Amazon is charging on a cost-recovery basis, meaning the agency will only pay for the cloud products and services they use.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;If you&#39;re a government customer who has been used to just ordering up however much IT you want, and over-ordering typically — which people do, they often order for their peak need — if you&#39;re a government customer used to doing that, you&#39;re going to start getting a bill. You&#39;re going to start seeing exactly what your</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">consumption cost, and start understanding exactly how server storage processing, et cetera, was applied to the problem. So we see this as a tremendous opportunity to sharpen our focus and be very efficient.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The agency is still looking for ways to &quot;take the best of the private sector, lift it, and . . . be able to operate that for the intelligence community,&quot; Wolfe said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:mohana.ravindranath@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">(Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">T-Mobile threw another one of its flashy &quot;Uncarrier&quot; events again Wednesday night, announcing that it will not charge its customers for data they use when listening to streaming music from some of the industry&#39;s top services.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The news came just hours after Amazon.com announced that its first smartphone, the Fire phone, would offer free integration with Amazon&#39;s own Prime Music service and Prime Video. Both add more fuel to a trend we&#39;ve seen coming for a while: The future of entertainment is in the bundle.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Smartphone users have long used their phones more for data consumption than for actual phone calls. And music streaming over mobile phones is on the rise, up 32 percent in the last year across all devices. Ericsson reported that, by traffic volume, music services rank about in line with e-mail on most smartphones.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Since Apple first paired its iTunes service with its music players and phones, device makers have been looking at ways to use entertainment services to sell devices (or vice versa, in Amazon&#39;s case). Music industry analyst Mark Mulligan wrote Thursday that he believes the bundling model is the best strategy for Apple as the company evaluates what to do with its recent acquisition of Beats Music. But Amazon is now the company to watch, Mulligan said, to see how well the model works in today&#39;s streaming landscape.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">&quot;[All] eyes will be on Amazon to see if the model is finally ready for prime time (pun sort of intended) now that it has been sneaked in through the back door,&quot; he wrote.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">With its latest announcement, T-Mobile has gone even further, by making music essentially a part of its data plan. Under the new program, any data charges customers would have picked up by streaming Pandora, Spotify, Rhapsody, iHeartRadio, iTunes Radio, Slacker, Samsung&#39;s Milk streaming services are excused. T-Mobile will also extend the same deal to the upcoming Beatport app. The company said that, between those eight services, it believes it has covered over 80 percent of the streaming music market. But it&#39;s taking suggestions from its customers on other services to add to its list.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In an interview with The Washington Post, Gabriel Torres, T-Mobile&#39;s vice president for the southeast region, said that the carrier may be open to adding other kinds of services in the future. Video, for example, makes up around 30 percent of all traffic on mobile phones, and subsidizing that data would save customers a lot of money. But the company has no definite plans at this time, Torres said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">As all of this entertainment comes to the smartphone -- and data consumption rises as a result -- it&#39;s not hard to imagine that more firms will follow T-Mobile&#39;s lead to lure customers. But the carrier is already fielding questions about whether its deal violates the principles of net neutrality -- the idea that there should be no preferential treatment in the flow of data on the Internet -- because this deal could be interpreted as a way to unfairly prop up those particular music services.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The company has soundly rejected that argument. &quot;With all of these companies that we are working with, we don&#39;t have specific arrangements with them,&quot; said Torres. &quot;We&#39;re taking those streaming feeds and excluding them from the high-speed data bucket for customers. We&#39;re not paying for the subscription.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document WPCOM00020140619ea6j0076f</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark100">the-switch</a><a name="bookmark101">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon unveils its smartphone.

All Rights Reserved. Forget point-and-shoot. This is point-and-shop.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon.com announced that it&#39;s officially getting into the smartphone market Wednesday, releasing the Fire Phone -- a clear play to get more users for its $99 per year Amazon Prime membership. The 4.7-inch phone, which starts at $199.99 and comes with a free year of the premium shopping service, makes it easier than ever for people to shop via Amazon. The phone, which will be offered exclusively through AT&amp;T, has a button on the side that will immediately recognize products that users scan, listen to or watch, and then send them directly to Amazon.com to buy it.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Fire Phone puts everything you love about Amazon in the palm of your hand,&quot; Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos said in a company press release.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But there&#39;s one big problem for Amazon: It&#39;s not a great time to get into the smartphone market right now, particularly in the United States where the interest in new smartphones is flat.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Nearly everyone who might want a smartphone in this countryprobably has one, and once customers get into a certain smartphone maker&#39;s orbit, they tend to stay there. There&#39;s a reason that Apple and Samsung command nearly 50 percent of the world&#39;s smartphone market between them -- and nearly all of the profits -- leaving all other companies to pick at the scraps.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s a nasty business,&quot; said Carl Howe, an analyst for the Yankee Group. &quot;At best they&#39;ll break even, and you need a lot of sales of other stuff at single-digit margins.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So will this be worth it for Amazon?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">If there&#39;s one thing that Amazon isn&#39;t short on, it&#39;s ambition. Amazon&#39;s main innovations in the consumer electronics space have been focused on bundling things together to provide a one-stop shop -- the &quot;Store for Everything&quot; model. Having a smartphone in the mix opens up new worlds of potential for the company to expand its empire.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">With its Prime service, Amazon&#39;s proven that the bundle is a model worth chasing. A note from RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney ahead of the announcement noted that Prime consumers spend twice as much as non-Prime customers on Amazon; even owning a Kindle means that you&#39;re likely to spend 30 percent more than the average customer.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">A smartphone gives Amazon perhaps the most direct path to the consumer yet, given that people spend an estimated 22 hours of each day within reach of their smartphone. The tech giant has already laid track in the mobile payments space, announcing earlier this month that it was partnering with sites and stores around the Web to let online shoppers pay for things using the credit card information already store on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It also gives the company a way to break out even further from the online shopping world into the land of brick-and-mortar stores -- putting it on the cusp of what many say is the next major hurdle for retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Strategically, if you look at the cellphone, it can be the first real personal shopping assistant attuned and tailored to you,&quot; said Thom Blischok, chief retail strategist for the consultancy firm Strategy&amp;.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Down the line, Blischokbelieves that mobile devices will become the primary portal for personal shopping. And, he said, Amazon is the unique position to provide particularly good recommendations. &quot;I would expect Amazon would have a strong ability to tie past preferences with current trends&quot; to provide good suggestions, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It will also let users recognize images and words, so that users can, for example, call a business by simply scanning the phone number they see on a sign. It sports a 13 megapixel camera, a speedy processor and sensors that are able to track where users&#39; heads and eyes are at all times. That means that the phone&#39;s display changes based on your viewing angle.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">These are some new ideas, but perhaps not enough to convince users to switch to the Fire, said Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;m a little skeptical that what they&#39;re bringing to the table is enough to make people put down their current phone and change to a new device,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Nguyen said that this does make it seem like the company&#39;s upping its game on making good gadgets. But it&#39;s not a main focus of the company in the way that it is for Samsung or, certainly, Apple. Amazon&#39;s hardware, historically, just hasn&#39;t been very good at launch -- something that Bezos addressed in his speech. Because the company has its roots as an online bookstore and retailer, it&#39;s more focused on the perfect consumer experience than the slickest looking product.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The entrance into a new market also raises questions, analysts said, about whether the company is getting any closer to making money. Wall Street and Amazon investors have given the company a lot of leeway on not delivering profits in the past, but many are growing frustrated with its razor-thin margins. Adding yet another business, particularly one as difficult as telecommunications, doesn&#39;t improve the picture.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Do we really believe they can be all things in all businesses?

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Online retail giant Amazon is set to unveil a new piece of hardware at an event in Seattle on Wednesday.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The company is widely expected to reveal a smartphone that will give it yet another avenue to appeal directly to consumers. Despite months of apparent leaks, rumors and innuendo, the details are still pretty hazy. But here&#39;s what we think we know. (Disclosure: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It is a smartphone. Rumors of an Amazon smartphone have swirled for years, so everyone is assuming this new hardware is a phone based on the promotional material Amazon has released so far. BGR, which has a pretty strong track record of coming through when it comes to Amazon leaks, even claimed to have photos of a prototype device.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">There are some pretty compelling reasons that Amazon would want to break into the mobile phone business. While the company got its start selling physical books and grew to sell almost any item in the world</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">through a single Web site, Amazon has increasingly invested in digital services, from cloud computing to e-books and online video rentals. Its forays into the hardware space, including the Kindle line and FireTV, serve as direct portals between consumers and Amazon&#39;s online marketplace. But without a smartphone, it is missing out on chances to sell to customers when they&#39;re on the move.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s still technically possible that the Amazon hardware announcement scheduled for today is something else entirely. But basically every tech journalist out there is going to feel like a huge idiot if the company reveals it is releasing a game controller for FireTV or some other contraption.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s a 3D smartphone with a gazillion cameras. Along with the apparently leaked photos in April, BGR reported sources claiming the rumored phone had a total of six cameras -- some of which enables a glasses-less 3-D experience. Presumably, that 3-D effect and rumored tilt controls could be why people are moving their heads and freaking out in this Amazon-released promo video:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">According to TechCrunch, the technology behind this anticipated feature comes from Japanese</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">company Omron&#39;s Okao Vision face sensing system, which it reports has been modified by developers in-house at Amazon. The software pack associated with the Okao Vision system &quot;can also recognize faces and facial attributes to estimate a person&#39;s gender, age and ethnicity&quot; per TechCrunch, but the outlet did not believe Amazon was planning to roll out these features in its initial smartphone.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">An AT&amp;T exclusive? The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the device would be exclusive to AT&amp;T customers at its initial launch -- much to the chagrin of T-Mobile CEO John Legere. This isn&#39;t too much of a stretch: Amazon already uses AT&amp;T for data plans for its Kindle e-readers and tablets. Plus, AT&amp;T has a history making exclusive deals. While the HTC First &quot;Facebook phone&quot; flopped, AT&amp;T did pretty well as the exclusive carrier of Apple&#39;s iPhone for its first few years on the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The killer app could be &quot;Prime Data.&quot; According to an April report from BGR, the smartphone will come with a &quot;unique wireless data plan,&quot; tentatively called &quot;Prime Data.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Prime&quot; here likely refers to the Amazon membership program, which initially just offered free two-day shipping on many items for an annual flat rate, but has since added new features over the years, including streaming video and a lending library of e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Another hint for what &quot;Prime Data&quot; could be: In January, AT&amp;T announced a &quot;sponsored data&quot; service in which certain data charges from consumers could be billed to a sponsoring company -- similar to how calls to a 1-800 number works.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It doesn&#39;t seem too crazy to imagine that Amazon would seek to tie the benefits of Prime and AT&amp;T&#39;s sponsored data to its entry into the smartphone market. If &quot;Prime Data&quot; is a deal with AT&amp;T to exclude Amazon content from mobile data caps, that might be a powerful incentive to get users interested in the hardware -- and interested in buying Amazon content. Plus, it might explain why Amazon would agree to limit its device&#39;s potential audience to one carrier at launch.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140618ea6i003ux</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark104">The Fire phone is Amazon&#39;s latest broadside against brick-and-mortar retailers ; If the device takes off, it will encourage more of the showrooming that physical retailers hate so much.</a><a name="bookmark105">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Brian Fung 359 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">18 June 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

(Mike Kane/Bloomberg)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">If there&#39;s one standout feature of Amazon&#39;s new Fire phone, it&#39;s the Shazam for everything. The phone can recognize not just music and QR codes, but also movies, TV shows, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and oh, yeah — all the millions of products that Amazon sells from its Web site.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">(If you, like many of us, thought the killer feature was going to be some kind of 3D holographic awesomeness, stand down. The Fire phone has some 3D capabilities — for instance, you&#39;ll be able to physically look around digital corners in video games — but the holograms will have to come later.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If the device takes off — which is still a big if — it could be bad news for brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Whether or not Amazon will acknowledge it, one big idea behind the device is to make it easier than ever to go &quot;showrooming&quot;: Visit a store in person, identify and test the product you want, and then buy it with a click on your phone from Amazon instead of from the store you&#39;re standing in. This may not be a big deal right now, as</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">ommerce still accounts for a tiny sliver of retail sales overall.</p></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">E-commerce - Share of Retail Sales</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Charts from the NRF Foundation&#39;s Retail Insight Center.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The phone is a 4.7 inch device that plugs directly into Amazon&#39;s Prime Video, Prime Music and cloud storage services. It also is closely integrated with the company&#39;s Kindle reading apps and Audible audiobooks services.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The phone has a quad-core 2.2 Ghz processor, 2 GB of ram and a screen meant to reduce the amount of glare from sunlight. It also sports a 13 MP camera, has advanced image-stablization software, and includes unlimited photo storage through Amazon&#39;s Cloud Drive service. The company also introduced &quot;tangle-proof&quot; earbuds, according to a report from Re/Code. The phone can also be used to scan products in stores, so that consumers can buy directly from Amazon using a new service called &quot;Firefly.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">There have been rumors for years that Amazon was looking at jumping into the smartphone market. The anticipation wasn&#39;t lost on Amazon. The company invited all of its customers to attend the launch event in Seattle</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">-- 60,000 of which applied and 300 of which made it in. (It also sent a rather enigmatic gift to reporters covering the event: a copy of chief executive Jeff Bezos&#39;s favorite childhood book, &quot;Mr. Pine&#39;s Purple House,&quot; which focused on the importance of standing out from the crowd.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The tech giant has already released a line of tablets to accompany its Kindle e-readers, and even tried its hand at a set-top box. And its growing suite of entertainment options, marked most recently by the release of a streaming music service for its most loyal customers, can make its devices more appealing.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">But smartphones are a whole different animal. While the markets for other consumer electronics are more fluid, the smartphone industry is more or less dominated by Apple and Samsung, which control around 50 percent of the world&#39;s smartphone market between them.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;The most important thing we&#39;ve done is to earn trust with customers,&quot; Bezos said, according to a report from Mashable.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">(Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P.

So like, the whole time it was available on @att..</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Legere, who spent nearly 20 years of his career working his way up the ranks at AT&amp;T, has cultivated a rebellious image since taking the top executive slot at T-Mobile USA in September 2012. The CEO forsakes suit and tie for  a trademark pink T-Mobile T-shirt underneath a blazer or leather jacket, and he seems to relish creating outrageous headlines. For instance, last year he crashed (and was kicked out of) AT&amp;T&#39;s CES developer party -- reportedly out of a desire to watch Macklemore and Ryan Lewis perform.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But Legere&#39;s personal antics are also mirrored by some of the aggressive growth tactics the company has introduced during his tenure under the &quot;uncarrier&quot; banner -- including doing away with service contracts and phone subsidies, offering free international data roaming, and offering to pay early termination fees for customers switching to the carrier.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The campaign has resulted in customer gains, but the company hasn&#39;t yet seen that growth reflected in its revenue. So T-Mobile remains a bit of a scrappy underdog -- a fourth place finisher battling to tempt customers away from the competition, while rumors swirl about an acquisition by third-place Sprint.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, AT&amp;T remains the second largest mobile carrier in the United States -- and no stranger to Amazon or exclusive arrangements. AT&amp;T currently provides wireless service to the online retailer&#39;s Kindle tablets and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">e-readers. In addition to the Facebook phone fiasco, AT&amp;T was the exclusive carrier of Apple&#39;s iPhone for its first few years on the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Obviously, if the rumored Amazon smartphone is successful, being cut out of the deal could be bad news for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">T-Mobile. But Legere might also be worried that an Amazon exclusive partnership with AT&amp;T will overshadow the company&#39;s own &quot;uncarrier&quot; announcement scheduled for Wednesday. T-Mobile already relocated its event from Los Angeles to Seattle so technology journalists would not have to choose between it and Amazon&#39;s hardware announcement.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">(Correction: An earlier version of this story described erroneously AT&amp;T as the largest wireless carrier in the U.S. It is the second largest after Verizon.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140617ea6h0089b</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 1/Image_011.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark110">act-four</a><a name="bookmark111">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">How to think about Amazon&#39;s fight with Hachette over book pricing ; How to think about Amazon&#39;s fight</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with Hachette over book pricing</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Alyssa Rosenberg 676 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">17 June 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

Amazon has issued a statement defending its business practices but declined to talk to reporters about the charges.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In the conflict between these two large companies, Hachette wants the public to believe that publishers, authors and readers are all on the same side against the retail giant. That is not necessarily the case.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Author Hugh Howey, who published his &quot;Wool&quot; series through Amazon&#39;s Kindle Direct Publishing</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">program, recently raised sharp questions about Hachette&#39;s interests in its dispute with Amazon. Just because Hachette wants to charge more for the e-books it publishes, he argues, does not mean those prices are pegged to production costs or that authors would share in those higher prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Publishers are waging a war here for higher prices and lower royalties,&quot; Howey wrote. &quot;$14.99 is their ideal price for an e-book that costs nothing to print, warehouse, or ship. That&#39;s twice what mass market paperbacks used to cost, which is what they are replacing. Reminds you of how cheaper-to-produce CDs suddenly cost twice as much as cassettes simply because they were new, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Amazon&#39;s tactics in its feud with Hachette and now Time Warner, including delaying shipping on Hachette books and refusing to take pre-orders for &quot;The Lego Movie,&quot; are certainly annoying if you badly want a physical copy of a book or a movie. But they are short-term tools that Amazon is using to drive down prices for consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Hachette and Time Warner may be angry about Amazon&#39;s toughness and power to influence the market. But that does not mean that Amazon is ignoring its customers&#39; long-term best interests. Hachette, after all, is one of three publishers who settled a price-fixing suit brought by the Justice Department in 2012: Those companies ended up paying $69 million to readers who purchased their e-books over a two-year period.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That Hachette would try to ratchet up prices is understandable. But that does not make the effort admirable or a service to customers or authors.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Of course, just because Hachette is self-interested does not make Amazon a paragon of ethical business either. As Amazon has become a major player in the clothing and shoe retail, how has its market share impacted garment workers who produce the products it sells in such great volume? We might joke about Bezos&#39;s idea for Amazon to do delivery by drone, but Amazon&#39;s commitment to exceptionally fast delivery is a serious business with serious implications: The Labor Department is investigating two deaths in Amazon warehouses. Journalists have been calling attention to the conditions in those facilities for years.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">I am all for an ethical conversation about Amazon&#39;s role in the American economy and marketplace. But in that discussion, we should not confuse the interests of big media companies with the interests of the people who work for them and the people who buy their products.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140617ea6h00565</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 1/Image_012.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark112">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark113">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Free music for members of Prime Lower fuel economy ratings for Ford cars</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">1,070 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">13 June 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">FINAL A15</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

The main one is that while Amazon&#39;s new service does include songs from top artists such as Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars, Blake Shelton and Madonna, the online retail giant hasn&#39;t struck deals with all the major music labels.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">So, the odds are that you&#39;ll quickly find that some song you want to listen to - like any original Beatles song - isn&#39;t available on the free service. Missing, too, are the hits of the moment. BuzzFeed reported that Amazon won&#39;t get access to songs until the tunes have been out for six months.

It was the second time Ford has cut fuel ratings for the C-Max hybrid in less than a year.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We apologize to our customers and will provide goodwill payments to affected owners,&quot; Alan Mulally, Ford&#39;s chief executive, said in a statement. &quot;We also are taking steps to improve our processes and prevent issues like this from happening again.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The restatement of mileage estimates is nothing new in the auto industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Last August, Ford - which has touted its superior fuel efficiency in the past - cut the ratings for the C-Max hybrid by up to 7 mpg after complaints from consumers and experts that the model&#39;s actual mileage fell short of the company&#39;s claims.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In 2012, an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency showed that Hyundai Motor Co. and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. overstated fuel economy by at least a mile per gallon.

Other affected models include four versions of the Fiesta, the hybrid and Energi versions of the Fusion, and the C-Max hybrid and Energi.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">l U.S. retail sales rose less than expected in May and first-time applications for jobless benefits increased last week, but the data did little to alter perceptions that the economy is regaining steam. The Commerce Department said Thursday that retail sales gained 0.3 percent. While that was below the 0.6 percent rise expected on Wall Street, April sales were revised higher to show a 0.5 percent increase, helping to keep growth forecasts intact. In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 317,000 for the week ended June 7. Despite the rise, claims are not too far from their</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">pre-recession lows, and job growth continues at a steady clip.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">l Lululemon Athletica Inc. slumped to the lowest level in three years after the yogawear retailer cut its full-year earnings forecast. The shares plunged 16 percent to $37.25 at the close of trading Thursday, the lowest since March 2011. The company has been seeking to address supply-chain issues and quality checks that slowed deliveries, and also has been trying to regain shoppers&#39; trust after it recalled its popular line of black Luon yoga pants for being too sheer.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">l A former BP senior engineer found guilty last year of destroying evidence related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill was granted a new trial based on his claim of juror misconduct during deliberations. Kurt Mix was convicted by a federal jury in December of one of two counts of obstruction of justice. Prosecutors said Mix deleted from his mobile phone text messages and voice mails related to BP&#39;s effort to estimate the size of what turned out to be largest U.S. offshore oil spill. The Justice Department declined to comment on the ruling.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">l Many federal workers and contractors who earn the minimum wage are getting a raise next year. Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez has issued a rule to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10. The higher level applies to new federal construction and service contracts beginning Jan. 1.

But that&#39;s probably not Amazon&#39;s immediate goal. The company has shown in the past that it&#39;s happy to release small services that sweeten the deal for Prime customers and grow them over time.

The company is widely expected to release a phone at that time -- offering some sort of music and phone bundle could make the rumored device more attractive to consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Weeks after we learned that Amazon.com stopped taking preorders for books published by Hachette, the online retailer has now put the kibosh on advance orders for coming Warner Home Video products like &quot;The Lego Movie.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The move pits Amazon against a different content industry, but the underlying business logic is the same: Amazon wants to pay the supplier less for products, and the supplier wants Amazon to pay more. This kind of negotiation happens all the time, but Amazon&#39;s talks are drawing attention because of the dominant role it plays in getting us the stuff we buy.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Disclaimer: Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon says its hardball tactics are meant to secure a better deal for you and me. Others are calling Amazon a bully for punishing content providers simply for trying to get fairly compensated.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re having trouble picking a side, don&#39;t feel bad. This is a complicated issue.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">On the face of it, Amazon appears to be using its substantial leverage as a seller to extract huge concessions from suppliers. Let&#39;s just take the book publishing industry. Amazon effectively gets a 53 percent discount on all Random House titles. Kindle e-books account for a fifth of the entire U.S. book market, and within the e-book sector specifically, Amazon enjoys a two-thirds lock. If you&#39;re a publisher, you can&#39;t not sell on Amazon. Amazon knows this, and has an incentive to demand that publishers bend over backwards to accommodate the company.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That said, Amazon has also vastly expanded the overall market for books more generally. The novelist Barry Eisler defended the company earlier this month, arguing that Amazon has empowered legions of self-published authors. Small publishers who previously had trouble competing against the so-called Big Five report having benefited from the more level playing field that the Amazon platform provides.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Publishers themselves aren&#39;t exactly put-upon or defenseless, either. Consumers have long complained about the power of academic publishers to increase textbook prices, for instance. Literary agents have called out publishers for giving authors a raw deal. And most recently, in a controversial court case involving Apple, publishers were found to have acted like a cartel in trying to raise margins on e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Of course, the publishers might say this whole sticky court case could&#39;ve been avoided if only Amazon hadn&#39;t tried to sell e-books at such a low price. And the online retailer&#39;s habit of selling e-books below cost as a way to encourage Kindle adoption certainly fits into a much longer narrative about its stormy relationship with publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Unfortunately, none of this helps consumers who just want somebody to take their money.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">There&#39;s a new online shopping site in town that hopes to take on likes of Etsy, eBay and Amazon on their own turf.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The name is &quot;11 Main.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s being launched in beta by the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, according to a press release from 11 Main.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Alibaba is bigger than eBay and Amazon combined and dominates e-commerce in China. Its first foray into U.S.-based online sales comes at it prepares for its U.S. initial public offering, which may come as soon as August and is expected to be one of the largest IPOs in history.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The &quot;invitation-only&quot; site will host more than 1,000 upscale specialty shops and boutiques that sell clothing, accessories, interior goods, arts and crafts — and it plans to keep adding more. The site aims to create an online experience that resembles your local &quot;Main Street&quot; shopping experience.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The new site appears tailored to American tastes with a clean look and modern layout. 11 Main says sellers and their products will be subject to review by the site — perhaps an effort to combat the bad reputation of Taobao, Alibaba&#39;s version of Amazon that is rife with counterfeit goods. There are guidelines for product quality, customer service, photography and even background choice. (Amazon&#39;s founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Forrester analyst Sucharita Mulpuru told the AP she believes Alibaba won&#39;t find it easy to break into the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">already-crowded online shopping industry. &quot;U.S. e-commerce is crowded and relies on high marketing expenses to rise above the clutter,&quot; she said. &quot;The hope is high. We&#39;ll see if they live up to expectations.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But 11 Main thinks they can offer merchants something existing sites don&#39;t. &quot;There are many small shop owners that are looking for broader platforms, but when they look at the broader platforms, those are not necessarily structured to support their brands or their identities,&quot; Mike Effle, president and general manager of 11 Main, told the Wall Street Journal.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">E-commerce is indeed crowded, but boutique e-commerce — Etsy, for example — is a niche that has fewer major players, most of which aren&#39;t familiar to the masses. Sellers may opt for sites such as eBay or Amazon, which more people know, but in doing so they compromise the ability to personalize their retail space.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Susan Berry, who sells her Oshun Spirit brand of natural skin care and beauty products, has already joined 11 Main. &quot;I&#39;m always looking for alternatives to eBay,&quot; she told the Journal. Berry has sold on eBay since 2001, but worries about relying too heavily on one site.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">11 Main promises brands creative control over their space on the site — and the ability to personalize it with photo and video, unlike the generic listings of major e-commerce sites such as Amazon, eBay and even Etsy, a site for sellers of vintage and handmade goods.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And with Alibaba behind it, the site has access to tons of money for marketing.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">An 11 Main spokesman told the Journal the company has a &quot;robust marketing plan&quot; to support the growth of the shops featured on the new site, but declined to share specific plans or how much it plans to spend on advertising.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That was part of 11 Main&#39;s appeal for Tiger Bachler, one of the site&#39;s beta vendors who owns Alys Grace, a small chain of upscale clothing stores in California&#39;s Bay Area. &quot;We&#39;ve been struggling with the ability to reach a large</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">audience being a small business,&quot; she told the AP. &quot;We anticipate [11 Main] will be able to give us a wider audience with their marketplace expertise and marketing power.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Cost is part of the site&#39;s appeal. Brands will pay a 3.5 percent commission, the same that Etsy charges. But that is half what most other major U.S. shopping sites charge, according to the Journal.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The buzz is building around the mysterious gadget that Amazon.com is showcasing in a public event this month, with the general consensus being that the tech giant is about to launch a phone that can project or at least display 3D images.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The idea that Amazon might launch a phone that has some sort of 3D capability is actually one that surfaced last year. As my Switch colleague Brian Fung noted, the promotional video features a lot of head-tilting that could indicate those reports are true. Business Insider notes that there&#39;s even something that clearly looks like a phone visible in Amazon&#39;s promo video.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">If Amazon can actually make a 3D display work in something that appeals to a wide audience, it will crack a problem that the tech industry has had for years -- how to get people to actually adopt 3D display technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It won&#39;t be easy. We&#39;ve been here, or somewhere near it, before. Back in 2011, when 3D video seemed like the coming trend, both HTC and LG tried to jump start a 3D smartphone movement. Both made phones with glasses-free displays that displayed images with depth, if not ones that actually popped up out of the screen.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Complaints about short battery life plagued both models. And the fact that users could only watch their 3D video on those specific devices kept the format from really taking off -- the phones simply weren&#39;t widespread enough.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Fast-forward three years, and some things have changed. For one, it seems more possible than ever that the real promise of a 3D display -- projecting holograms -- could feasibly work in a phone. One company, Ostendo, made headlines earlier this week after the Wall Street Journal featured the company&#39;s tiny, smartphone-sized holographic projector, which promises to bring crisp, usable holograms to your phone that pop out of the screen, rather than images that look fully fleshed-out to the user in front of them.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In that case, the reach problem wouldn&#39;t be as much of an issue, especially since the rumor mill indicates that Amazon won&#39;t be restricting the feature to only the media you&#39;d want to share, such as video, but applying it more broadly to things such as the icons.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What hasn&#39;t changed is that the amount of skepticism Amazon&#39;s supposed &quot;3D phone&quot; faced on its last time through the rumor mill.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Apart from a couple of notable applications -- mapping, perhaps, or video gaming -- many consumers are scratching their heads about what they&#39;d do, exactly, with a phone that projects 3D images. Sure, the idea that you could video chat, or even watch video in holographic form sounds intriguing. But it hardly seems practical in every day life unless you&#39;re willing to literally broadcast what you&#39;re doing on your phone to those around you.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In other words, if the rumors are true, Amazon will have to put forward a seriously good application of the technology on the phone to make a holographic display seem like anything other than a gimmick.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The book world is once again in a state of high dudgeon over the &quot;thuggish&quot; behavior of Amazon, which has begun slow-walking customer orders for books published by Hachette (James Patterson, Malcolm Gladwell, a.k.a.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">J.K. Rowling) in an effort to win more favorable terms in its next contract with the publisher.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In a series of breathless commentaries, Amazon has been likened to Vladimir Putin, Tony Soprano and Darth Vader, and accused of pursuing a &quot;scorched-earth capitalism&quot; designed to drive all publishers and competing booksellers out of business. The future of Western culture and democracy are said to hang in the balance.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">While the stakes, I suspect, are a good deal less dramatic than that, something interesting is going on here. In business terms, what is about to play out is the next round in a long-running battle between a manufacturing cartel (the publishers) and a monopoly retailer (Amazon) for control of the value chain that links book writers and their readers. In most respects, it is similar to the battles in other parts of the news and entertainment sector where digital technology has also upset the old order but a new order has yet to emerge.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Four years ago, in an earlier round of this battle, the publishers were victorious. It began when Amazon removed the &quot;Buy It Now&quot; button from all Macmillan books after the publisher demanded a new pricing model for e-books that would have forced Amazon to raise its prices. Macmillan responded by refusing to sell Amazon any of its books. Amazon, fearing it would lose its overwhelming dominance in the e-book business to Apple and the new iPad, caved to the publishers&#39; demand.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Round 2, however, went to Amazon. Prompted by a complaint by Amazon, the Justice Department launched a price-fixing investigation that uncovered a flagrant conspiracy among Apple and five of the biggest publishing houses to break Amazon&#39;s Kindle monopoly and raise e-book prices. To settle the government&#39;s allegations, the publishers agreed to pay $100 million in fines and rebates, and to modify their contracts to give Amazon the right to set whatever retail prices it wanted.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Now with those modified contracts expiring, the publishers and Amazon are about to do battle once again.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Amazon view, reflecting the tech culture, is that digital revolution makes it possible to reduce the role of the middlemen and gatekeepers of the old economy - the publishers - whose pricing models and ways of doing business limited competition and extracted too much money for themselves while adding too little value. If the publishers prevail, the Amazon camp foresees higher prices, fewer books by unknown writers and a slowdown in the transition to e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The industry&#39;s view is that by bringing the price-fixing case against the publishers, the government destroyed the last best hope of real competition in the book industry, in the name of trying to save it. While markets are great for things like toilet paper and soft drinks, it argues, they cannot be trusted to sustain a healthy book ecosystem capable of producing quality books. If Amazon is allowed to squeeze publishers even further, the industry warns that publishers will be starved for the money they use to support mid-list writers and new authors, reducing the book business to mass-appeal best-sellers and an endless supply of uncurated self-published dreck.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">I recently gained some new perspective on these issues while trying to sell my first book. While I came away from the process with a greater appreciation for what publishers, editors and agents do, I also came away thinking that the industry&#39;s pricing practices are a bit screwy.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s start with the author&#39;s advance - or more precisely, the non-refundable cash advance against the author&#39;s royalty payments for every book sold. In theory, the advance is supposed to reflect the publisher&#39;s best estimate of how many books will be sold. In practice, 80 percent of books don&#39;t sell enough copies to &quot;earn out&quot; the advance.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">This is a curious way for an industry to set pay for talent. If publishers are so bad at predicting book sales and can&#39;t stop themselves from overpaying on advances, then why not change to a system that doesn&#39;t require them to take virtually all of the upfront risk? As it happens, authors from time to time have offered to take a smaller advance in exchange for a royalty rate higher than the 15 percent industry standard. Such offers, however, are routinely and universally rejected.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">This is the kind of business practice that is common in cartel-like industries, like real estate agents and their 6 percent commissions. In this case, it&#39;s a way for publishers to stop themselves from getting into self-destructive bidding wars for best-selling authors and celebrity writers. And as long as all the publishers tacitly agree to play by the same rules, it allows them to under-pay these winners, to the benefit of both their shareholders and authors who never earn back their advances.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">This practice, however, is now threatened by self-publishing platforms at Amazon and elsewhere that make it possible for authors to bypass publishers completely - to hire freelance editors and publicists and sell their</p><ol id="l5"><ol id="l6"><li><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">ooks directly to readers online, keeping as much as 70 percent of the sales price. Given this threat to the publishers&#39; role as exclusive gatekeepers to the book distribution system, my guess is that it&#39;s only a matter of time before the key negotiations with authors will be over royalty percentages rather than advances. This more competitive arrangement would also force publishers to demonstrate they are providing good value for their services.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Another oddity of the publishing world is that those royalties are set differently for printed books and e-books. The accompanying chart, drawn from a recent presentation made by HarperCollins to industry analysts, tells the story. Authors makes about $1.60 less from a typical e-book sale than a hardcover sale, while the publishing house is left with $2.20 more in gross profit (that&#39;s the money used to pay for editing, marketing and general overhead, as well as profit for investors).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In other words, while the work done by author and publisher is exactly the same for a printed book or an e-book, what they are paid for that work is significantly different. Now ask yourself: Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense for the industry to change the way it structures royalties and wholesale prices so that everyone - the publishers, the authors and multi-channel retailers such as Amazon - are economically indifferent to what form of a book customers want to buy?</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The irony here is that despite the best efforts of the publishers to slow the migration from $28 hardbacks to $10 e-books, the shift has provided a significant boost to their profits and profitability. Cannibalizing their old business turns out to have been very good for the publishers&#39; bottom line. So you can perhaps understand why Amazon - which for all its market power makes very little profit on its e-book sales - is now demanding a bigger slice of the pie.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In this latest clash between the monopolist and the cartel, neither side comes with clean hands or pure heart. The publishers are more than a little disingenuous in conflating their own interests with those of authors, readers and booksellers. And Amazon might want to consider that its admirable campaign to lower book prices may have reached a point of diminishing return, with the risk that further cuts really will have an adverse effect on consumer choice and the quality of what is published.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Rather than using readers and writers as hostages in their ongoing battle over discounts, commissions and co-op fees, both sides might better use their ingenuity to come up with a simpler and more rational structure for the industry&#39;s economics that is better able to adapt to changing technology and market realities.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">(Note: For those who might question my motives in writing this column, let me acknowledge that I am hopelessly conflicted.

While it praised Hachette for negotiating &quot;in good faith,&quot; Amazon said &quot;we are not optimistic that this will be resolved soon.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;This is a monumental game of chicken,&quot; said Davia Temin, a crisis-management and media strategist at Temin and Co. in New York. &quot;We&#39;ve seen it before with CBS and cable stations, and other instances where the public has been disadvantaged because of a battle of titans where both of the titans seem to put the consumer last.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s defense came amid a chorus of criticism from authors, agents and others in the publishing business who have said the giant online retailer&#39;s tactics are hurting Hachette&#39;s sales, and thereby the publishing house&#39;s authors and readers. The publisher&#39;s authors have said that Amazon has kept their book prices high, stretched out delivery times and tried to direct customers to books published by other firms.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey P.

Rowling and Stephen Colbert.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Amazon said that Hachette titles made up only a tiny portion of its sales. &quot;If you order 1,000 items from Amazon, 989 will be unaffected by this interruption,&quot; it said. &quot;If you do need one of the affected titles quickly, we regret the inconvenience and encourage you to purchase a new or used version from one of our third-party sellers or from one of our competitors.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But some analysts said that Amazon risks driving customers away from other products.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;The minute some question your motive, your ubiquity, you&#39;re cracking your facade,&quot; Temin said. &quot;I wonder how good a strategy it is for your customer relations, especially since the core audience of Amazon started around books and a reverence for books.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Earlier on Tuesday, before Amazon posted its response, Reuters media columnist Jack Shafer proclaimed that he was going to stop purchasing goods from Amazon until it justified or ended its tactics in the Hachette dispute.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Amazon doesn&#39;t owe me access to Hachette titles, and I don&#39;t owe Amazon my business,&quot; he wrote. &quot;So I&#39;m stuffing my 1-click button into my drawer of abandoned devices and chargers and won&#39;t reclaim it until Amazon makes this thing right.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Tom Scocca, an editor for the Web site Gawker, said &quot;Amazon has gone too far,&quot; although he acknowledged the inconvenience and difficulty of shopping elsewhere in a piece titled &quot;Let&#39;s Boycott Amazon! Now Where Do We Buy Stuff?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Some analysts noted that publishers also strive to drive hard bargains, and that they have been doing well on the rising sales of e-books. Lagardère said in an earnings presentation this year that e-books made up 30 percent of Hachette&#39;s net U.S. sales in 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon said it would be willing to evenly split with Hachette the cost of a fund &quot;to be allocated by Hachette to mitigate the impact of this dispute on author royalties.&quot; It said it did this during a dispute with the publisher Macmillan.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Hachette issued a statement Wednesday saying, &quot;It is good to see Amazon acknowledge that its business decisions significantly affect authors&#39; lives.&quot; It said it would &quot;spare no effort&quot; to reach a deal with Amazon. Hachette said, &quot;Once we have reached such an agreement, we will be happy to discuss with Amazon its ideas about compensating authors for the damage its demand for improved terms may have done them, and to pass along any payments it considers appropriate.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Despite the obstacles Amazon erected for customers seeking Hachette books, many of the publisher&#39;s titles continue to sell well. Its imprints captured three of the top four spots on the current New York Times bestseller list for hardcover fiction and the number seven and eight spots for hardcover non-fiction. High Hachette sales could undercut arguments that Amazon possesses undue market power.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:steven.mufson@washpost.com">steven.mufson@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140529ea5t000gr</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark128">the-switch</a><a name="bookmark129">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Where to get Hachette books now (other than Amazon)</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Brian Fung 286 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">29 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">For the first time, Amazon is publicly acknowledging a long-simmering dispute between it and a major publishing company, Hachette Book Group.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">At the heart of the fight is how much money will flow to Hachette from Amazon sales of e-books. But because of the disagreement, Amazon is now playing hardball with the French-based publisher by stocking fewer print copies in its warehouses, ending support for Hachette pre-orders and making it generally more difficult for consumers to read Hachette-linked authors, such as J.K. Rowling.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">For titles where there are no copies on hand, customers can still place orders through Amazon, the company said, but they will take longer since Amazon must first order the inventory from Hachette. &quot;If you do need one of the affected titles quickly, we regret the inconvenience and encourage you to purchase a new or used version from one of our third-party sellers or from one of our competitors,&quot; Amazon said in a statement Tuesday</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">night. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Sounds simple enough. But most of us have grown accustomed to going to Amazon for practically all</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">ommerce. So, where can you pre-order, say, Robert Galbraith&#39;s (aka Rowling&#39;s) &quot;The Silkworm&quot; now?</p></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">One place to start looking is Barnes &amp; Noble, where pre-orders of Hachette books are still possible. Another option is Portland, Ore.-based Powell&#39;s. And if you&#39;re just looking for regular books that are already on the market, you can go straight to the source.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">On Amazon, meanwhile, you can still buy used titles from third-party resellers.

It received good reviews in Publishers&#39; Weekly, and Kirkus and was doing well with pre-publication orders on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Until Thursday.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That day, Amazon stopped taking advance orders and posted a notice saying &quot;Currently Unavailable,&quot; even though the publisher, Grand Central Publishing, said books are ready for shipping. Amazon said it would e-mail customers when the book becomes available.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon this week put the same notice on other new releases published by the Hachette Book Group, marking another step in the continuing spat over contract terms between the online retailing behemoth and the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">French-based publishing house, which owns Grand Central Publishing, Hyperion Books and Little, Brown &amp; Co. Among the books affected is J.K. Rowling&#39;s novel &quot;The Silkworm,&quot; due out June 19.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The two sides are widely believed to be bickering over e-book pricing and whether Amazon can get bigger discounts for Hachette books. Hachette alleges that Amazon has stretched out the delivery times of the publisher&#39;s books to as long as five weeks, even though Hachette has the books in stock. Hachette&#39;s authors have said that Amazon has also raised prices of the firm&#39;s books and tried to steer customers to books published by other companies in an effort to pressure Hachette into accepting Amazon&#39;s terms. Some Hachette books with modest sales volumes have been dropped altogether.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Please know that we are doing everything in our power to find a solution to this difficult situation, one that best serves our authors and their work, and that preserves our ability to survive and thrive as a strong and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">author-centric publishing company,&quot; Hachette chief executive Michael Pietsch said in a letter to authors this week.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">On the list of best-selling books on Amazon, Gordon&#39;s book had ranked in the 2,000 range Thursday and fell to 4,025 by midday Friday. By Friday evening, its ranking sank to 6,945.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">&quot;I spent three years on this book, and I&#39;m very happy and excited by it,&quot; Gordon said. &quot;But it&#39;s devastating as an author to see the market power they have. It just comes as a bit of a sucker punch when you are trying to reach an audience.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;m not inclined to make moral judgments. Private enterprises act in their own interests, and that&#39;s what they should be expected to do,&quot; said Mike Shatzkin, founder of the Idea Logical Company and author of a publishing blog called The Shatzkin Files.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Indeed, companies in other industries often pressure suppliers for better prices. Cable companies bargain with channels over television content, Wal-Mart pressures suppliers in its quest for low consumer prices, and physical bookstores seek payments from publishers for better shelf display.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But Shatzkin questioned whether Amazon&#39;s tactics this time were in the company&#39;s best interests. He said Amazon might argue that pressuring Hachette over better contract terms would help bring consumers lower prices in the long term. But for now, Shatzkin added, customers are suffering from higher prices and less choice.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The dispute has broken out now because of consent decrees signed in 2012. When publishers plotted earlier about how to resist Amazon&#39;s negotiating demands, the Justice Department said they were guilty of collusion ande-book price fixing under antitrust laws. It allowed retailers, including Amazon, to discount publishers&#39; lists by 30 percent for two years.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Hachette is one of five major publishing houses that agreed to terms under consent decrees. Negotiations between Amazon and the biggest publishing houses, Random House and Harper Collins, still lie ahead. Amazon is trying to set a precedent with the Hachette deal, publishing industry experts say.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;re going to drive out both distributors and the people who create the product. Plus writing is not a consumer product like tissue paper,&quot; Roxana Robinson, president of the Authors&#39; Guild, said. &quot;It&#39;s not a commodity. It&#39;s part of our culture and can&#39;t be controlled in this fashion.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Independent booksellers have been trying to take advantage of the Amazon dispute with Hachette. Politics and Prose in the District has set up a table featuring Hachette books, including &quot;David and Goliath&quot; by Malcolm Gladwell; Brad Stone&#39;s &quot;The Everything Store&quot; (about Amazon); Stephen Colbert&#39;s &quot;America Again&quot;; and James Patterson&#39;s &quot;Gone.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Bradley Graham, co-owner of Politics and Prose (and a former Washington Post staff writer), said the display had given some of the titles a boost in sales, but he deplored the impact of Amazon&#39;s feud with Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;If the Justice Department is not looking into this and remains reluctant to go after Amazon for their abusive behavior, then I think that should be a real concern to the American reading public,&quot; Graham said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">One of the authors caught in the middle is Daniel Schulman, who wrote &quot;Sons of Wichita,&quot; about the Koch brothers. The publication date was Tuesday, and the Amazon page for it says shipping will take three to five weeks. There is only a modest 10 percent discount from the $30 list price.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Hachette authors are kind of caught in the crossfire of this business dispute, and it&#39;s us that are really getting hurt here,&quot; Schulman said. &quot;This is how we make our livelihood. And if you can&#39;t sell books, it directly affects your ability to sell another book if your book is not seen as a success. It&#39;s disheartening after pouring your soul into the subject.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Schulman has been talking about his book at every opportunity, including public radio&#39;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot; and MSNBC. A New York Times review will appear this weekend, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;I kind of have the wind at my back,&quot; he said. &quot;I just want people to be able to go where they want to go to buy it. I&#39;m just trying to keep a level head. I think this situation is going to resolve itself in a few days. But I know other authors are just beside themselves.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:steven.mufson@washpost.com">steven.mufson@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140523ea5n007ka</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark134">National-Economy</a><a name="bookmark135">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Washington business agenda: Week of May 26, 2014; An executive from Amazon will discuss cloud</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">security at an event in McLean.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">350 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">24 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Ah, Memorial Day weekend. Time to kick back with something sizzling on the grill, a cold drink and -- if Amazon.com has anything to say about it -- enough popcorn to accommodate an end-to-end binge-watching of &quot;The Wire.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Last month, HBO and Amazon announced an agreement to put free episodes from the past seasons of some of their most popular shows on Amazon Prime Instant Video subscription service. It marked the first time that HBO had agreed to stream any of its shows off of its own app, HBO Go.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Now, just in time for the holiday weekend, Amazon announced Wednesday that the first wave of its content from HBO has hit its online video streaming site. The first round of shows includes the entire run of &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; &quot;The Wire,&quot; &quot;Deadwood,&quot; &quot;Rome&quot; and &quot;Six Feet Under,&quot; among others. Amazon is also offering a handful of episodes from other popular, ongoing series, such as &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; and &quot;True Blood&quot; as part of the deal, which is supposed to give the tech giant more exclusive HBO content in the coming years.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">This is part of a major effort by Amazon to pull more customers into its ecosystem and get them to become regular subscribers to its $99-a-year Prime service.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Here&#39;s the full list of shows coming to the service Tuesday, according to Amazon:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">All seasons of revered classics such as The Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood, Rome and Six Feet Under, and of recent favorites such as Eastbound &amp; Down, Enlightened and Flight of the Conchords Select seasons of current series such as True Blood, Boardwalk Empire andTreme Epic miniseries, including Band of Brothers, The Pacific, John Adams, Parade&#39;s End and Angels in America Hit original movies like Mary and Martha, Temple Grandin and You Don&#39;t Know Jack Hilarious original comedy specials from Louis CK, Ellen DeGeneres, Lewis Black and Bill Maher Pedigreed documentaries including When the Levees Broke, Ghosts of Abu</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Ghraib and the Autopsy and Iceman series Amazon&#39;s deal with HBO adds a big feather to the company&#39;s video-streaming cap as it takes on Hulu Plus, Apple, Google and, of course, Netflix -- which itself announced</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Wednesday that its greatly expanding its streaming empire in Europe . Amazon, which has had a much weaker selection of content than its competitors, has begun bidding much more aggressively for contracts -- something Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings noted in a Netflix earnings call last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The race to provide better, exclusive content has helped improve consumers&#39; options, though it may also behind recent price increases for Netflix and Amazon as the companies deal with fast growth and rising acquisition costs. Netflix just raised rates by $1 a month for new subscribers. Amazon announced in March that it was raising its annual Prime subscription rate, which also includes free two-day shipping, to $99 from $79.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In such a competitive market, giving customers access to prized programming is key. Consumers are less likely to question a price increase if they get to watch their favorite programming in a convenient way.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Prime Video has clearly become a much larger focus for Amazon, which has also launched its own original series and released a video set-top box, the Amazon Fire TV.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Controlling how consumers get access to television programming and movies gives tech companies like Amazon an easy path into the living room -- where Americans still spend a lot of time in front of the big screen.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">(Disclosure: Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.)

At the event, he announced his intent to deliver more than 120,000 signatures to the company&#39;s Seattle office in an effort to encourage the online retailer to drop the Boy Scouts from the list of organizations that can benefit from its charitable program, AmazonSmile.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Tessier&#39;s effort comes after the Boy Scouts kicked out Geoff McGrath, an openly gay scoutmaster in Seattle. Tessier, a senior at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, put his Eagle Scout rank on the line last year when he spoke to the media about being gay and participated in a public demonstration in advance of a vote held by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America to determine whether to lift a long-standing ban on gay members and leaders. Ultimately, the council voted to accept gay youths but not gay adults.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Tessier said what happened to McGrath confirmed for him that his time with the organization is limited - unless change occurs.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;It kind of re-ignited the feeling of anxiety and fear,&quot; he said. &quot;It proved they are still going to punish adults, so when I do turn 18, now I know for a fact I will get kicked out.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His birthday is in August.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Deron Smith, director of communications for the Boy Scouts of America, cited a previous statement on the issue in response to Tessier: &quot;Scouting represents millions of youth and adult members in diverse communities across the nation, many who have a variety of beliefs on a number of topics. We fully understand and appreciate that not everyone will agree with any one position or policy. America&#39;s youth need Scouting, and by continuing to focus on the goals that unite us we continue to accomplish incredible things for young people and the communities we serve. &quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">A spokesman for Amazon said in response to the protest that customers can select from nearly a million legally recognized charitable organizations on AmazonSmile. &quot;We rely on lists published by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to determine if certain organizations are ineligible to participate,&quot; Ty Rogers said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Tessier said he started gathering signatures through Change.org after learning that the policy for AmazonSmile prohibits organizations that &quot;engage in, support, encourage, or promote: intolerance, discrimination or discriminatory practices based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re just asking Amazon to stand by its own policy, and its commitment to the LGBT community,&quot; Tessier said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">On Wednesday, Tessier plans to travel to Seattle to formally petition Amazon.com and its founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Tessier said after he graduates from high school he plans to attend college in Ohio. He hopes to continue participating in Boy Scouts - but he&#39;s aware of the reality.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The likelihood of that happening is very slim,&quot; he said, &quot;because there is so little time to change so many minds.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">WP20140520Boyscoutprotest0520 Document WP00000020140520ea5k0002x</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 1/Image_014.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark140">CapitalBusiness</a><a name="bookmark141">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Local teen calls on Amazon to end support for Boy Scouts over policy on gay leaders; The petition,</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">spearheaded by a local boy scout, calls on the e-commerce giant to stand with LGBT advocates</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Steven Overly 672 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">20 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

Now, the Eagle Scout is taking the cause to the world&#39; s largest online retailer, Amazon.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Tessier has called on the e-commerce giant to bar the Boy Scouts of America from its charitable giving program, AmazonSmile, until the youth service organization permits openly gay men and women to serve in leadership roles.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">A Change.org petition Tessier created along with Scouts for Equality has garnered more than 124,000 signatures to date. Tessier and his mother, Tracie Felker, plan to fly to Seattle Tuesday morning to hand deliver the petition to Amazon&#39;s headquarters.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Amazon is known for being very progressive. They&#39;ve been a huge friend to the gay rights movement,&quot; Tessier said in an interview. &quot;However they&#39;re indirectly supporting discrimination. . .in their charitable giving programs.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Corporations have faced increasing pressure from customers for their stances on social and political policies. Last month, the newly appointed chief executive for Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox Web browser, resigned after heavy criticism of his contributions to same-sex marriage opponents.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon donates 0.5 percent of the price of purchases made through AmazonSmile to an organization of the buyer&#39;s choice. But Tessier asserts that including the Boy Scouts of America in that program violates Amazon&#39;s policy for eligible organizations.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s more asking Amazon to put action to their own words,&quot; Tessier said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The company&#39;s AmazonSmile Participation Agreement states organizations must &quot;not engage in, support, encourage, or promote: intolerance, discrimination or discriminatory practices based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Customers can select from nearly a million legally recognized 501(c)(3) charitable organizations on AmazonSmile. We rely on lists published by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the US Office of Foreign Assets Control to determine if certain organizations are ineligible to participate,&quot; Amazon.com spokesman Ty Rogers said via e-mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post and its affiliated publications, previously made a sizeable donation to organizations fighting for marriage equality in Washington state. Same-sex marriage was made legal there in 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The Boy Scouts of America has faced mounting pressure from its members and financial backers in recent years to become more inclusive of gay scouts and leaders. The organization reversed a ban on openly gay scouts last year, but continues to exclude gay and lesbian adults from membership.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;m trying to change a fine point in their policy,&quot; Tessier said. &quot;We&#39;re not trying to break it down or influence the gay agenda. We&#39;re trying to make it a better place where everyone can feel safe.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Tessier, a senior at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in Montgomery County, plans to study psychology at The College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio next year.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">When contacted about the Change.org petition, Boy Scouts of America spokesman Deron Smith issued the following statement:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Scouting represents millions of youth and adult members in diverse communities across the nation, many of whom have a variety of beliefs on a number of topics.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Earlier this month, Hewlett-Packard announced it was investing $1 billion in a new set of Internet cloud-based products, including an open-source software project called OpenStack. In January, IBM committed $1.2 billion to its own cloud division.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">As investments and competition among Internet cloud providers heat up, tech giants are finding new ways to distinguish their offerings. Amazon, Google and Microsoft recently engaged in a pricing war that drove down the fee for their public cloud services. HP is trying a different tack - emphasizing its open-source approach and encouraging businesses, its main customers, to use its product to create their own cloud services instead of relying on others.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Cloud services allow people and companies to store their information in such a way that it is accessible by the Internet, instead of marooned on one machine.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Competition is likely tightening in response to increased demand for cloud services from business customers. Spending on cloud services and technology is projected to grow by 25 percent in 2014 to reach more than $100 billion, according to a recent report from the research firm IDC.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Toward the end of March, Google senior vice president Urs Holzle announced the company&#39;s plan to reduce its cloud services prices by 30 to 85 percent. &quot;[O]ver the past five years, hardware costs improved by 20-30% annually but public cloud prices fell at just 8% per year,&quot; Holzle wrote in a blog post for Google. &quot;The cost of virtualized hardware should fall in line with the cost of the underlying real hardware.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">A day later, Amazon announced it was slashing prices for Amazon Web Services, cutting many of its offerings by 36 to 65 percent, its 42nd drop in price since 2008. The following week, Microsoft said it was slashing prices for its cloud service, Azure, by 35 to 65 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We recognize that economics are a primary driver for some customers adopting cloud, and stand by our commitment to match prices and be best-in-class on price performance,&quot; Steven Martin, general manager at Azure, wrote in a blog post in March.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">For these cloud giants, &quot;it becomes the race to scale - how many customers can you sign up, and how much are your hardware [costs] going down, that can allow you to scale out,&quot; said Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom. &quot;And the idea is initially, you&#39;re basically in land-grab mode.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;The way [other] companies are trying to differentiate themselves [is] by layering services . . . or they&#39;re trying to offer consulting engagements,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">If they can&#39;t compete by slashing prices to gain market share, cloud service providers might start focusing on niche markets, tailoring their software to particular industries, he said. HP, for instance, is focusing on private clouds - cloud networks that businesses use to store their own data and applications, instead of applications that would be used by the public.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In early May, HP said it would dedicate $1 billion over the next two years to cloud products and engineering products, renaming all its cloud offerings &quot;Helion.&quot; HP Helion includes products based on OpenStack, a version of</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">which it is offering free to customers to test pilots, develop proofs of concept and perform basic production tasks. HP will also help others resell OpenStack-based cloud services.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company plans to provide these services in 20 data centers globally over the next 18 months; it also pledged it will protect customers using OpenStack code from patent and copyright infringement claims related to the code.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">As part of its most recent investment, HP said it was creating a new practice made up of HP&#39;s consultants, engineers and technologists to help customers implement and maintain cloud services.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">HP&#39;s recent announcement, which regrouped its existing and new cloud offerings under Helion, was &quot;something that [competitors] are already doing, so it&#39;s kind of a catch-up and it&#39;s what needs to happen,&quot; Wahlstrom said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">For HP, &quot;cost is just one part of [the] equation&quot; for business customers, said Bill Hilf, vice president of product management for HP cloud.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">On Thursday, the new bestseller list arrived at the offices of Hachette Book Group with good news: One of the publisher&#39;s books, T.D. Jakes&#39;s &quot;Instinct,&quot; had vaulted to the No. 1 spot.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But the bad news was that anyone trying to order the book on Amazon.com on Friday got a message saying that it &quot;usually ships within 3 to 5 weeks,&quot; far slower than the fast delivery on which Amazon prides itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Hachette, which owns Little, Brown; Hyperion; and Grand Central, says that Amazon is deliberately slowing sales of Hachette&#39;s books in an effort to pressure the French publisher into agreeing to new contract terms on book pricing. Hachette says there is no shortage of the books.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We are satisfying all Amazon&#39;s orders promptly,&quot; Hachette said in a statement last week. &quot;Amazon is holding minimal stock and restocking some of HBG&#39;s books slowly, causing &#39;available 2-4 weeks&#39; messages, for reasons of their own.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post, would not comment for this article.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The dispute takes place amid a long-running battle between ever more dominant book retailers and big publishing houses over control of the future shape of the $15 billion book industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Agents, writers and publishing executives say that Amazon, which by some estimates accounts for half of all book sales, is playing hardball in a contract dispute about how big a discount Hachette will give the giant online retailer and how to set prices for e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Book industry leaders say that publishers ordinarily give bookstores discounts of 47 percent to 53 percent on wholesale prices to bolster booksellers&#39; profit margins and leave room for discounts to attract more consumers. But while neither Amazon nor Hachette would comment publicly on their talks, industry officials suspect that Amazon is demanding deeper discounts.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">When it comes to e-books, publishers have long tried to assert control over prices while Amazon has insisted on a cheaper, more uniform price of $9.99 a book, which book agents say has been lucrative for the publishing houses.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s not the first time Amazon and big publishing houses have fought over terms. The most notable instance was in 2010, when Macmillan resisted Amazon&#39;s effort to set all Kindle e-book prices at $9.99. Macmillan wanted some to be priced higher. So Amazon removed the &quot;buy&quot; buttons from all active Macmillan titles on its site.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;This one goes along with the pulling of the buy buttons as the most daunting exercise of brute market power,&quot; said Scott Turow, a Hachette author and former president of the Authors Guild. &quot;I regard the tactics as incomprehensible, and they are extremely unfair to readers and to authors.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Turow, a lawyer who has written 11 books, including legal thrillers such as &quot;Presumed Innocent,&quot; said that Amazon recently raised the price of his most recent book, &quot;Identical,&quot; a move that he said would depress sales. While Turow said the hardback version of his book is near the end of its sales cycle anyway and that a paperback version will be published in July, he said the Amazon sales tactics could hurt other Hachette authors with new releases.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Gail Hochman, president of the Association of Authors&#39; Representatives, said the group &quot;deplores any attempt by any party that would seek to injure and punish innocent authors — and their innocent readers — in order to pursue its position in a business dispute. We believe that such actions are analogous to hostage-taking to extort concessions, and are just as indefensible.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">She added, &quot;This is a brutal and manipulative tactic, ironically from a company that proclaims its goal to fully satisfy the reading needs and desires of its customers and to be a champion of authors.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Robert Gottlieb, chairman of Trident Media Group, said that he believed negotiations between Amazon and Hachette had intensified in light of the widespread publicity about the dispute, which the New York Times reported on last week.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The flap has also revived debates over whether Amazon has too much market power and whether it is violating antitrust laws when it uses its service to pressure publishers into agreeing to its terms.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In the past, the Justice Department has been sympathetic to Amazon, whose low prices work to the advantage of consumers. In 2012, Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon &amp; Schuster signed a consent decree with the Justice Department, which had sued publishers and Apple for conspiring to raise prices of e-books during a series of meals attended by their chief executives at upscale Manhattan restaurants.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Under the decree, Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon &amp; Schuster agreed that they would be prohibited for two years from entering into new agreements that might constrain retailers&#39; ability to offer discounts or other promotions to consumers to encourage the sale of the publishers&#39; e-books. That period expires this fall.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Other major publishers, including Macmillan, settled later and have not yet begun negotiating new agreements, industry officials said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Moreover, other book retailers have battled publishers. Barnes &amp; Noble, for example, has pressed publishers for payments in return for prominent shelf space.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What makes the dispute between Amazon and Hachette different is that Amazon&#39;s tactics have no obvious consumer benefit, a key antitrust consideration.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;What kind of entity in a competitive market would willfully drive customers into the arms of its competitors unless it believes it doesn&#39;t really have any competitors?&quot; Turow said. &quot;Can you imagine Best Buy refusing to deliver for a period of weeks what&#39;s available from its competitors? But Amazon behaves as though they&#39;re the only game in town. And increasingly they are. It&#39;s a head-scratcher why anyone with regulatory authority would tolerate it. If this is not an example of untoward power, I don&#39;t know what is.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Lawyers say, however, that the key antitrust questions are whether Amazon&#39;s actions are hurting consumers and whether Hachette has other outlets. The Jakes book&#39;s climb to the top of the bestseller list shows that people have found it elsewhere — physical bookstores or Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s online site.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Moreover, if Amazon were to use deeper discounts to provide low book prices to consumers, then arguably it has helped, not harmed, those consumers. That, Gottlieb noted, would be no different than Wal-Mart pressuring suppliers for lower prices. Health insurers have also used their market power to extract lower prices from drug companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But Gottlieb said that Amazon&#39;s pressure contacts were a &quot;double-edged sword. Amazon is not just a retailer; they&#39;re also a publisher. And the kind of goodwill you create in the industry has an impact on people doing business with you.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Writers, however, feel caught in the middle.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The blockbuster suspense author James Patterson posted his thoughts online: &quot;Right now, bookstores, libraries, authors, and books themselves are caught in the cross fire of an economic war. If this is the new American way, then maybe it has to be changed — by law, if necessary — immediately, if not sooner.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:steven.mufson@washpost.com">steven.mufson@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140516ea5g008n9</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark146">wonkblog</a><a name="bookmark147">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Just like big cable, Amazon wants to charge more for access to its pipes</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Lydia DePillis 542 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">14 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">A few days ago, the New York Times revealed that Amazon had been playing hardball with Hachette, a major New York book publisher with big sellers like Stephen Colbert and Malcolm Gladwell. The e-commerce site wasn&#39;t happy with the outcome of contract negotiations, the Times reported, and so has started to suggest other books when customers try to order something from Hachette — and if they proceed to checkout, the book might take weeks to arrive.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Authors, understandably, are irate over the unequal treatment. Even if they have other options, like Barnes &amp; Noble or even their local bookstore, a certain number of people will end up not buying the book at all — which especially hurts some of the writers who aren&#39;t as famous as Gladwell or Colbert.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon, which didn&#39;t respond to a request for clarification from The Washington Post, is by no means unique in employing this tactic. All big multi-brand retailers choose what to sell in their stores, and when they have enough market power, can extract substantial concessions from the companies whose products they allow in. That&#39;s Walmart&#39;s whole business model: Require vendors to squeeze as much cost out of their supply chains as possible so they can end up at the lowest price. Even Whole Foods does it, expelling the Greek yogurt brand Chobani when it declined to create &quot;unique&quot; options for Whole Foods stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The problem comes in, however, when the consumer doesn&#39;t have other options. That&#39;s why people are so upset about the Federal Communications Commission&#39;s plan to allow cable companies to charge Internet businesses more for faster access: With only a couple cable providers out there, the Netflixes and YouTubes of the world will have no choice but to pay up, while smaller players could be consigned to slow loading times forever.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In some ways, Amazon&#39;s decision to choke off Hachette is similar. Wanting to give consumers access to its products through the biggest single pipeline available, Hachette may relent on the price at which it sells books to Amazon, squeezing its slim profit margins even further. As Amazon gains more and more market share, its power to do so will only increase. And as Slate&#39;s Jordan Weissman points out, our antitrust law is all geared toward lower prices for consumers, so there&#39;s likely nothing Hachette can do about it (unless Amazon, in its</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">now-pressing quest for profit, starts to charge more on top).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">So, what to make of this? It depends on how you want to think about Amazon as a middleman. If it&#39;s just one storefront among many to purchase products, it can cut whatever deals it wants, and you can take your business elsewhere. Increasingly, though, we&#39;re starting to see it as an open-access marketplace, on which vendors sell their products directly to consumers — if there&#39;s no real choice of where to buy things, maybe there should be some other way to retain pricing power for those who produce goods in the first place.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

Here’s why.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Dominic Basulto 857 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">13 May 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Next year around this time, we may be talking about an explosion of interest by employers for recent college grads who know how to operate drones. That&#39;s right — the same way that we currently hear about the IT skills gap in hot areas such as mobile and the cloud and big data — we may be hearing about the need for IT workers with skills and experience related to drone technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">One key factor is the relentless growth of new business opportunities for drones. It is almost a certainty that the ability to build, pilot and monitor these drones is going to be hugely important once commercial drones get the go-ahead from the FAA. Sure, there are the high-profile business cases — such as the Amazon retail delivery drones or the Domino&#39;s pizza delivery drones — but there are also everyday use cases that extend from filmmaking and aerial photography to fields such as real estate, farming and pipeline maintenance. Journalists want to work with them. As do meteorologists. And, yes, the Pentagon is definitely interested in the future of drones, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">According to a 2013 report from the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, FAA approval of commercial drones could lead to the creation of 70,000 new U.S. jobs within the next three years, and 100,000 new U.S. jobs by the year 2025. Many of these early jobs, most likely, will be involved in integrating commercial drones into commercial airspace. At any time, there are thousands of commercial aircraft airborne in U.S. airspace, and it&#39;s possible that there will be just as many drones within a few short years. Some predict drones to become an $80 billion business opportunity by 2025.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Already, we&#39;re starting to see the first testing of commercial drones at FAA test sites in places such as New York, North Dakota, Alaska, Nevada, Texas and Virginia. The goal of these new FAA sites is to test out drones in a variety of climates, environments and use cases. The drones in New York, for example, are meant to test out ways to integrate commercial drones into congested Northeastern air space. (So that we avoid incidents like this) And the drones in North Dakota are going to be used to test out approaches related to farming management and agriculture research.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">To keep up with this projected demand for drone skills, there is now a growing number of official programs and academic opportunities for drone operators. Once companies start hiring, they&#39;re probably going to pass on recent engineering grads with a theoretical knowledge of machine propulsion or navigation systems, in favor of candidates with hands-on experience who know how to get a drone airborne from a dead start, and maneuver it around for photos. When Amazon starts hiring drone operators, for example, it probably won&#39;t want to build a drone-training program from scratch.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Which might explain why we&#39;re starting to see some very innovative types of academic programs for the drone technology experts of tomorrow. It&#39;s the basic law of supply and demand at work. The Unmanned Vehicle University in Phoenix, for example, can set you up with a variety of career options — piloting a drone, becoming an aerial drone photographer, or starting a career as a UAV systems engineer. The Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University offers a bachelor&#39;s degree in Unmanned Aircraft Systems Science. The University of North Dakota offers a four-year program for future Unmanned Aerial Vehicles pilots, while Kansas State offers an undergraduate degree in Unmanned Aircraft Studies.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What&#39;s interesting is how all this might change the employment landscape for technology. Most of the big technology employment hubs — places such as New York and Boston — thrive on urban density. Entrepreneurs like to cluster together. With drone technology, it&#39;s the opposite. Most of the big drone-testing sites are in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">out-of-the-way locations: North Dakota not New York. Even the test site in New York state is located far from</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Manhattan or Brooklyn, meaning that Brooklyn hipsters are about to be replaced by upstate rural residents as the arbiters of tech cool.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Of course, all this sounds a bit fantastical. North Dakota hopes to eventually become the new Silicon Valley? Really? And there are obviously a lot of safety factors to keep in mind before commercial drones hit the mainstream. Yet, the next time you hear your neighbor talking about buying a Parrot Bebop quadcopter and Oculus Rift VR headset, don&#39;t be so quick to dismiss him or her. Getting an early jump on these consumer drone technologies may be the secret to a six-figure job offer later, even if it means moving to a place like Kansas or North Dakota. The same way that tech companies now complain about a lack of talent in areas such as mobile or big data, they may be talking about a drone talent gap within a few years.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

Especially in the technology field.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Carlson, who previously served as vice president of federal government business at Microsoft, said she surprisingly hasn&#39;t encountered too many challenges in her 16 years in the technology industry. Instead of fixating on the obstacles for women in tech, Carlson said she hopes more women will focus on how their unique skills could make them competitive in the field.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">At this year&#39;s FOSE conference in Washington — an annual federal contracting expo drawing executives from the country&#39;s largest tech companies — Carlson and a handful of other female leaders from the public and private sectors plan to discuss the employment outlook for women in technology; their panel is called &quot;Women Leaders in Technology: Opportunities and Top Issues from IT Leaders.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">According FOSE, in the United States, women held only 25 percent of computing occupations in 2013,citing data from the AFL-CIO. Women&#39;s employment growth in science, technology, engineering and mathematics jobs has slowed, according to a Census Bureau report. In 2011, women held 27 percent of computer jobs.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Despite the statistics, Carlson said she often speaks to women at universities who are interested in coding and development. Framing technology jobs differently — emphasizing the group-work aspects of coding, for instance</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">— could attract more of them to the field, she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">&quot;Women and young girls are very social. They like problem solving. Information technology can really allow them to come together, crowd source, solve problems together and take on world issues. I believe that&#39;s going to be a huge driver of more women moving into an IT career,&quot; Carlson said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Lisa Schlosser, the Office of Management and Budget&#39;s deputy associate administrator for the Office of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">E-Government and Information Technology, noted that women are making progress in the public sector: The federal government has at least eight female chief information officers, and the majority of the Department of Homeland Security&#39;s cybersecurity division is female, she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">But, she said, &quot;We still have a long way to go. And if I look in general at the landscape, you&#39;re still around 14 percent of top corporate executive jobs held by women.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And the gender-pay gap still persists, she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;As a society, we have to start this new paradigm where we start early with girls in schools — all the way from toddlers on up — and engage them and get them excited [about] the sciences, in technology, in math, in leadership programs. I think you see a lot of girls not wanting to step up.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">She said it is important to encourage girls to network with powerful women, and make strong professional connections. &quot;Historically, I think men have done a great job in building relationships, in networking, from the time they&#39;re young throughout their career.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The public and private sectors face the same problems attracting women to technology fields, Schlosser said, and for each, the solutions are the same.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re trying to put in place strategic programs to get more kids in general involved with [science, technology, engineering and math], and then encourage women to do that. I think that will open doors within the government and the private sector.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Also scheduled to speak on the panel are NSA Director of the Information Assurance Directorate Debora Plunkett, Small Business Administration Chief Information Officer and Chief Privacy Officer Renee Macklin, and Experian President of Public Sector Business Barbara Rivera. Morris Jones, anchor and host of weekly ABC television show Government Matters, will moderate. FOSE 2014 runs Tuesday through Thursday of this week at the Walter E.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Alibaba&#39;s plans to file for an initial public offering has Wall Street investors cheering. But the company&#39;s foray into the U.S. stock market could also be a boon for Silicon Valley.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Alibaba is expected to raise as much as $20 billion in its debut, which would make it one of the biggest tech IPOs in history, surpassing Facebook&#39;s record of $16 billion in 2012. The additional cash would give the firm more resources to shore up its presence in the American tech industry, analysts say.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">In recent years, the Chinese e-commerce giant has used its massive fortune to invest in several Bay Area</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">start-ups, including ShopRunner, a subscription service similar to Amazon Prime, and Lyft, a ride-sharing service featuring cars with pink mustaches that competes with Uber. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The company, which controls about 80 percent of China&#39;s e-commerce market, is in no hurry to compete directly with Amazon and other online retailers in the United States, industry observers say. But its investments in the tech space are part of a long-term expansion strategy, they say.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Should Alibaba decide to enter the U.S. market tomorrow, it would face several challenges, analysts say. The company&#39;s experience is limited to emerging markets such as China, where it dominates the online shopping landscape.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;As a foreign company, it&#39;s hard for them to understand the U.S. market,&quot; said Yan Anthea Zhang, a professor at Rice University&#39;s Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business. &quot;Alibaba cannot simply duplicate its business models here.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Instead, the retailer is using its investments to learn about the U.S. market and experiment with different kinds of businesses, she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s also why, unlike its acquisition spree in China, Alibaba has been content to buy small stakes in U.S. start-ups, Zhang said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Ahead of its IPO, Alibaba bought controlling stakes in several Chinese companies including AutoNavi, an online navigation company, and Intime Retail, a Chinese department store.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But in the United States, Alibaba is one of several backers for smaller specialty e-commerce sites, such as 1stdibs.com, a Web site for antiques and luxury items, and the soon-to-be-launched 11Main.com, which will sell goods from boutique stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">There&#39;s another advantage that investing in Silicon Valley holds for the retailer — a quick inroad into new technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Alibaba wants to invest in innovation, said Reena Aggarwal, a professor of finance at Georgetown University&#39;s McDonough School of Business, who has researched IPOs extensively.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">&quot;Many of the innovative companies that fit well with Alibaba&#39;s model of e-commerce are based in the U.S.,&quot; she said. &quot;They&#39;re just going after the best technology.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Alibaba is estimated to be worth $150 billion to $200 billion, bigger than either Amazon or eBay, but behind Apple, Google and Microsoft. The company has a range of businesses — including an online payment service, a money market fund and a cloud-computing operation.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Alibaba is a business empire and in the long term, its size will give it an advantage,&quot; said Zhang, the Rice University professor.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But in the short term, she said, a successful IPO will give Alibaba something it takes for granted in China — brand recognition.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">amrita.jayakumar@washpost.com Document WPCOM00020140508ea5700001</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 13-14 1/Image_019.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark154">Business</a><a name="bookmark155">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Small business advice: Should your company deliver to customers’ doorsteps?; Amazon and Google are</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">expanding their delivery services.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Scarcity rules the world of business, and no scarcity is more pressing to customers than time. Customers are starting to demand the convenience of delivery to squeeze a little more into their day — and businesses are taking notice.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon will soon roll out its own private fleet of trucks to make more same-day deliveries. Google is hot on its heels, planning to expand its own same-day delivery service. Uber is starting to push into the arena, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Delivery is hot right now, but how do you know whether it&#39;s right for your business? And if it is the right move, where do you start? Here are some tips for small business owners.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Determining whether delivery is right for you</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">As you&#39;re considering implementing delivery into your business model, consider the following questions to help you make an informed decision.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Are my competitors delivering? If they are, how are they doing it? Is there a demand? What are they charging? Try a service for yourself by ordering from a competitor and being a critic. Take notes on what went well, what didn&#39;t and how you could improve it.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">If they aren&#39;t offering delivery, find out why. Are insurance costs too high? Have they tried and failed? Pretend to be a customer, and call to ask for delivery. Then, ask whether they&#39;re considering doing it in the future. The answers could be enlightening.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">How will I differentiate my services? If everyone else in your space is delivering, what will be your differentiator? Maybe your drivers will dress in tuxedos or use advanced technology, or maybe you will provide a small gift to each of your customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Choose something they won&#39;t soon forget. Preparing to take your products to doorsteps</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Starting a new delivery service may seem daunting, if you decide to go that route. However, there are some steps you can take to make the progression easier:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Start small. You can always expand your delivery zone later, but starting small will help ensure the quality of your service. As you become more established, you&#39;re more likely to be able to expand without sacrificing quality.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Appoint a head of delivery. Whether it&#39;s the business owner or another employee, someone needs to own the delivery experience for the customer, from start to finish. All compliments, complaints and questions must go to a single point of contact so you can accurately track the experiment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Set clear expectations with staff. The delivery staff that brings your product to the customer is the only in-person interaction the customer will have with your company. Train one delivery driver at a time, then release that driver to train another. Carefully building your delivery team ensures quality and consistency.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Use the first five seconds to your advantage. The first five seconds of the customer&#39;s interaction with your service is critical. Train your staff to smile, provide a proper greeting, and say &quot;thank you&quot; to every customer.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Survey and solicit feedback. If the same customer orders from you over and over again, reach out and see if you can ask him or her a few questions about your new delivery program. Often, customers have a unique perspective and will be glad to share it.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Remember, it&#39;s all about saving your customers time. If you decide to offer delivery, it&#39;s not just about bringing a milk container to the customer — it&#39;s a 15-minute errand that was keeping that person from doing something else.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">When you deliver to your customers&#39; front doors, you can help them reclaim their time for more meaningful activities — and that can help your company stand out.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Phil Dumontet is the founder and chief executive of DASHED, a restaurant delivery company in the Northeast.

The company has cleverly lifted the curtain ever so slightly on its once secretive innovations lab (Google X), because it knows positive stories will be published.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Facebook turned heads when it bought Oculus Rift — the maker of virtual-reality technology that appears to have absolutely no connection to Facebook&#39;s core business. But chief executive Mark Zuckerberg talks of using virtual reality to help billions worldwide share spaces and experiences. Some of these companies&#39; moonshots will certainly fail, but the excitement and buzz they generate is worth it.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon, Google and Facebook all have something else in common — a higher price-to-earnings ratio than Microsoft. A high price-to-earning ratio indicates that investors expect a company to grow, so they will pay a premium to own stock in it. It&#39;s worth noting that the other tech giant, Apple, which is notoriously tight-lipped about its upcoming plans, has a low price-to-earnings ratio comparable to Microsoft. When you aren&#39;t hyping your next innovation, investors aren&#39;t going to be convinced you will grow.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The recent narrative on Microsoft isn&#39;t one of remarkable world-changing ideas and innovation. It was late to embrace smartphones and tablets, and must cling to the Windows and Office businesses. Former chief executive Steve Ballmer was memorably skeptical of the iPhone&#39;s potential (It&#39;s since gone on to be arguable the most successful product ever).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But with a new chief executive in Satya Nadella, Microsoft has a perfect opening to prove to the world it can still innovate.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">For the past 10 years Microsoft&#39;s stock has trailed the S&amp;P 500 index. It&#39;s not the remarkable growth company it was during the &#39;90s. In fairness, part of the challenge is just how big it is. For a company with a market cap of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">$337 billion to grow significantly is much harder than for a smaller company.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Google has run into the problem of the law of large numbers — its market cap is similar to Microsoft&#39;s — yet it remains a company that is seen to have a bright and growing future. Google has branched off into potential growth areas, gobbling up robot companies and developing a self-driving car. Most still see Microsoft as the company of Office and Windows.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Microsoft may be fixing that as it gets into the moonshot game.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s long had Microsoft Research, home to 1,100 scientists and engineers, yet their work hasn&#39;t been fawned over like what happens at Google X. New branding may change that. A recent job listing mentions a &quot;Special Projects&quot; team within Microsoft Research that would work &quot;on disruptive technologies that could benefit the company and society.&quot; Another posting describes the team as &quot;a new startup group focused on disruptive next-generation technologies.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That all sounds quite a bit like what Google chief executive Larry Page says when he explains why disruptive companies can be more valuable to society than traditional charities.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">ZDNet&#39;s Mary Jo Foley has reported that Norman Whitaker, a former program manager at DARPA, will lead the Special Projects team. Given DARPA&#39;s track record, it&#39;s easy to see excitement over what his new team could dream up.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s unclear if the Special Projects group will pull off anything special. But if its high-minded goals could win the hearts of investors and potential employees, that will go a long way toward returning Microsoft to its glory years.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

Though the company&#39;s sales were up 23 percent from the same quarter last year, reaching $19.74 billion, operating income decreased 19 percent to $146 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: justify;">mohana.ravindranath@washpost.com Document WPCOM00020140429ea4t0070t</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark162">the-switch</a><a name="bookmark163">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Wearable tech grows enough to get its own section on Amazon</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 490 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">29 April 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

(Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Wearable technology has become a prime focus for many major tech companies, from Google to Microsoft and (at least in rumor) Apple. In fact, Mashable reported on Tuesday that Apple was recently awarded a new patent for a head-mounted display that appears to resemble the virtual Rift goggles made by Oculus, the firm Facebook recently bought for $2 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But while there&#39;s been a lot of attention paid to what Google is doing with Glass or what Microsoft is planning with its big push into the Internet of Things, it&#39;s easy to forget that there are a slew of smaller companies devoted to making specialized, wearable tech. And all are fighting for visibility. The dedicated online store offers a wider look at that world, showing the products that are already on the market and highlighting more than just the fitness trackers that have, thus far, been the category&#39;s biggest standout. The site arranges health-care devices, wearable cameras, trackers and smart watches into principal sub-categories. It also features explanatory articles, educational videos and buying guides to help customers navigate through the new products.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">With the new section, Amazon has positioned itself as a platform for introducing the latest pieces of wearable technology. To kick off the site, for example, the retailer is offering an exclusive deal to pre-order the Misfit Bloom necklace, an $80 necklace that works with the Misfit Shine fitness tracker.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">While tech companies appear pretty excited about wearables, consumers have indicated that they need a little more convincing. In a survey published by Nielsen last month, 70 percent of American respondents said they were aware of wearable tech, while only 15 percent said they currently use some form of wearable tech in their daily lives. Nearly half of those who responded to the survey said that they were interested in buying a piece of wearable technology but that factors such as price and aesthetics -- 53 percent said that they wanted the tech to look more like jewelry -- were in the way.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140429ea4t00695</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark164">Business</a><a name="bookmark165">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Tech selloff drives stocks down</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">- Bloomberg News 281 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">27 April 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">FINAL G07</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan&#39;s final April reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 84.1, beating an expectation of 83.0 in a Reuters survey and up from 80.0 the month before. The preliminary April reading was 82.6. The headline number was the highest reading since July 2013. &quot;Perhaps the more important question is whether consumer confidence will show greater resistance to the backslides that have repeatedly occurred in the past few years,&quot; survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. &quot;Resilience is dependent on positive long term economic expectations.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">l A U.S. appeals court will consider Apple&#39;s request to delay a July trial to determine how much the iPad maker must pay in damages to customers in more than two dozen states over e-book price fixing. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit said that a three-judge panel will hear Apple&#39;s argument on why the trial should be put on hold while it appeals a judge&#39;s ruling that it conspired with five publishers to raise e-book prices. U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in New York had denied Apple&#39;s request to postpone the trial on Wednesday. Cote ruled last year after a nonjury trial that Apple had conspired with the publishers in an effort to impede competitors such as Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">l</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">A federal judge on Friday approved the November settlement between the U.S. government and the airlines that merged to form American Airlines Group, the world&#39;s biggest carrier. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said the settlement, which required American to sell takeoff and landing rights at airports in the New York and Washington areas and airport gates in five other cities, was &quot;within the reaches of the public interest.&quot; She said a hearing was not needed.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">l A Delaware judge has ruled that Philadelphia&#39;s two largest newspapers will be sold at an ascending-bid auction open only to insiders. The decision Friday is a victory for majority owner George Norcross in his fight for control of the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News. Norcross and fellow investor Lewis Katz have been locked in a fight over how to run the company, prompting the latest sale. Both men have pledged to open with a starting bid of $77 million. The local newspaper guild had hoped to bid with backing from an investor, but said this week it would not match that opening bid.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20140426digest0426</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020140426ea4q00024</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark168">CapitalBusiness</a><a name="bookmark169">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">LivingSocial breaks into black; Amazon earnings say stake in deals site worth $100M; The daily deals</h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">site, which has yet to turn an operating profit, sees revenue drop from one year ago</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Thomas Heath 304 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">25 April 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

LivingSocial netted $205 million on the sale.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The company reported revenue of $77 million, which is down from the $108 million it recorded during the first quarter of 2013, according to the filing.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The company has yet to turn a profit, and its valuation of around $300 million is a fraction of what it was two years ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">LivingSocial has retrenched in recent months, pulling back from producing live events, closing its facility at 918 F St. NW and focusing more on providing merchants with an online platform to market their products.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;In September 2013, LivingSocial announced a strategic refocusing to emphasize marketplace innovation, product development, and marketing in the U.S. and other regions in which we operate,&quot; said LivingSocial chief financial officer John Bax in a statement released early Friday by the company. In the first quarter of this year, Bax wrote &quot;we took a number of significant steps forward in this effort, including a first wave of extended merchant and consumer flexibility, the transition of our live events business, significant improvement in our mobile apps, and the sale of our businesses in Southeast Asia which closed just as we entered the second quarter.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:thomas.heath@washpost.com">thomas.heath@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140425ea4p005se</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark170">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark171">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s profit up18 percent in quarter American, Southwest report record profits</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">795 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">25 April 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">FINAL A14</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

On Thursday, it launched Prime Pantry, a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">grocery-delivery service for Prime members. And earlier this month, it introduced its first set-top video-streaming box called Amazon Fire, which sells for $99.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We get our energy from inventing on behalf of customers, and 2014 is off to a kinetic start,&quot; said chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Although investors have largely given Amazon a pass for focusing on growth and investing rather than turning a strong profit, Amazon has been making some moves lately to strengthen its bottom line. It boosted the annual fee for its Prime two-day-shipping membership program to $99 from $79 in March to offset higher shipping costs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Shipping costs rose 31 percent, to $1.83 billion, during the quarter.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">And to entice more people to sign up for the service at the $99 price, which includes its streaming-video service, on Wednesday the retailer said it inked a deal with HBO to stream some of its older shows online beginning May</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">21. The news was a coup for Amazon. HBO has steadfastly refused to license its programming to other streaming services.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Net income for the quarter rose to $108 million, or 23 cents per share. That compares with net income of $82 million, or 18 cents per share last year. Analysts expected 21 cents per share.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Revenue rose 23 percent, to $19.74 billion. Analysts expected $19.42 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Even with the turbulence of severe winter storms and stubbornly high fuel prices, many of the major airlines are cruising, and their stock prices are rising.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">On Thursday, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines reported record profits for the first quarter, usually the weakest time of year for the airlines. That followed a rousing report from Delta Air Lines a day earlier.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Still stuck on the tarmac: United Airlines, which lost $609 million during the first three months of the year. Its shares fell nearly 10 percent, to $41.53. Revenue for every seat flown one mile, a key measure in the airline business, fell 2 percent, which United blamed mostly on canceled flights.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The same figure rose 3 percent at American Airlines Group, the company formed by December&#39;s merger of American and US Airways. That helped American swing to a $480 million profit, a record for American for the usually weak first quarter, as revenue rose 6 percent. American&#39;s shares were up 0.5, percent to $37.26.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Southwest Airlines also set a first-quarter record with its profit of $152 million, more than doubling the year-ago number despite 7,500 weather-related flight cancellations that the company said reduced profit by $50 million. Its shares gained 0.8 percent, to $24.27.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">JetBlue Airways reported a profit despite weather cancellations that helped send net income down about 71 percent, to $4 million, or a penny per share. Its shares closed down 2.6 percent, to $8.37.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">On Wednesday, Delta said it canceled more than 17,000 flights in January and February and still beat expectations with a $213 million profit. Its stock closed down 1 percent, to $36.73.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">l Netflix reached an agreement with three cable companies that, for the first time, will let U.S. subscribers watch the streaming-video service as though it were an ordinary cable channel. The deal will make all Netflix content available to subscribers nationwide on RCN, Grande Communications and Atlantic Broadband. Altogether, the agreement covers as many as 500,000 of the cable firms&#39; existing subscribers - though that figure could grow as more customers sign up.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">l Facebook acquired the startup behind the popular fitness tracking app Moves. Facebook said it bought ProtoGeo Oy, the Finnish company behind the app, for an undisclosed sum. The Moves app has been downloaded 4 million times on Android phones and iPhones. It lets people automatically track their runs, walks or bike rides and plots their routes on a map.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">l Microsoft&#39;s push into cloud computing, which is accelerating under new chief executive Satya Nadella, paid off in the fiscal third quarter. Net income in the period that ended March 31 was $5.66 billion, or 68 cents a share, Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft said. That topped the average analyst estimate of 63 cents. Sales were $20.4 billion.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">l Earnings: Burger King Worldwide, Ford Motor.

The service will start May 21, so if free two-day shipping wasn&#39;t enough to keep you paying now $99 per year for your Prime membership, perhaps Kenny Powers&#39;s glorious curly mullet will.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020140423ea4n004xv</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark178">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark179">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Book by economist becomes a surprise Amazon bestseller</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Jia Lynn Yang 584 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">23 April 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">FINAL A10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The new book by economist Thomas Piketty, &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century,&quot; is a runaway hit, perched at the top of Amazon.com&#39;s bestsellers chart and temporarily sold out on the Web site.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The book has sold about 48,000 hardcover copies and 8,000 to 9,000 e-book versions, according to Susan Donnelly, sales and marketing director at Harvard University Press, the publisher behind the English-language version. (The book was written in French and released in France last year.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Presses are cranking it out in the United States, India and Britain, and the book is in at least its fourth run. Even though the book was a hit in its native France, it&#39;s just now taking off among English readers around the world, Donnelly said. She expects that sales in China, Hong Kong and Japan will also soon follow.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Piketty, widely cited for his work on income inequality, has clearly touched a nerve. Many societies around the world are grappling with a growing gap between rich and poor, especially in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and the issue has become politically charged.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Piketty&#39;s book has made waves because it argues that the underlying mechanisms of capitalism tend toward massive inequality. He writes that the era between 1930 and 1975 - often hailed for the way in which wealth was broadly shared - was actually a departure from the norm.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">That period of economic growth, he says, was the result of unusual circumstances such as World War II, a global depression and the government&#39;s actions in the aftermath of those events: strong policies raising taxes and increasing regulation. But now, with many of those policies rolled back, societies are reverting back to extreme inequality.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The unlikely bestseller, clocking in at almost 700 pages, is serving as an interesting case study for modern book publishing.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">One of the hallmarks of the book&#39;s success is that it is sold out on Amazon, even though a digital version is available on Kindle, too. (The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;You can have it on your e-book reader, but that&#39;s not the same as having the book,&quot; Donnelly said. &quot;I&#39;m not saying this book is a Tiffany&#39;s bag, but nobodygoes to Tiffany&#39;s and buys something and doesn&#39;t get that little blue bag. I think there&#39;s still some of that about books.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Another possible factor is that the Kindle version retails for nearly as much as the hardcover on Amazon. The digital book is $21.99; the hardcover costs $24.76.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The book is poised to become the most popular ever for Harvard University Press, better known for serious intellectual tomes than for bestsellers. Piketty&#39;s book has sold 57,000 copies after only a few weeks. By comparison, the publisher&#39;s last two successes sold 60,000 each in their first year, Donnelly said. She predicts that Piketty&#39;s book will become akin to another classic for the publisher, John Rawls&#39;s &quot;A Theory of Justice.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s going in that small cluster of books that makes a real contribution to intellectual and moral discussions in our day,&quot; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Donnelly added that even though the book is sold out on Amazon, copies can be bought directly from the publisher.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Excerpted from Wonkblog at washingtonpost.com/wonkblog.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Slate on Monday announced a new subscription model that it wants to be super sure you know is not a paywall . Called Slate Plus, it keeps most content available for free, but offers subscribers bonuses such as online chats with reporters. The subscribers will pay $5 a month or $50 a year. The bonuses also include discounts or special seats at Slate events and early access to some articles.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s not a paywall,&quot; David Plotz, the editor of the online magazine, wrote in a post announcing the service -- twice.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;Our model is Amazon Prime, which just keeps on adding benefits,&quot; he wrote. Amazon Prime, which started as a membership program that offered free shipping on most orders for an annual flat fee, has added new features including streaming video and an e-book lending library since its inception -- and only raised the price once in nine years .</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Readers may remember that this very outlet, The Washington Post, was bought by Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos last year. But not every publication owned by what was then The Washington Post Co., now Graham Holdings, was part of the deal. Some properties, including Slate and Foreign Policy, were left out.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s no secret that media outlets have struggled to figure out how best to monetize their content -- arguably, that&#39;s what led to The Washington Post&#39;s sale in the first place. And Slate, like many sites, has primarily relied on advertising since its inception as one of the earliest online only outlets nearly 18 years ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;And while advertising remains central to our success, we think we&#39;d be better off if we were less dependent on it,&quot; writes Plotz. &quot;We also think it&#39;s important to give readers a stake in the journalism they value.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Slate is far from the first online media outlet to give a subscription model a try, but many including The Post and the New York Times use a paywall that kicks in after a set number of visits per month to encourage regular readers to sign up.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In fact, Slate tried out a more traditional subscription model along those lines in the late 1990s, before the outlet was sold to The Washington Post Co. by Microsoft in 2004. But perhaps the most direct analogue to Slate&#39;s new set up is Talking Point Memo&#39;s membership program, which is known as TPM Prime.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document WPCOM00020140421ea4l007vd</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark182">Amazon moving fast to improve Fire TV</a><a name="bookmark183">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 326 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">19 April 2014 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.

In fact, this was the main selling point in its first commercial, a bizarre spot starring Gary Busey happily talking to inanimate objects.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But the reality fell short of the promise, at least in the initial release window. The lack of voice search integration into other apps on the Fire TV was a main criticism many people -- including yours truly -- raised about the set-top box in initial reviews of the product.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">On Thursday, the company announced that it would be extending the device&#39;s voice search capabilities to a handful of third-party apps including Hulu Plus, Crackle and Showtime&#39;s app, Showtime Anytime, starting this summer.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">These three apps will join Vevo, which already allowed users to search for content by simply speaking into Amazon&#39;s remote. Amazon&#39;s own service, of course, also works with the voice search feature.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">If Amazon continues to add the capability to the catalog of apps already signed on to its platform -- particularly big partners such as Netflix or YouTube -- that will help it a lot as it battles the likes of Apple, Roku and Microsoft to control the living room. This announcement shows that while Fire TV still needs time to grow into all of its promises, Amazon seems to be moving at a good pace to improve the device.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">(Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved. Would you pay your own employees to quit?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos&#39;s move to do just that is getting a lot of attention, with coverage of the unusual human resources practice showing up everywhere from the Post to Time to USA Today last week after it was shared in his annual letter to shareholders. (Disclosure: Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s gotten so much attention in part because the practice is indeed pretty rare. Zappos, which Amazon acquired in 2009, has long made what it calls &quot;The Offer&quot; to its employees, saying to new workers that the company will pay them $2,000 to leave if they&#39;re not interested in staying. But while some companies may have adopted the practice since, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh&#39;s unusual management approach was so novel that when the Harvard Business Review wrote about it back in 2008, it quickly became one of the most popular posts on the site. (The Zappos offer started at just $100 but has risen over the years; Amazon offers its fulfillment center employees</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">$2,000 the first year the offer is made and raises the offer by $1,000 each year until it reaches $5,000.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But it shouldn&#39;t be so progressive or extraordinary when you stop and think about it. The most basic reason is also the most obvious one. As Bezos wrote in his shareholder letter, &quot;the goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and think about what they really want. In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they don&#39;t want to be isn&#39;t healthy for the employee or the company.&quot; The idea, in a sense, is to bribe people who don&#39;t love working there, don&#39;t feel they&#39;re a fit for the culture, or don&#39;t really like what they&#39;re doing with money to head for the exits. (An e-mail to Amazon to confirm details of the program was not immediately answered.)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Five thousand dollars here and there, after all, isn&#39;t that much when compared with what disengaged people can cost a company&#39;s bottom line. Gallup has shown that companies that have 9.3 &quot;engaged&quot; employees (those who are emotionally connected with their jobs and willing to go above and beyond) for every one &quot;disengaged&quot; employee saw 147 percent higher earnings per share on average in 2011-2012 when compared with their competitors. Meanwhile, employers with just 2.6 happy workers for every unhappy one saw earnings per share that was 2 percent lower than their competitors. Gallup estimates that &quot;active disengagement&quot; costs the United States $450 billion to $550 billion each year.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But that&#39;s not the only reason the idea is something more companies should adopt. For one, it has the potential to improve hiring upfront. If managers have to budget for a $5,000 quitting bonus for employees who don&#39;t stick around for the long haul, they might be more careful about truly hiring for fit rather than simply for a warm body. That&#39;s particularly the case for high-growth companies such as Zappos or Amazon that are experiencing very rapid expansion.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">At the same time, it could also save companies both risk and cost later on. Employers could potentially pay more than $2,000 or $5,000 in severance if they decided to lay off those disengaged workers in the future, rather than motivating them to leave of their own accord. They also risk fewer termination-related lawsuits if more of their workers choose to leave on their own.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">And that&#39;s just the tangible costs. If more disengaged folks are leaving on their own accord, rather than having to be pushed out in layoffs, there&#39;s less risk to employee morale. Layoffs are spirit-crushing events in any organization, even when they seem fair to the survivors and the good performers who are left behind. Avoiding more of them by encouraging the less devoted to leave earlier could take some of that risk away.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But probably the biggest benefit for a company to adopt the practice is that it shows all employees -- especially the really good performers or most dedicated ones -- that it&#39;s serious about protecting its culture. It doesn&#39;t want</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">people around who don&#39;t value the place, and it doesn&#39;t want people who don&#39;t love their jobs. And to prove it, it&#39;s willing to put its money behind it.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Read also:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Zappos says goodbye to bosses The three types of job burnout</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Like On Leadership?

We&#39;re typically staying within the time zone, and we&#39;re able to do things faster than national competitors in many cases.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The company was founded in 1986 as a document delivery service. These days, a network of trucks transports items — most commonly online purchases, but also items such as office supplies, medical equipment and wholesale pharmaceuticals — to different parts of the region. An online order that is fulfilled in Boston, for example, might be picked up by LaserShip and delivered to a home in Washington.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;We started as a local point-to-point service, and today we&#39;re delivering hundreds of thousands of packages a day to consumers across the East Coast,&quot; Dinneen said. &quot;It&#39;s been a very dynamic change for us.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">LaserShip has continue to spread on the East Coast. Last month, the company begin delivering to New Hampshire, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Delaware, expanding its service area by 44 percent and reaching an additional 8.5 million customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Dinneen would not disclose revenue or profit figures, but said the company&#39;s annual revenue grew by double digits last year. The e-commerce delivery business, the largest part of the company&#39;s business, grew more than 30 percent in 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Even so, the regional shipping industry comprises a small fraction of the $32 billion ground transportation industry. Last year, for example, regional shippers brought in a total of about $650 million in annual revenue, according to SJ Consulting Group, a transportation and logistics research firm.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">LaserShip landed in the small parcel business in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom.

The most recent outbreak occurred on the Royal Caribbean International vessel, which left Baltimore last Saturday for a seven-day cruise to the Bahamas, Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its Web site that about 100 passengers and crew members fell ill with vomiting and diarrhea. Martinez said a norovirus was</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">believed to be the cause.

A state investigation of five small tremors last month in the Youngstown area, in the Appalachian foothills, found the injection of sand and water that accompanies hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in the Utica Shale may have increased pressure on a small, unknown fault, said State Oil &amp; Gas Chief Rick Simmers.

Amazon was once an online bookstore and Google only a search engine. Uber executives appear on their way to expanding the service into a digital mesh, a logistical network that helps city dwellers get what they want where they want it. On Monday word arrived of UberRush, a bike courier system in New York.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">&quot;UberRush is like when Amazon first revealed it was no longer *just* a bookstore. Now comes a steady march toward global domination,&quot; Box chief executive Aaron Levie tweeted Monday night.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">We&#39;ve heard talk of this before. Kevin Roose of New York Magazine has written that Uber could be more valuable than Facebook. Uber investor Shervin Pishevar once described the potential this way: &quot;Uber is creating a digital mesh -- a power grid which goes within the metropolitan areas. After you have that power grid running, in everyone&#39;s pockets, there&#39;s lots of possibility of what you could build like a platform. Uber is incorporated in the empire-building phase.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">So could Uber&#39;s disruption of the taxi industry be just the beginning? A cynic would say every company talks big when an IPO may be on the horizon. Having a great story and interesting plans helps build interest from investors, who love to buy into growth companies. UberRush is the first significant step toward seeing if Uber can build out a digital mesh to help provides instant gratification of whatever city residents want.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Master data, or your company won&#39;t last.

All of that loading and unloading puts more stress on your device than just leaving it alone. Plus, iOS closes apps automatically as it needs more memory, so you&#39;re doing something your device is already doing for you.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s promise with its new set-top box, the Fire TV, is that it will make watching video from a variety of online sources easier. When it introduced the product earlier this week, Amazon made it clear in the presentation that it understands the frustrations and problems that consumers face when trying to choose a video to watch on their televisions.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But, with Fire TV, Amazon still hasn&#39;t quite managed to solve those problems.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">One of Amazon&#39;s biggest boasts about Fire TV is that it allows people to use their voices to search through content. You can search for a movie, genre or actor by hitting a microphone button on the Fire TV&#39;s remote and holding it down as you speak. The voice recognition isn&#39;t perfect, but it works as well or better than Apple&#39;s Siri or the voice-control capabilities on Microsoft&#39;s Xbox One -- about 12 of 15 queries offered up the right answer in one round of searching.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But voice search doesn&#39;t work in third-party apps such as YouTube or Netflix. That&#39;s not Amazon&#39;s fault, it&#39;s worth knowing before you imagine that Fire TV will eliminate the need to use the remote to hunt-and-peck your way through finding your favorite program.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Another drawback: The search feature doesn&#39;t dig deeply into the offerings outside Amazon&#39;s own catalog. So even if something is free to watch on Netflix, it probably won&#39;t show up as such in a Fire TV search. Instead, you&#39;d be directed to buy the title on Amazon or become an Amazon Prime member for $99 a year. Amazon touted its open ecosystem heavily in its presentation, but it&#39;s still difficult for users to take advantage of all those apps if they don&#39;t show up prominently in search. Like other Amazon hardware, the Fire TV is best used for consuming content in Amazon&#39;s own ecosystem, rather than outside of it.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon also has some work to do to build out its video catalog. These efforts take time and energy, of course, but Amazon&#39;s rookie status is clear when compared to others already in this space, such as Apple or</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">market-leading set-top box firm Roku. Notable gaps, such as HBO Go, will fill in over time, but consumers may want to wait to see how the partnerships play out before spending the $99 on the Fire TV.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Finally, gaming was described as a &quot;bonus&quot; feature for the Fire TV, signaling that Amazon isn&#39;t looking to take on Microsoft&#39;s Xbox One or Sony&#39;s PlayStation 4 any time soon. So, while the gaming features on the Fire TV are a nice distinguishing factor for the box, so far they can&#39;t compete with true, dedicated consoles.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s most impressive game so far is &quot;Sev Zero,&quot; a fun, engaging title made by the firm&#39;s in-house Amazon Game Studio. It&#39;s well-designed for a tweener market of gamers who are ready to graduate from the smartphone but aren&#39;t quite ready for a full console. But while the games on the Fire TV are solid, including some big titles, such as Mojang&#39;s Minecraft: Pocket Edition, they aren&#39;t a selling point on their own quite yet.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">What Amazon has in the Fire TV is a lot of potential. The intuitive search tool may eventually be a killer feature. The games could become a real draw over time, especially as Amazon Game Studios continues to evolve. And Amazon says it&#39;s planning to invest more heavily in content partnerships to expand its offerings.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But if you want a solution that comes out of the box, today, to solve all your set-top box problems, the Fire TV falls short.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">(Disclaimer: Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Amazon added another string or two to its bow this week, announcing not only that it&#39;s releasing a streaming video set-top box, but also using that device to take a major step into the wider world of video games.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The tech titan has dabbled in gaming in the past, thanks to its tablet business. The Amazon Kindle Fire, simply by virtue of being one of the most popular Android tablets on the market, has obviously picked up some users who play mobile games. Building on that audience, Amazon is using the Fire TV to address a gap in the gaming market -- the space between the phone or tablet and the full-fledged console.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Plenty of people play games nowadays, but don&#39;t necessarily consider themselves &quot;gamers,&quot; said Forrest analyst James McQuivey. Who are those people? Probably you or someone you know, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These are the people who &quot;say they&#39;re not gamers, but they just play some Candy Crush,&quot; he explained.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s actually a pretty sweet spot in the gaming space right now, since more people than ever are playing games on a regular basis but don&#39;t quite play enough to spend their cash on Sony&#39;s PlayStation 4, Microsoft&#39;s Xbox One or Nintendo &#39;s Wii U. So while Amazon&#39;s a little late to the party when it comes to video games, it&#39;s coming at just the right time for this audience.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The introduction also puts Amazon at the leading edge of a major trend in the future of gaming: streaming games.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Just a few years ago, playing games processed completely in the cloud meant dealing with frustrating, often unworkable delays for players -- even a few milliseconds make a huge different in some games. Even streaming the lighter games Amazon has packed into its 4.5 inch by 4.5 inch box would have been very difficult to for any console maker. But with technology advances and the fact that the games on Amazon&#39;s device aren&#39;t the graphics-intensive power hogs that tax dedicated consoles, the Fire TV seems more than able of handling that load.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Not that it&#39;s all super-casual stuff. &quot;Sev Zero,&quot; a launch title from Amazon&#39;s own in-house game studio looks and feels like a game that you could have seen in the early days of the Xbox 360, with a control scheme that all-but requires the company&#39;s dedicated, more traditional looking $40 controller:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">And connectivity is a key part of the new slate of Amazon games. Sev Zero&#39;s tower defense/third-person shooter mechanics are fun, but the game also has a unique approach to cooperative play. Players can control different aspects of the game using a Kindle Fire HDX tablet -- similar to the asymmetrical play we&#39;ve seen on the Wii U. And the Fire TV version of Minecraft, which is just the game&#39;s mobile &quot;pocket edition,&quot; also has a cool co-op feature that lets players on the same WiFi network collaborate in-game from any device that also has the mobile Minecraft app.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Finally, Amazon&#39;s also being smart about pricing. Executives said that the average price of a game will be just</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">$1.85 (though many of the title shown today are $6.99).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">They know that the games they&#39;re putting on Fire TV aren&#39;t the same as the big-budget titles that dominate the hardcore gaming space, so they&#39;re not even flirting with the $60 or $70 price tag of most new console titles. But they also know that some of the Fire TV&#39;s target audience is willing to put a little more cash to get a really good game -- just a tad more than the 99 cents or (maybe $2) people are willing to pay for a mobile game.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s just the right price for their target audience: those who may crave more than what they get from free games, but not too much more.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 172%;text-align: left;">Disclaimer: Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P.
