All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">District-based daily deal purveyor LivingSocial recorded a net loss of $650 million for 2012, according to a regulatory filing, putting a lackluster cap on 12 months that saw its once-meteoric rise slow significantly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A company initially known for rapid global expansion, LivingSocial began to retreat in 2012. The company closed some overseas operations, wrote down the value of others, reshuffled its executive ranks and let go 10 percent of its workforce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The financial results were reported in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from online retailer Amazon.com, which owns 29 percent of the firm. As a private company, LivingSocial does not disclose its own financial figures.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon said in the filing that the book value of its LivingSocial investment was $52 million as of Dec. 31. Amazon has invested as much as $200 million in the company during its period of speedy growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LivingSocial declined to comment on the filings. In an interview in December after the job cuts, LivingSocial spokesman Andrew Weinstein said, &quot;We&#39;ve had three years of extraordinary, nearly unprecedented growth, and this is a natural step to take a pause and make sure we are positioned for continued growth and profitability.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;These were painful decisions,&quot; Weinstein added, &quot;but they allow us to invest in critical areas like mobile and marketing in 2013. This industry is still very, very young, and we&#39;ve learned a lot about how to succeed in it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Young Internet companies can often take several years to reach profitability, and LivingSocial is no exception. The company&#39;s $650 million net loss in 2012 compares with a net loss of $499 million in 2011, when its pace of hiring and acquisitions was at its fastest.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There was a bright spot in Amazon&#39;s filing: LivingSocial&#39;s revenue, it reported, climbed to $536 million in 2012, more than double the $250 million it raked in the year before. That increase is largely attributed to daily deal revenue from the United States and successful overseas markets, such as South Korea, as well as its newer lines of business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A source close to LivingSocial said chief executive Tim O&#39;Shaughnessy told employees in a meeting last week that the company is expected to turn a profit sometime this spring. (O&#39;Shaughnessy is the son-in-law of Donald E. Graham, Washington Post Co. chairman and chief executive.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s very tough in eight lines of someone else&#39;s filings to be able to parse out what the business story is behind&quot; the loss, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of deference to Amazon, which did not return calls seeking comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Throughout the year, LivingSocial shuttered operations in the Middle East, Netherlands and Mexico. It then recorded an impairment charge of $579 million in the third quarter after several newly acquired companies proved to be less valuable than LivingSocial anticipated.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Even if it was a one-time write-down in value, it&#39;s another marker for how that business in general is struggling in the international arena,&quot; said Daniel Kurnos, an analyst at Benchmark, a market research firm.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In November, the company eliminated about 400 jobs in the United States, including 160 positions in the District.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LivingSocial has added new lines of business, pitching offers such as travel getaways, restaurant takeout and live events, but has yet to replicate the initial success it found delivering regular discounts to subscribers&#39; e-mail boxes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The question is: Does the market still have growth potential?&quot; Kurnos said. &quot;I think the answer is yes, but it may not be to the same level it was initially perceived to be.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Thomas Heath contributed to this report WP20130131livingsocial0131</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020130131e91v0004m</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 2 end/Image_004.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2">arts-post</a><a name="bookmark3">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Stephen King releases gun control essay</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Ron Charles 576 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">25 January 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Best-selling author Stephen King has just released a passionate call for greater gun control, titled &quot;Guns.&quot; In a coup for Amazon, the essay is available only through its Kindle Store for 99 cents.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King begins with a bitter recitation of the way school shootings are commonly reported in the news and the way politicians and lobbyists respond without, ultimately, disturbing the status quo. His list ends:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;21. Any bills to change existing gun laws, including those that make it possible for almost anyone in America to purchase a high-capacity assault weapon, quietly disappear into the legislative swamp.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;22. It happens again and the whole thing starts over.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Determined and at times profane, the 8,000-word essay confronts NRA members straight on: &quot;In the wake of the Sandy Hook shootings,&quot; King writes, &quot;gun advocates have to ask themselves if their zeal to protect even the outer limits of gun ownership have anything to do with preserving the Second Amendment as a whole, or if it&#39;s just a stubborn desire to hold onto what they have, and to hell with the collateral damage.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I have nothing against gun owners, sport shooters, or hunters,&quot; King writes, but &quot;how many have to die before we will give up these dangerous toys? Do the murders have to be in the mall where you shop? In your own neighborhood? In your own family?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the most personal section of his essay, King considers the current debate about the effect of violent media on young men. In the 1970s, he published a novel called &quot;Rage&quot; under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. It told the story of a high school kid who takes a gun to school, shoots his Algebra teacher and holds a class hostage. &quot;Rage&quot; sold only a few thousand copies, but starting in the late 1980s, King began to hear about teenage boys who were inspired by the book to commit similar crimes in their own schools. He does not think that his novel &quot;caused&quot; these young men to kill, but he says, &quot;I saw &#39;Rage&#39; as a possible accelerant.&quot; In response, he demanded that his publisher pull the book from publication.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He concludes with what he calls &quot;a trio of reasonable measures to curb gun violence&quot;:</p><ol id="l1"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Comprehensive and universal background checks.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Ban the sale of clips and magazines containing more than ten rounds.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Ban the sale of assault weapons such as the Bushmaster and the AR-15.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As one of the most popular authors in the world, King is immediately a powerful new presence in the gun control debate. But he repeatedly emphasizes the need for all sides to work together. Acknowledging the political difficulty of getting new restrictions passed, he notes that meaningful change will only happen &quot;if gun advocates get behind it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s Kindle Single platform is part of a dramatic shift in the publishing industry that allows authors to respond to current events quickly and in a longer form than most magazines and newspaper op-ed sections can accommodate. David Blum, an Amazon editor, said, &quot;King finished this essay last Friday morning, and by that night we had accepted it and scheduled for publication today.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">View Photo Gallery —The National Rifle Association becomes a focus of coverage whenever gun-related massacres take place in the United States.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon quietly toppled a monopoly this week by offering Apple users an alternate path to download music onto their devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A new Web-based music store, introduced Thursday, is specifically optimized for the Safari browser on the iPhone and iPod Touch. That means, for the first time, Apple users can download music to their devices without using the iTunes store. Instead, tracks purchased on the Web will get thrown over to Amazon&#39;s streaming Cloud Player app.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s a sly move that signals Amazon is focusing more heavily on its music business, especially when combined with the last week&#39;s unveiling of &quot;AutoRip,&quot; which provides some free digital copies of music with the purchase of CDs, earlier this month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It also means that Amazon has managed to get around Apple&#39;s standard fee for developers, which dictates that the Cupertino, Calif. firm gets a 30 percent cut of app sales and in-app purchases.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is one of the four companies that Google chairman Eric Schmidt has named as the major titans of tech, along with Apple, Facebook and — of course — Google. But Amazon is generally the quietest of the four, taking small steps to extend its reach as it adds plenty of service businesses to add to its core success as the Web&#39;s most recognizable retailer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not that Amazon hasn&#39;t been making waves, particularly when it comes to dealing with the content it offers on its site. Apple and Amazon were recently ordered to talk out their dispute over what Amazon calls its &quot;Appstore,&quot; which Apple argues is too close to the name of its own &quot;App Store.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And the company won quite the battle when the Department of Justice announced that it had found evidence that Apple and five book publishers had engaged in &quot;price-fixing&quot; to keep Amazon from undercutting the price of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-books. Four publishers have since settled with the government in the case, resulting in lower Amazon e-book prices and, in some cases, limited refunds on past purchases.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, in small bursts, Amazon has become a formidable force in the world of multimedia. Adding to its library of e-books and music, it&#39;s also built up an impressive catalog of streaming video titles and made partnerships to get its video player on game consoles and mobile devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In other words, it&#39;s creating an ever-growing pool of media that could eventually rival Apple&#39;s holdings on the iTunes and iBooks stores — and Amazon&#39;s already shown that it&#39;s willing to work around Apple&#39;s walled garden to get to its customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130121e91j00091</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark6">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark7">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Greece to probe ex-finance minister Amazon selling music for iPhone</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">480 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">18 January 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL A12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Some of your work may already be done for you.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon announced Thursday that it will give free digital versions of CD tracks to those who&#39;ve purchased physical discs from the online retailer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Called &quot;AutoRip,&quot; the service automatically adds MP3 versions of songs — 256 Kbps, for you music nerds — onto the company&#39;s Cloud Player. According to a release from Amazon, the service will work not only with new CD purchases, but any CD purchase made on Amazon since 1998.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Just for fun and context: A look at Billboard&#39;s chart of radio songs shows Chumbawamba&#39;s single &#39;Tubthumping&quot; was the number-one song this week in 1998.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon users can listen to their Cloud Player music anywhere they have an Internet connection, including on their computers and most smartphones and other mobile devices.

Amazon is rolling out an initial batch of 50,000 albums from several major record labels that will work with AutoRip, but it&#39;s not a comprehensive feature.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon still trails Apple&#39;s market-leading iTunes service and has been adding features to try to narrow that gap. In July, the company introduced a feature that lets users scan their iTunes or Windows Media Player libraries to import digital copies of those songs into Amazon&#39;s Cloud Player.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It also faces competition from companies such as Spotify or Pandora, which sell access to music rather than relying on the libraries that users already own.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Giving users digital copies of their historical purchases allows Amazon to distinguish itself in the ever-crowding world of online music and to leverage information that it already has on its consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130114e91b000vq</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark10">post-tech</a><a name="bookmark11">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Judge dismisses part of Apple ‘App Store’ claim against Amazon #thecircuit; A California judge has thrown out Apple’s claim that</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 564 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2 January 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Apple has said that the phrase immediately makes people think of its own &quot;App Store&quot; and that Amazon&#39;s name could be confusing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">New appointments: There have been some changes to the U.S. tech policy roster this week.

He will serve on the Federal Trade Commission. Wright, a professor at George Mason University, has said he will recuse himself from cases involving Google for two years, due to conflicts of interest. Wright was the director of research at the International Center for Law and Economics, which received funding from Google in the past.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Federal Communications commissioner Mignon Clyburn was also confirmed by the Senate and will serve another term.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avis acquires Zipcar: Car rental company Avis announced Wednesday that it is acquiring the car-sharing company Zipcar for $491 million, promising to boost Zipcar&#39;s growth and make the service available in more areas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We see car sharing as highly complementary to traditional car rental,&quot; said Avis Budget group chief executive officer and chairman Ronald L.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">America&#39;s obsession with digital tablets is driving a boon in e-book reading, a new survey shows, a trend that is dampening the appeal of printed books and shaking the centuries-old publishing business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The share of Americans who read e-books grew to 23 percent from 16 percent over the past year while the number of adults who read printed books fell to 67 percent from 72 percent, according to a study released Thursday by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The swift and dramatic shift in reading habits was brought on by the rising popularity of tablets and e-reader devices, which are now owned by one-third of the U.S. population 16 and older, the survey showed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And tablets - a category jump-started by Apple just two years ago - have surpassed e-readers such as Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s Nook or Amazon&#39;s Kindle as the preferred device for reading digital books, Pew found. One out of four</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-books is being read off a tablet, up from one out of 10 last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We haven&#39;t reached this point yet, but there are reasonable thoughts that the book experience of the future will be dramatically different than today,&quot; said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project. &quot;It will be a multimedia, highly social and maybe even incorporate a wiki experience.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tablets, such as the iPad, have sold at a record pace for a new hardware device, and consumer appetite for such gadgets shows few signs of abating. Other companies, trying to eat into Apple&#39;s market share, have quickly introduced lower-priced offerings such as the Google Nexus tablets and Amazon&#39;s Kindle Fire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those sales have made e-reading a breakaway business trend for the year, analysts say. IDC, a technology research firm, increased its forecast of tablet sales to 122.3 million for this year, saying the demand for mobile computing devices was much greater than anticipated.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The shift toward e-books is disrupting the economics of modern book publishing. Bookstore giant Borders went bankrupt last year, unable to maintain the cost of its bricks-and-mortar stores. Barnes &amp; Noble, meanwhile, is struggling to keep up with the transition to digital with its Nook.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So far, publishers have benefited by e-book sales. They get better margins for digital books because they don&#39;t have to be printed and distributed. Once downloaded, many titles can be shared and kept permanently.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the e-book phenomenon also has concentrated pricing power in the hands of far fewer retailers. E-book sales are dominated by Amazon. Earlier this year, major book publishers and Apple were accused of conspiring to lift prices of digital titles. Most of these companies have settled with the Justice Department, though Apple and Macmillan have vowed to fight the charges.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Experts don&#39;t expect digital books to overtake printed pages. Physical books work better as gifts, and photos and pictures look better on paper than in digital ink, said Jeremy Greenfield, editorial director at Digital Book World.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eventually e-books may become the dominant way that people read books, particularly as schools embrace tablets, experts say.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A host of public and private schools have adopted programs that put tablets into the hands of preschoolers. Textbook companies have launched partnerships with Apple and other device makers to put maps, history books and quizzes on apps. A growing number of libraries offer digital titles that can be borrowed, according to Pew.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">E-reading is being adopted much more quickly by wealthy adults, white and black, than it is by Hispanics, poorer and less-educated Americans, the survey found, highlighting a growing income rift among e-book readers and those who rely on print.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And how much are Americans reading? According to Pew, people 16 and older read an average of six books - either digital or paper - in the past year.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Pew interviewed 2,252 people 16 and older by phone for the survey.

But its plans for the future came into focus this year</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 514 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">28 December 2012 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has earned a reputation as a dark horse in the tech industry, walking its own road to success through low profit margins to long-term profits. It&#39;s not as splashy as Apple or Google. It doesn&#39;t have a social network. Its operating costs are huge. But Amazon&#39;s plans for the future came into focus this year as the company released new Kindle models and forged new partnerships to build out its streaming video catalog.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hardware commitment: Amazon rolled out more models of its low-cost Kindle Fire this year, as well as new versions of its Kindle e-readers. All adhered to the principle that Amazon has always had with its hardware: to make low-cost devices in order to hook users into the content over time. By offering tablets that can compete against 7-inch and 10-inch devices, Amazon has made it clear that it&#39;s taking the tablet space very seriously and intends to compete on all levels.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Taxation changes: The company&#39;s battle over sales taxes continued this year, with Amazon agreeing to collect sales taxes in California, Texas and Pennsylvania. The company had previously argued that it should be exempt from state sales taxes simply because it had distribution centers in those states.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has since lent its support to the idea of unified interstate sales tax, which it says will allow retailers to collect taxes easily without having to deal with a patchwork collection of tax law across the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Content partnerships: To support its hardware sales and its Web presence, Amazon partnered with several studios and television producers to provide a wider breadth of streaming content through its site. These included big partnerships with Discovery Communications, Epix and ESPN -- all of which added to its Netflix-like movie service, Amazon Instant Video. LivingSocial dragged down the company&#39;s profits, but most of the new alliances worked out in Amazon&#39;s favor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon also introduced a system that lets authors easily self-publish books and released its first mobile and desktop games through Amazon Game Studios. And it benefited from a case at the Justice Department that alleges Apple and major publishers were fixing prices on e-books; the company was able to drop prices on</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-books even further.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloud services: Amazon&#39;s Web Services power a good deal of the Web, and had its own triumphs and tribulations this year. AWS powered the Obama campaign&#39;s data collection tool, and the campaign has not been shy about mentioning how Amazon&#39;s cloud tools helped with data management throughout the election.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet Amazon also saw its fair share of public outages -- most recently when a service outage took out the Netflix movie service on Christmas Eve. Problems with AWS this year, particularly after storms, led to intermittent outages at several Web properties including Reddit, Instagram, Foursquare and HootSuite.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130103e8cs000zr</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark16">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark17">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">A Christmas Eve sans streaming video Holiday sales growth weakest since 2008</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">878 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26 December 2012 The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL A12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co.

He blamed an outage at the Herndon Amazon Web Services&#39; cloud computing center, starting at about 3:30 p.m. Monday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Service was fully restored Tuesday morning, although streaming was available to most users late Monday. &quot;We are investigating exactly what happened and how it could have been prevented,&quot; Evers said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He added: &quot;We are happy that people opening gifts of Netflix or Netflix capable devices can watch TV shows and movies and apologize for any inconvenience caused last night.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon also rents data storage and computing resources to other businesses and organizations. &quot;The service is now functioning correctly, and we&#39;re heads down making sure customers are operating smoothly,&quot; Amazon spokeswoman Tera Randall said in an e-mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. holiday retail sales this year grew at the weakest pace since 2008, when the nation was in a deep recession. This year, the shopping season was disrupted by bad weather and consumers&#39; rising uncertainty about the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A report that tracks spending on popular holiday goods, the MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, said Tuesday that sales in the two months before Christmas increased 0.7 percent compared with last year. Many analysts had expected holiday sales to grow 3 to 4 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2008, sales declined by 2 percent to 4 percent as the financial crisis that crested that fall dragged the economy into recession. Last year, by contrast, retail sales in November and December rose 4 percent to 5 percent, according to market research firm ShopperTrak. A 4 percent increase is considered a healthy season.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The SpendingPulse report is the first major snapshot of retail sales during the holiday season through Christmas Eve. A clearer picture will emerge next week as retailers such as Macy&#39;s and Target report revenue from stores open for at least a year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">l Volkswagen will vie with General Motors for the sales crown among foreign automakers in China next year, gaining share as Japanese carmakers led by Toyota struggle to recover amid a territorial dispute. VW, whose luxury Audi sedans are popular with Chinese bureaucrats, hasn&#39;t held the lead in the country since 2004 and will probably sell 2.7 million vehicles there next year to GM&#39;s 2.65 million, according to industry researcher JSC Automotive Consulting. Total vehicle sales may surpass 19 million units this year, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said Dec. 10. Japanese automakers will play catch-up in China as they step up efforts to regain market share lost after tensions soared over sovereignty of a group of uninhabited islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">l New York is providing $250 million for renewable energy generation projects to modernize the state&#39;s energy infrastructure. The funding is available through a competitive process overseen by the State Energy Research and Development Authority. The program is geared to wind, hydroelectric, solar, biomass and other clean-energy</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">resources. The projects that will get funding are to be announced by next summer.

The deal, Russia&#39;s largest ever, is set to vault Rosneft past PetroChina to become the world&#39;s biggest publicly traded oil producer by volume.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">l An Iranian semiofficial news agency said there has been another cyberattack by the sophisticated computer worm Stuxnet, this time on the industries in southern Iran.

Akhavan said Iranian computer experts were able to &quot;successfully stop&quot; the worm. Iran has repeatedly claimed defusing cyber worms and malware, including Stuxnet and Flame viruses that targeted the vital oil sector.

The most-wanted tablet, according to the survey, is the Google Nexus 7 with 33 percent, followed by a 30 percent slice of the market for Apple&#39;s iPad and a 24 percent share for the iPad mini.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One-fifth of shoppers said they&#39;re interested in getting themselves a tablet along with someone else.

As families amp up their gadget use, the industry&#39;s major competitors are looking for ways to reach out to the younger set.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nearly 70 percent of tablet owners with children under 12 allow their kids to use the devices for gaming, studying and entertainment, according to Nielsen. Nearly half of the kids use the devices to watch TV shows or movies, the study said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eyeing that market, and just in time for the holiday shopping season, Amazon announced an unlimited multimedia subscription service for kids 3 to 8 through its Kindle Fire tablet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The service, called &quot;Kindle Free Time Unlimited,&quot; offers curated, kid-friendly movies, games and books. Kids control their own libraries and the buffet-style pricing prevents surprise charges on their parents&#39; bills. Parents with up to six kids pay around $10 per month for the service - prices can drop to as low as $2.99 per child per month if users subscribe to Amazon&#39;s Prime service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Amazon knows how to get people to spend more money, even if it&#39;s just a few dollars a month,&quot; said James McQuivey, an analyst for Forrester Research. &quot;By ensuring that a whole library of content is freely available, the hope is that parents will get addicted to the age-appropriate babysitter.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon isn&#39;t the only gadget maker vying to sell the family tablet. Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s Nook has been a hit with parents because of its wide catalogue of picture books and limited video selection. Apple can offer kid-focused films, thanks to the children&#39;s section that Netflix recently added to its iPad app. But Amazon, which sells games, books and videos, can offer a wider variety of titles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The service &quot;gives kids the freedom to explore age-appropriate content on their own,&quot; Peter Larsen, vice president of Amazon&#39;s Kindle department, said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To appeal to privacy-conscious parents, Amazon will not show advertisements or social media to kids using the service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;It&#39;s great that it will be an ad-free service,&quot; said privacy advocate Jeffrey Chester, who runs the Center for Digital Democracy. But he&#39;d like more information on Amazon&#39;s data collection and use policies for the service. &quot;We call on Amazon to make its service not just ad-free - but data-profiling free when it comes to kids,&quot; Chester said.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon could not immediately be reached for comment on how it will use data from FreeTime for marketing.

KidsPost has a few ideas for you.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">iGuy turns iPads into creatures with arms and legs. His squishy arms make perfect handles as you carry him from room to room. He can stand up or lie down on his cushioned back, which has a hole for the iPad&#39;s camera. iGuy comes in five colors and fits all versions of the iPad. (Speck. $39.99. Available at Amazon.com, Target and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wal-Mart.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Big Grips is another super sturdy iPad option. The case comes in two parts: a frame and a stand. Use the stand if you like your iPad propped up, or take it out if you prefer the iPad flat on a table or on the floor. Both parts are made from squishy foam and protect the device from bumps and scratches. Big Grips comes in several colors and two sizes, depending on which iPad version you own. (KEM Ventures. $49.95; $34.95 for frame only.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Available at Amazon.com.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Older kids will appreciate the stylish and less bulky Verso Scholar and OMG! cases. The Scholar looks like a mini composition book, with its black-marble cover and its blue lines inside. (Mom and Dad will probably catch on that it&#39;s not your English journal.) Verso&#39;s OMG! looks as though it&#39;s covered in that popular design material: duct tape. The bright green or pink cover also feels as though it&#39;s covered with the tape, but luckily it won&#39;t come off. Both styles come in three sizes and fit many seven- to 10-inch e-readers and tablets, including the Kindle Fire, the Nook HD and the iPad Mini. (LightWedge. $39.99-$49.99. Available at Amazon.com, Versostyle.com; selected styles at Office Max, Radio Shack and Wal-Mart.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20121202kd-newappside2</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020121202e8c200064</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark26">A-Section</a><a name="bookmark27">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Losses grow for Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s Nook</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Phil Wahba 497 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30 November 2012 The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL A15</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co.

But the company, which operates 689 stores, sold fewer Nook units at its stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Nook business has been a driver of revenue since it was introduced in 2009 as readers have bought more digital books, but product development and marketing costs to keep the devices competitive with Amazon&#39;s Kindle have made it an expensive project.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chief executive William Lynch told investors on a conference call that he stuck by his forecast that the Nook segment&#39;s loss would narrow this fiscal year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Halfway through the fiscal year, the loss has increased 6.1 percent, to $108.1 million, as the company has invested in developing the devices and prepared for its first international expansion to Britain.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new Nook HD and Nook HD+ tablets were launched after its fiscal second quarter ended Oct. 27 and are taking on the Amazon Kindle devices and Apple&#39;s new iPad Mini.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble said Nook device sales over the four-day Thanksgiving weekend - one of the busiest times of the year for U.S. retailers - doubled from last year, helped by promotions by Wal-Mart and Target.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both stopped selling Kindles this year. Amazon reported similar growth for its devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Barnes &amp; Noble is holding on to market share at the expense of profit,&quot; said Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom. The investments to keep pace with rivals will make it hard for the Nook unit to turn a profit, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lynch said Barnes &amp; Noble has hung onto its 25-30 percent share of the U.S. e-books market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nook accounts for 8.5 percent of total revenue. In August, early in the quarter, Barnes &amp; Noble lowered prices on several Nook devices. In another worrisome sign longer term, Wahlstrom noted that same-store sales for books fell over the holiday weekend.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overall revenue in the quarter slipped 0.4 percent, to $1.88 billion, while retail sales, still its biggest segment by far, fell 2.9 percent, to $996 million, hurt by flat same-store sales and a drop in sales on its Web site.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20121130barnes1130</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020121130e8bu0001e</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 2 end/Image_006.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark28">Streaming video market primed for consolidation, billionaire says</a><a name="bookmark29">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Cliff Edwards;Michael White;— Bloomberg News 687 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 November 2012 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co.

The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company posted its biggest gain since January after Icahn said deep- pocketed competitors such as Amazon.com and Verizon Communications were potential suitors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Netflix has been the most aggressive player in establishing the market for online video, building a subscriber base of 25.1 million U.S. customers and nearly 5 million internationally. Its dominant hold positions the company as the biggest prize in a market that Icahn sees as ripe for consolidation. As consumers turn to the Internet for TV shows and movies, rivals must spend billions to overtake Netflix, or pay to acquire it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;This could be a great jumping-off point for them,&quot; Icahn said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. &quot;There&#39;s so many possible combinations.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Icahn&#39;s investment includes options for 4.29 million shares, according to the filing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Netflix surged 14 percent to $79.24 on Wednesday in New York, its highest close in more than three months. It closed Friday at $76.90.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We have many shareholders, now including Mr. Icahn, and we&#39;re always open to their perspective on how to build on our success,&quot; Jonathan Friedland, a Netflix spokesman, said Thursday in an e-mailed statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Robert Varettoni, a spokesman for New York-based Verizon, declined to comment on whether the telecommunications company is interested in Netflix. Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman in Seattle, didn&#39;t respond to a telephone request for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Netflix is far ahead of its rivals. The company turned its DVD-by-mail service into the top subscription streaming destination for movies and TV shows, with a $7.99 monthly fee for unlimited use, doling out billions for rights to films and television shows.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hulu — owned by News Corp., Walt Disney and Comcast — said last month that it had 2 million paid users of its Hulu Plus service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, the world&#39;s biggest online retailer, ties its video subscription to the $79-a-year Prime service, which offers free shipping. Prime had 3 million to 5 million customers in October 2011, with a goal to reach as many as 10 million by next October, people familiar with the matter said in February. In September, it added movies from Viacom&#39;s Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lions Gate Entertainment in a deal with the Epix</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pay-TV channel.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Verizon and Coinstar, owner of the Redbox video kiosks, plan to start their Redbox Instant service by year-end. The venture will combine subscription streaming, video-on-demand and the sale of digital copies with access to Redbox DVD rental machines.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Icahn, an activist who has pressed for buyouts and management changes at some companies he held stakes in, praised Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings for expanding internationally and developing original series. In a filing, Icahn said the company may have appeal to larger buyers.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I think Reed Hastings is a smart guy,&quot; said Icahn, who had invested in the competing Blockbuster video-rental store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A buyer for Netflix would face numerous challenges. Domestic subscriber growth is slowing, the company is losing money from its international expansion and it has at least $5 billion in content obligations, including $2.1 billion over the next 12 months, according to its Oct. 23 third-quarter report.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those multiyear commitments would make it difficult to cut costs, said Eric Wold, a B. Riley &amp; Co. analyst in San Francisco who recommends selling the stock.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;You are getting a significant subscriber base, but subscribers can cancel at any time without a penalty, so there&#39;s no long-term security there,&quot; Wold said. &quot;They have content, but 80 percent is not exclusive, so you can get the content from someone else at a cheaper price.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020121103e8b3005bp</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark30">Amazon expected to post a loss on revenue gains; Amazon’s revenue is expected to climb but operating costs will keep it in the red, analysts say.</a><a name="bookmark31">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 480 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">25 October 2012 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is set to report earnings Thursday as the company gears up for holiday sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The online retailer takes in a lot of cash through sales, but it also pays a lot in operating costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The consensus among analysts is that Amazon will post revenue of $13.9 billion, a double-digit increase from the same period last year. Earnings per share are expected to drop by around 7 cents, compared with a 14-cent gain in the third quarter of 2011.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In July, Amazon said it expected to make about $13 billion sales revenue and forecast an operating loss between</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$50 million and $350 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer will be making a big holiday push this season to boost sales of its new line of Kindle tablets, which come in 7- and 9-inch sizes. The company also has a 4G model, which is the same price as the basic, WiFi-only model of Apple&#39;s iPad.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company sells its Kindle devices at or near cost — according to an interview the company&#39;s chief executive Jeff Bezos gave to All Things Digital. To profit from the hardware, Amazon needs to persuade users to buy access to its a la carte video service, books and products on the Kindles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consumers aren&#39;t expected to spend much more this Christmas season than they did last year. According to a report from The Washington Post, average shoppers are expected to spend only $9 more than the $740 they shelled out last year. Retailers are preparing aggressive deals to lure shoppers into their stores in the sluggish economy, the report said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Online retailers have been faring better in the slow economy than many of their brick-and-mortar rivals. As the Associated Press noted, eBay reported strong earnings with net income up 22 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, Best Buy announced Thursday that it expects store sales to continue declining and offered a weak outlook for the third quarter ahead of its Nov. 20 earnings release. The retailer is also restructuring, replacing its</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. president and the executive vice president of its U.S. operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Aggressive moves from Amazon, such as plans for same-day shipping, have the potential to eat even further into brick-and-mortar sales — even if the company has to start charging sales tax and loses its price advantage in the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company is certainly not slowing down, announcing Thursday that it is releasing a Kindle app for Microsoft&#39;s new operating system that will come pre-loaded on Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung Windows 8 devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Related stories:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wal-Mart drops Amazon Kindle products</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon gets final okay on 4G Kindle, report says </a><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" target="_blank">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020121025e8ap005mt</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark32">Apple reveals iPad mini; Wall Street unimpressed</a><a name="bookmark33">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 546 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24 October 2012 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple introduced a shrunken version of its popular iPad on Tuesday as it faces increasing pressure from Amazon and other companies that have been winning customers with smaller tablets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The launch of the iPad mini was a notable shift for the tech giant, which has tended to dictate design to consumers rather than respond to their appetites.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Its late founder, Steve Jobs, had once derided small tablets, joking that they would need to come with sandpaper so people could file their fingers down to use them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Apple has watched its market share in tablets fall in recent years. The iPad now accounts for 60percent of tablet sales, down from more than 80percent in 2010. Over that time, Amazon and Google have released smaller tablets, and a bevy of others are on their way before the holiday shopping season.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like in computers and laptops, Apple strove to maintain its position as a high-quality computer manufacturer whose products cost more than the competition. The basic version of the iPad mini is tagged at $329, well above Amazon&#39;s $199 Kindle Fire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple&#39;s strategy didn&#39;t seem to agree with Wall Street. As soon as the price was unveiled, a sell-off in the firm&#39;s stock accelerated. Shares ended down about 3.3percent, dropping more than $20.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Michael Allenson, a tech analyst at Maritz Research, said he&#39;s having trouble identifying who will buy the iPad mini.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Who&#39;s going to buy it? And what are they going to use it for? I don&#39;t see that it&#39;s differentiated enough,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;When I look at the data from our tablet research, it tells us that people are looking to have fewer devices. It&#39;s a lot of choices that Apple&#39;s put in front of people. The question is, are they going to get more people through the door?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The iPad mini has a 7.9-inch display, smaller than the iPad&#39;s 9.5-inch screen but larger than others in the mini&#39;s 7-inch-screen class. It weighs just over two-thirds of a pound. The new tablet begins shipping Nov. 2.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was just one of several hardware products featured at Apple&#39;s event in San Jose.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company also released a fourth-generation version of its iPad — with a faster processor, a new type of power cord and the ability to tap into the fastest cellular networks around the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The unexpectedly quick release did not sit well with some people who shelled out $499 or more for the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">third-generation iPad a mere seven months ago. Some went to online forums and technology Web sites to voice their displeasure.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple also unveiled updates to its traditional computer line. An updated iMac, a desktop, now measures just 5millimeters thick. Executives also touted an upgraded $599 Mac Mini — a tiny desktop computer — and a new</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$1,699 13-inch MacBook Pro that has an extra-sharp &quot;retina&quot; display.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sarah Rotman Epps, a tech analyst at Forrester Research, was encouraged by the new iPad mini.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;In some ways, it&#39;s cannibalizing its own potential sales, but it&#39;s also expanding Apple&#39;s addressable market,&quot; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020121024e8ao000p3</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark34">Amazon Web Services outage hits Reddit, Airbnb, imgur; AWS outage hits popular sites Monday</a><a name="bookmark35">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 234 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23 October 2012 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co.

But there&#39;s a far less exciting reason for why it&#39;s been tough for some users to get to the site. Reddit, Airbnb and Imgur on Monday were been affected by a hiccup at Amazon Web Service&#39;s servers in northern Virginia.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Erik Martin, Reddit&#39;s general manager, confirmed that the downtime appears to be the result of a &quot;Amazon issue.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s own service dashboard shows that a &quot;small number&quot; of its storage units are having &quot;degraded performance.&quot; According to Compuware&#39;s Outage Analyzer, at least 60 domains may be affected by the outage. The others include Mojang games Minecraft and Scrolls.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The sites aren&#39;t down for all users, but enough people are having problems for the jokes to fly about productivity going up across the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Reddit is currently down,&quot; came a tweet from PBS Digital Studios. &quot;In other news, global productivity today has soared by 5000%.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An AWS outage in July took down sites such as Netflix, Instagram and Pinterest after a major storm hit the Washington region.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Related stories:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services &#39;operating normally&#39; after storm outage </a><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" target="_blank">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020121022e8am00691</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark36">Microsoft, Google eye mobile holiday sales; Microsoft and Google have a lot to prove as they battle Apple, Amazon</a><a name="bookmark37">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 636 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">18 October 2012 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microsoft and Google have a plan for this holiday season: To reach every gadget-happy shopper seeking a new smartphone or tablet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companies are on different sides of a rapid industry shift away from desktops and toward mobile devices. Their holiday plans will be clearer after the companies report third quarter earnings Thursday, but their strategy is part of a larger search for continued relevance as consumers move increasingly to hand-held devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Headed into the holiday season, Microsoft is trying to mount a comeback and planning to start a new era as the purveyor of mobile devices and services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consumers will get their first look at the new Microsoft next week, when the company launches a new operating system and its own Surface tablet — just one of several Windows tablets coming to compete with Apple&#39;s market-leading iPad this fall. It&#39;s also working on the launch of a new smartphone operating system, Windows Phone 8. Nokia, Samsung and HTC have already announced new smartphones for the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It&#39;s not hard to guess why Microsoft is making the shift. Despite a massive marketing effort for ultrabook laptops earlier this year, the personal computer market is expected to shrink this year for the first time in over a decade, according to a recent study from the market research firm IHS iSuppli.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales of smartphones, meanwhile, are going through the roof. There are now more than 1 billion smartphones in the world, according to a study from Strategy Analytics, and the sector&#39;s growth means that there are still plenty of customers for the taking.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The next billion smartphones will be sold and used in just a few short years, not the decade plus that it took to reach the first billion,&quot; said Alex Spektor, an analyst who worked on the report. &quot;All companies involved in the mobile space will be very actively competing.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The forecast is also bright for the tablet market, with International Data Corporation estimating 117.1 million units will ship by the end of the year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google seems well-positioned to ride out the shift. It even briefly passed Microsoft as the second-most valuable technology company last month. The company&#39;s stock has grown around 30 percent since July, while Microsoft&#39;s has remained almost the same.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While it has seen how much it can charge advertisers for every click made by a user decline, the volume of advertising has grown. With its Android operating system activating 1.3 million units a day, according to the company, Google powers most of smartphones and tablets and boosts the company&#39;s profit stream through its mobile application store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The firm is also now producing its own hardware, a small tablet called the Nexus 7. Headed into the holiday season, Google is expected to release another phone and tablet under its Nexus brand name.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If it does, it will come into a holiday market crowded with consumer options. The new tablets are not only competing against Apple&#39;s iPad and Amazon&#39;s Kindle Fire line, but also retailers launching their own devices in the hopes of catching the trend. Barnes &amp; Noble has seen modest success with its Nook tablet, and has launched a larger version that takes advantage of the company&#39;s new partnerships. Best Buy announced last week that it&#39;s also jumping into the mix with a basic tablet, which is expected to cost around $250.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All are chasing Apple, which commands 60 percent of the tablet market with its iPad and is expected to launch a smaller version of the tablet next week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">The ultimate arbiters will be gadget hungry holiday shoppers. </a><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" target="_blank">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020121018e8ai000xe</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark38">Best Buy tablet, Insignia Flex, could cost around $250; Best Buy may price its tablet to be competitive with the larger Kindle Fire tablets</a><a name="bookmark39">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 368 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">18 October 2012 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co.

Apple&#39;s iPad, which leads the tablet market, starts at $499.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The report comes just a week after the electronics retailer announced its tablet debut on Facebook under the company&#39;s Insignia brand. The company already makes home audio equipment, televisions, digital picture frames and tablet accessories under the brand.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Insignia Flex will run Google&#39;s Android Ice Cream Sandwich — the second-latest version of the operating system — and will have a dual-core 1GHz processor. It also has a 10-hour battery life.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company hasn&#39;t released many specifics, but the details it has released don&#39;t seem to present a very credible threat to the iPad or, really, even the Kindle Fire</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All in all, the Flex seems to be a tablet aimed at consumers who want a larger tablet for browsing and reading, but not much more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That makes the rumored price particularly curious, as the best strategy for Best Buy would be to head for the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$200-and-under crowd. On the other hand, Best Buy certainly hasn&#39;t shown that it has the content of an Apple, Amazon or even Barnes and Noble to offer to its customers, so it would have no clear way to turn a profit on a tablet if it sells the device at cost.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Related stories:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What you should know about Microsoft Surface pre-orders</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">AP: Best Buy starts online price-match program as holiday season begins Amazon gets final okay on 4G Kindle, report says </a><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" target="_blank">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020121017e8ah002jp</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark40">Amazon gets final okay on 4G Kindle, report says; Pre-orders are open on the 4G version of Amazon’s Kindle Fire after the Federal Communications Commission gave its approval for the device to operate on &zwnj; U.S. networks.</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 312 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11 October 2012 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co.

As expected, the news comes with plenty of time for Amazon to meet its target launch date of Nov. 20.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The devices are direct competitors to Apple&#39;s iPad line, escalating a battle between the technology industry&#39;s largest companies in the tablet space.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Apple are all making big holiday pushes for their tablets. Each have been aggressively building out their software and content partnerships for movies, books, TV shows and music to offer customers a compelling reason to buy their tablets and lock in to their content systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has seen a lot of success in the smaller tablet market with the 7-inch version of the Kindle Fire. Last month, Amazon launched a remade version of the Fire with an HD screen for $199. It also launched an 8.9-inch, WiFi only version of the Kindle Fire for $299.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The 4G version of the Kindle Fire has an 8.9-inch screen and starts at $499. A 64 GB version of the tablet will cost $599. Buying the tablet without advertising will add $15 to the tablet&#39;s cost.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Related stories:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Rosenwald, Md.: Md. man battles gunfire to save stolen Kindle Wal-Mart drops Amazon Kindle products</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">Review Roundup: Early takes on Kindle Fire HD </a><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" target="_blank">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020121011e8ab0060t</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark42">Apple’s mini iPad: Three things it needs; Apple’s coming late to the smaller tablet market</a><a name="bookmark43">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 615 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11 October 2012 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple is expected to send out invitations for an iPad mini event Wednesday — if you want to believe the rumor mill, that is.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s coming late to a market where Amazon&#39;s Kindle Fire, Barnes and Noble&#39;s Nook Tablet and Google&#39;s Nexus 7 are already fighting it out. But Apple will likely be able to compete with those tablets just by being Apple. As Sterne Agee&#39;s Shaw Wu said in an analyst&#39;s note in April, most smaller tablets &quot;have a tough enough time&quot; competing with iPad models.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are, however, are a few things that Apple should focus on to make the iPad mini a success:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Low price: This is likely the most critical point for Apple to get right. Its cachet with consumers means Apple likely won&#39;t have to go as low as its competitors, so there won&#39;t be a $199 iPad to match Amazon and Google. The sweet spot would be at or under $300. If it&#39;s within $50 or $75 of those tablets, the iPad could have a strong pull on those considering competitors&#39; devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Plus, at that price point Apple may be able to convert some of the customers considering the $199 iPod Touch or the $399 iPad 2 to pick up its smaller tablet instead.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Usability: Apple almost never disappoints when it comes to building devices that have just the right weight and balance, which will be critical for a mini that needs to be easy to use with either one or two hands. Still, Apple will have to focus closely on how the device feels in hand and, most importantly, its weight.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company will also have to make sure that it&#39;s not limited by the screen size, the very reason its late</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">co-founder Steve Jobs cited in his outspoken criticism of smaller tablets. To best use the smaller space, the user interface will have to be made for the smaller iPad, and not simply scaled down from the full iPad. In an ideal world, that would apply not only to the apps that developers make but also to things such as the keyboard.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Battery life: Smaller tablets are often bought as replacements for e-readers, which explains why Amazon and Barnes and Noble were the first major players in the market. E-readers have the unique ability to keep a charge for weeks, which make them good commute or road trip companions. A smaller iPad won&#39;t have to have that kind of battery life, but it will have to be able to last through a day of moderate to heavy use to compete.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speculation around a smaller iPad has been swirling for months, with expectations that it will have a 7.85-inch screen and run on the same A5 chip as the iPad 2. It is not expected to have the same resolution quality as the new iPad, the Wall Street Journal reported, which means it may not have the &quot;retina display&quot; Apple has put on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. The Guardian also reports that the device will be Wi-Fi only.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As is usual for Apple, the company hasn&#39;t breathed a hint of an official confirmation or denial that the product even exists, so it&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess whether the mounting pile of evidence adds up to anything.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Related stories:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Google, Samsung plan Nexus 10 tablet, CNET report says HTC profits take a dive in a tough market</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Samsung can sell the Galaxy Tab 10.1 again</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020121010e8aa002b6</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 2 end/Image_007.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark44">Style</a><a name="bookmark45">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">For fans of e-reading, an upstart option</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kevin Nance 1,524 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7 October 2012</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL T12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Withphysical books being overtaken in the marketplace by their digital counterparts, dozens of companies are scrambling to secure their share of attention - and revenue - in the lucrative e-book market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Much of the battle is being waged by retailers competing with proprietary e-reading technologies such as Amazon&#39;s Kindle, Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s Nook, Apple&#39;s iPad and iPhone and Kobo&#39;s range of e-reading apps and devices. Another corner of the playing field is curation - the process of recommending books, usually with the help of algorithms that identify titles similar to the ones you&#39;ve already browsed or purchased; online booksellers such as Amazon and BN.com are finding their turf encroached upon by non-retailers such as Goodreads.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then there&#39;s the parallel world of book-related discussion on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and other</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">social-networking sites (not to mention blogs and the digital arms of traditional print media such as newspapers and magazines), most of them competing for hits and advertising dollars.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Joining the literary scrum this month is ZolaBooks.com, a venture whose strategy is to combine all three of the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-book world&#39;s major market functions - retailing, curation and social-networking - in an ambitious bid to become a one-stop destination for book lovers on the Web.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;So far, no one has translated what readers do in the real world - drawing on a wide network of friends, institutions and trusted tastemakers - in an online environment,&quot; says Zola chief executive Joe Regal, a former New York literary agent who co-founded the site a year ago with Michael Strong, a key architect of Sotheby&#39;s online. &quot;Our question was: What do people want to do in terms of seeking out and buying books, and how do we help them do that online?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We know that people want to network with their friends around books, and so we&#39;re creating the first social network that only does books. We also know that people are influenced by tastemakers who can lead them to the next good book to read. There are a lot of places to get that information, but nobody&#39;s put them all together in one place - a place where, by the way, you can also buy the book.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consumers will be guided by Zola&#39;s trademarked &quot;curation engine&quot; that uses rating and purchase-based algorithms along with expert input from book critics, bloggers, authors, publishers and booksellers, whom they can &quot;follow&quot; a la Twitter. &quot;If you read a book that you like and then see that Ron Charles of The Washington Post gave it a good review, then you can follow Ron Charles to see what else he recommends,&quot; Regal says. &quot;If you&#39;re a fan of crime novels, and notice that [the owner of the Mysterious Bookshop in New York] Otto Penzler blogs about those books, you can follow him. Or you might follow the recommendations of your local indie bookseller, or your local library or NPR.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Previewable in beta form, Zola plans a soft launch Wednesday, offering e-book exclusives including &quot;Making Mavericks,&quot; a memoir by the Northern California surfing legend Richard &quot;Frosty&quot; Hesson (a movie version starring Gerard Butler opens Oct. 26), and Gordon Dahlquist&#39;s &quot;The Chemickal Marriage,&quot; the conclusion of a fantasy trilogy. Subsequent exclusives will include the first e-book edition of Audrey Niffenegger&#39;s mega-selling &quot;The Time Traveler&#39;s Wife,&quot; with a new chapter by the author, who is also a Zola investor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">E-books from hundreds of publishers, including the Big Six (Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin Group, Random House and Simon &amp; Schuster), are scheduled to be available in a phased rollout over</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the next few weeks. (E-books sold on Zola will be the same as those from other e-retailers, and will be priced roughly the same, with bestsellers costing an average of just over $11.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Usable on all devices</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another keystone of Zola&#39;s strategy is to sidestep the proprietary e-reader problem - which forces readers to choose a particular device - by marketing digital books that can be read on all e-readers, not just one.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Zola reader will work as an HTML5 applet on Web-enabled devices; the reader uses cloud technology to store the e-books, which can be downloaded onto any device. Apps will be available for the iPad and other tablets and devices, but the reading experience will be essentially the same.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When customers decide to change devices, they won&#39;t have to re-purchase the book, he adds. Customers just log onto Zola and upload the book to the new device, which opens on the last page read on the previous device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Along the way, Zola - funded by about 20 investors, mostly from the book industry and named for the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19th-century French novelist known for his socially progressive politics - gives its customers an easy way to help keep independent bookstores from following major chains such as Borders into extinction. In return for in-store promotion, Zola provides the bookstores with home pages (&quot;storefronts,&quot; in Zola-speak), then forks over 60 percent of the net profit from every book sold there. Zola users can even &quot;declare allegiance&quot; to their favorite indie stores, funneling most of the profit from their e-book purchases back to their own neighborhoods.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unlike IndieCommerce, the American Booksellers Association&#39;s non-exclusive e-retailing program originally partnered with Google (and more recently with Kobo), membership in Zola is free to booksellers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;There&#39;s no downside that I can see so far,&quot; says Katie Fransen, the book buyer at One More Page Books in Arlington. &quot;We&#39;ve been looking to get into the e-book market, but it costs quite a bit of money to use IndieCommerce [$175 per month]. The key thing is that people are going to have to get used to a new platform.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Revenue model</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With that kind of profit-sharing, how can Zola earn revenue? &quot;With scalable technology, social marketing and no physical infrastructure to support - retail space, etc. - we can be profitable on slimmer margins than traditional bricks-and-mortar stores,&quot; Regal says.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zola has been embraced by many publishers, some of whom - including Macmillan, which has publicly feuded with Amazon over e-book pricing - regard it as a way to preserve traditional book-distribution channels while expanding the market for digital books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Joe comes from our community, and he&#39;s trying to create a site that&#39;s a combination of Goodreads and Amazon, a destination site where people can buy books and also hang out and exchange ideas,&quot; says Morgan Entrekin, president and publisher of Grove/Atlantic. &quot;I also love the fact that he&#39;s offering independent booksellers a way to get into the e-book business, because whatever we can do to keep independent bookstores around, I&#39;m in favor of.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;It&#39;s important to have a diversity of distribution channels, but what we&#39;ve been seeing is a concentration of those channels in just a few places. They can do great things, but I think it would be unhealthy, and maybe dangerous, if Amazon or Barnes &amp; Noble or Google or Apple had complete control of the e-book market.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zola&#39;s path forward has been complicated by Kobo&#39;s announcement in August of a new partnership with the ABA, though Regal is untroubled. &quot;We are delighted that the ABA has partnered with Kobo to provide a device to stores who want to sell devices,&quot; he says. &quot;Because Zola books can be read on all Web-enabled devices - Kobo devices as well as devices many readers already own, such as iPads, Nooks and Kindles - this is great news for everyone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We also think that while a lot of stores believe a device is their salvation, the future is all about tablets. That&#39;s where the numbers are, and the iPad mini is coming this season, and Google&#39;s Nexus is looking like a winner. So the job is to convince the stores who want devices that having a partner whose services cross all devices is the way to go.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A more serious snag in Zola&#39;s business plan was the Justice Department&#39;s ongoing lawsuit against Apple and several major publishers over alleged collusion in the pricing of e-books, which had the effect of delaying retailing agreements between Zola and the three publishers (Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon &amp; Schuster) who settled.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those agreements are still being negotiated, which led Zola to scrap a big-bang launch in favor of a phased rollout.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We realized that there&#39;s no need to wait for a moment when we have 100 percent of all e-books - we can roll them in as we go,&quot; Regal says. &quot;I personally love the idea of sudden transformation, from nothing to something, but the steadier, more patient approach of gradual growth might be smarter. I do feel extremely confident that we&#39;ll offer the vast majority of e-books from most publishers by the end of this year.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Nance is a freelance writer.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">WP20121007ss-zola1007</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020121007e8a70007u</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 2 end/Image_008.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark46">Nook GlowLight gets a price cut; Amazon Paperwhite gets rave reviews; Barnes &amp; Noble is taking a stand in the e-reader race</a><a name="bookmark47">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 422 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 October 2012 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012, The Washington Post Co.

The reader, formerly $139, will now cost $119.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That, by some amazing coincidence, is exactly the price of the entry-level version of Amazon&#39;s light-up reader, the Kindle Paperwhite.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reviewers were raving about the Paperwhite in write-ups Monday morning and calling the device, to quote NBC News, &quot;The king of e-readers.&quot; Time&#39;s Harry McCracken gave Amazon&#39;s reader top marks, saying that it&#39;s the &quot;best product Amazon has sold under the Kindle moniker,&quot; with particular praise for the reader&#39;s high-contrast screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wired&#39;s Roberto Baldwin said that the Paperwhite beats out the Nook with GlowLight, in part, because it lights the screen in a much more uniform way. It&#39;s not perfect, Baldwin says, but the Paperwhite&#39;s screen makes the reader well worth the price. He does, however, fault the reader for not having physical page-turn buttons and for being ad-supported.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those ads, which Amazon calls Special Offers, are a sticking point for some people — a fact Barnes &amp; Noble hasn&#39;t ignored.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In its press release, Barnes &amp; Noble takes a not-so-gentle jab at the competition, by pointing out that its e-reader comes without ads, even at its lower price. Losing the ads on the Paperwhite costs an additional $20. The Nook, Banes &amp; Noble notes, also comes with a wall-charger while Amazon&#39;s device ships with a USB cord.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overall, reviewers seem to think the two light-up readers are almost evenly matched with Amazon&#39;s e-reader coming out slightly ahead due to screen quality and breadth of content. But if you like physical buttons or simply have more books in Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s system than Amazon&#39;s, the newly cheaper Nook may be just the thing for you.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Related stories:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Barnes and Noble steps up battle against Amazon Review Roundup: Early takes on Kindle Fire HD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">As buzz builds around Apple iPhone 5, focus shifts from high-tech wizardry to content </a><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com" target="_blank">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020121001e8a1002ux</p></body></html>
