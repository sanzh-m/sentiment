All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">David Blum does not have a regular table at the Four Seasons or host celebrity parties at the top of the Standard Hotel.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He does not get a lot of fawning press. After he was fired by The Village Voice and left The New York Press, Gawker Media in 2009 pronounced him ‘‘a sad bumbling doctor for dying New York City weeklies.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But four years is an eon in the digital realm, and in that time Mr. Blum has transformed himself from doctor of the dying to midwife of the up-and-coming. As such, he is a man whom authors want to court.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Blum is the editor of Amazon Kindle Singles, a Web service that is helping to promote a renaissance of novella-length journalism and fiction, known as e-shorts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Kindle Singles is a hybrid. First, it is a store within the megastore of Amazon.com, offering a showcase of carefully selected original works of 5,000 to 30,000 words that come from an array of outside publishers as well as from in-house. Most sell for less than $2, and Mr. Blum is the final arbiter of what goes up for sale.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is also a small, in-house publishing brand — analogous to a grocery store that makes an in-house brand of salsa to compete with other manufacturers. Mr. Blum comes up with his own ideas or cherry-picks pieces from the more than 1,000 unsolicited manuscripts he receives each month. He then edits them and helps pick cover art.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Singles usually pays nothing upfront to the author (there are rare exceptions) and keeps 30 percent of all sales. Yet it is an enticing deal for some authors, because Singles now delivers a reliable purchasing audience, giving them a chance to earn thousands for their work. (A quick calculation shows that the authors make an average of roughly $22,000, but the amount varies widely by piece.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Every day I become more obsessed with how brilliant the concept is,’’ Mr. Blum, 57, said over coffee at the Lamb’s Club in Manhattan, crediting the idea entirely to Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For him, the brilliance is that authors can now share in the profits instead of getting a flat fee. ‘‘The idea that writers would participate in the publishing model is just very bold,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon says the Singles store is profitable, having sold nearly five million copies since it opened in January 2011. But the program is as much about gaining entree into the literary world as it is about revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has become the bête noire of the industry, using its market share to keep the prices of books lower than publishers and authors would like. Its New York publishing branch, founded in 2012, has struggled partly because of that enmity, as brick-and-mortar bookstores have refused to carry its works. Amazon has also had to pay large sums to attract even second-tier authors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But because Singles is filling a literary terrain not crowded by other retailers, it has established itself with far less resistance than Amazon’s other publishing branches did. With magazines folding or shrinking because of financial pressures, long-form storytelling has few places to flourish, and the company has leapt firmly into that void, along with other digital publishers like Atavist and Byliner and even some traditional houses like Penguin.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, little that Amazon does fails to arouse suspicion. Authors are intrigued and covet the stream of money, but some are still afraid that they will alienate their book publishers by using Singles for novella-length work.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Publishers are watching closely to see whether Amazon is building a next generation of talented authors who will have no connection to them — and in the process acquiring legitimacy in literary circles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Already, reliable best-selling authors like Stephen King have turned to the site for their own purposes. In January Mr. King published an 8,000-word essay on gun control as an Amazon Single. He opted for Singles because of its speed, he said. A week after he offered the script, it had been copy-edited, had cover art and was for sale online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Publishers point out that the best-selling Kindle Singles, like ‘‘Second Son,’’ by the British thriller writer Lee Child, come through them and are also distributed across other Web sites that sell fiction of similar length, like Apple and Barnes &amp; Noble.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, more than 250,000 copies of ‘‘Second Son’’ were sold through Singles, by far the largest share of the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For now, it falls to Mr. Blum to allay the suspicions, and he is using his deep connections in the New York media world to try to do so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It helps that he has worked for a range of publications, including The Wall Street Journal (where he met his wife, the television writer Terri Minsky, who created Disney’s ‘‘Lizzie McGuire’’), Esquire, New York magazine and The New York Times Magazine.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He has taken part in a long-running poker game with the likes of Richard Ben Cramer, the author and journalist who died in January, and David Hirshey, now executive editor of HarperCollins.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Hirshey recalled that Mr. Blum played so badly that they nicknamed him ‘‘Deaf, Blum and Blind.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And his connections have helped in other ways. Breaking into journalism in the 1980s, Mr. Blum shared office space with Susan Orlean, now a New Yorker writer and the author of ‘‘The Orchid Thief,’’ and Donald Katz, founder of Audible, which makes audiobooks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Katz, whose company was bought by Amazon in 2008, lobbied for Mr. Blum to get the job heading Singles. Ms. Orlean readily agreed to write an early single, ‘‘Animalish’’ (2011), lending the brand prestige and credibility.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Besides luring luminaries like Ms. Orlean,Mr. Blum has tried to maintain the brand’s prestige by tightly limiting the number of offerings. Although the digital bookshelf is infinite, Kindle has posted only 345 Singles since its inception in January 2011, according to the company’s figures. (As of March 20, the company says, about 28 percent of the works have sold more than 10,000 copies, and nearly 8 percent have sold over 50,000 copies.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evan Ratliff, chief executive and co-founder of Atavist, said one thing his company likes about Singles is that it doesn’t accept every submission. ‘‘They actually make a concerted effort to find something great,’’ he added. ‘‘While we might disagree on the specifics of what that is, our overall sensibilities are aligned.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But while remaining choosy, Mr. Blum takes a special pride in nurturing undiscovered authors. A favorite is Mishka Shubaly, a musician and recovered alcoholic who under Mr. Blum’s tutelage has written three best-selling memoirs on Kindle Singles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Shubaly said that he admired Mr. Blum but that he could be a challenge to work for.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘He is a very frustrating editor because he will identify the problem, but won’t give you a solution,’’ he said. ‘‘He is like a therapist, and I mean that as the lowest possible insult.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, said Mr. Shubaly, who has been living off the income from his Singles, in the end ‘‘it is something dramatically better than you could have done, and something that you feel is really your own.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130424e94o00008</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_004.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2">finance</a><a name="bookmark3">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon lets eBay take over tax fight; DealBook</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BY ANDREW ROSS SORKIN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,060 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24 April 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International Herald Tribune INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">22</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. Let’s rename it the eBay loophole.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For more than a decade, Amazon led a ferocious lobbying campaign in Washington against legislation requiring online merchants to collect state and local sales tax from their customers. Local and national retailers with</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">brick-and-mortar stores complained that online merchants were enjoying a tax-free ride — they don’t have to collect state sales tax unless they have operations in the state — and getting an unfair advantage. The tax treatment was widely known as the Amazon loophole, until Amazon.com dropped its opposition to the tax. (More on why Amazon did that in a moment.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Amazon’s place has emerged its smaller rival, eBay, which has taken up the cause with a major campaign against the tax just as the issue is moving through Washington for the first time in earnest. On Monday, the bill cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate, setting it up for a vote this week, and President Barack Obama said he supported it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the weekend, John Donahoe, eBay’s chief executive, sent out an audacious e-mail to tens of millions of eBay merchants, pleading with them to write their representatives in Congress and urge them to block the legislation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This legislation treats you and big multibillion-dollar online retailers — such as Amazon — exactly the same,’’ Mr. Donahoe wrote. ‘‘It may harm your ability to grow and costs jobs, including yours.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Talk about being heavy-handed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most of eBay’s sellers have less than $1 million in out-of-state revenue and, under the terms of the proposal, the Marketplace Fairness Act, would be exempt from collecting the tax anyway.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It isn’t until the end of his letter that Mr. Donahoe argues for a compromise. If there is action, he wrote, the bill should be changed so that a small business is defined as making less than $10 million in out-of-state sales or having fewer than 50 employees. ‘‘To put that in perspective, Amazon does more than $10 million of sales every 90 minutes.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Donahoe, who deserves credit for turning around eBay in recent years, isn’t trying to protect the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mom-and-pop store or the struggling artist. He’s trying to keep substantial businesses with real revenue from paying taxes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When I asked an eBay spokeswoman to quantify how many eBay sellers would be affected by the legislation if it were not raised to the $10 million cap, she said she did not have a number. (Considering the amount of money and energy eBay is spending on its lobbying effort, you would think it would be able to quantify the cost.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Part of eBay’s argument is that it is too complicated and expensive for small merchants to collect the tax. ‘‘Are you prepared to collect sales taxes in the more than 9,600 tax jurisdictions across the U.S.?’’ Mr. Donahoe asked.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What Mr. Donahoe did not mention is that Amazon will already collect those taxes for merchants if they ask, and eBay will help provide them with third-party technology services that will help them do so, too. There are a number of companies that will manage and streamline the process, like Avalara or TaxCloud. And you have to believe that if the bill gets passed, there will be a cottage industry of companies that will offer services to collect the taxes, including eBay, which has made a reputation trying to streamline the selling process for merchants. In</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">fairness, eBay also argues that the cost of complying with enforcement will be a nightmare. Think about the prospect of an out-of-state tax audit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before we continue, a little history: The reason the online merchants don’t have to collect sales tax is a function of the Supreme Court ruling in 1992 in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota. In that case, Quill, a mail-order office equipment retailer, was sued over what North Dakota said was taxes due because Quill shipped products to the state. The court ruled that merchants did not have to collect taxes in a state unless they had a physical presence in the state. That covered mail-order businesses and, yes, the then-nascent business of Internet retailing. (Amazon didn’t even exist then.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A note to readers, and to self: If you live in a state with a sales tax, you are supposed to submit uncollected taxes on Internet purchases at the end of the year, even if the merchant doesn’t seek it at the time of the sale. Of course, nobody does that.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At a time when states are desperate for revenue, you can see the allure of taxing online merchants. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, $23 billion is lost annually from out-of-state sales, a considerable portion from online transactions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There’s an argument to made, which eBay does, that the sales tax is regressive for businesses — and it is. The tax does not discriminate between a large national retailer and a mom-and-pop. The tax is flat. And big business already has special tax advantages: States often offer big companies tax incentives to build stores and distribution systems, benefits that are not offered to small businesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But on the flip side, there is an argument that the current state of sales taxes online is regressive for consumers. Poorer people are less likely to be able to benefit from being able to shop online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So what about Amazon? Why did it abandon the fight?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not because it felt altruistic. It was a business decision. As Amazon has grown, it has become better positioned to handle the tax hit. And perhaps more important, it is moving to build physical warehouse and shipping centers in many states so that it can offer faster delivery services, in some cases within 24 hours. That means it would most likely have had to collect sales tax anyway.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the end, it is unclear whether the Republican-controlled House of Representatives will approve tax legislation if it clears the Senate, as expected. But when consumers make purchases, either in a store or online, they should be prepared to pay the requisite sales tax.

First, it is a store within the megastore of Amazon.com, offering a showcase of carefully selected original works of 5,000 to 30,000 words that come from an array of outside publishers as well as from in-house. Most sell for less than $2, and Mr. Blum is the final arbiter of what goes up for sale.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is also a small, in-house publishing brand — analogous to a grocery store that makes an in-house brand of salsa to compete with other manufacturers. Mr. Blum comes up with his own ideas or cherry-picks pieces from the more than 1,000 unsolicited manuscripts he receives each month. He then edits them and helps pick cover art.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Singles usually pays nothing upfront to the author (there are rare exceptions) and keeps 30 percent of all sales. Yet it is an enticing deal for some authors, because Singles now delivers a reliable purchasing audience, giving them a chance to earn thousands for their work. (A quick calculation shows that the authors make an average of roughly $22,000, but the amount varies widely by piece.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Every day I become more obsessed with how brilliant the concept is,” Mr. Blum, 57, said over coffee at the Lamb’s Club in Manhattan, crediting the idea entirely to Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For him, the brilliance is that authors can now share in the profits instead of getting a flat fee. “The idea that writers would participate in the publishing model is just very bold,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon says the Singles store is profitable, having sold nearly five million copies since it opened in January 2011. But the program is as much about gaining entree into the literary world as it is about revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has become the bête noire of the industry, using its market share to keep the prices of books lower than publishers and authors would like. Its New York publishing branch, founded in 2012, has struggled partly because of that enmity, as brick-and-mortar bookstores have refused to carry its works. Amazon has also had to pay large sums to attract even second-tier authors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But because Singles is filling a literary terrain not crowded by other retailers, it has established itself with far less resistance than Amazon’s other publishing branches did. With magazines folding or shrinking because of financial pressures, long-form storytelling has few places to flourish, and the company has leapt firmly into that void, along with other digital publishers like Atavist and Byliner and even some traditional houses like Penguin.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, little that Amazon does fails to arouse suspicion. Authors are intrigued and covet the stream of money, but some are still afraid that they will alienate their book publishers by using Singles for novella-length work.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Publishers are watching closely to see whether Amazon is building a next generation of talented authors who will have no connection to them — and in the process acquiring legitimacy in literary circles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Already, reliable best-selling authors like Stephen King have turned to the site for their own purposes. In January Mr. King published an 8,000-word essay on gun control as an Amazon Single. He opted for Singles because of its speed, he said. A week after he offered the script, it had been copy-edited, had cover art and was for sale online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Publishers point out that the best-selling Kindle Singles, like “Second Son,” by the British thriller writer Lee Child, come through them and are also distributed across other Web sites that sell fiction of similar length, like Apple and Barnes &amp; Noble.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, more than 250,000 copies of “Second Son” were sold through Singles, by far the largest share of the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For now, it falls to Mr. Blum to allay the suspicions, and he is using his deep connections in the New York media world to try to do so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It helps that he has worked for a range of publications, including The Wall Street Journal (where he met his wife, the television writer Terri Minsky, who created Disney’s “Lizzie McGuire”), Esquire, New York magazine and The New York Times Magazine.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He has taken part in a long-running poker game with the likes of Richard Ben Cramer, the author and journalist who died in January, and David Hirshey, now executive editor of HarperCollins.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Hirshey recalled that Mr. Blum played so badly that they nicknamed him “Deaf, Blum and Blind.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And his connections have helped in other ways. Breaking into journalism in the 1980s, Mr. Blum shared office space with Susan Orlean, now a New Yorker writer and the author of “The Orchid Thief,” and Donald Katz, founder of Audible, which makes audiobooks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Katz, whose company was bought by Amazon in 2008, lobbied for Mr. Blum to get the job heading Singles. Ms. Orlean readily agreed to write an early single, “Animalish” (2011), lending the brand prestige and credibility.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Besides luring luminaries like Ms. Orlean, Mr. Blum has tried to maintain the brand’s prestige by tightly limiting the number of offerings. Although the digital bookshelf is infinite, Kindle has posted only 345 Singles since its inception in January 2011, according to the company’s figures. (As of March 20, the company says, about 28 percent of the works have sold more than 10,000 copies, and nearly 8 percent have sold over 50,000 copies.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evan Ratliff, chief executive and co-founder of Atavist, said one thing his company likes about Singles is that it doesn’t accept every submission. “They actually make a concerted effort to find something great,” he added. “While we might disagree on the specifics of what that is, our overall sensibilities are aligned.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But while remaining choosy, Mr. Blum takes a special pride in nurturing undiscovered authors. A favorite is Mishka Shubaly, a musician and recovered alcoholic who under Mr. Blum’s tutelage has written three best-selling memoirs on Kindle Singles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Shubaly said he admired Mr. Blum but that he could be a challenge to work for.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“He is a very frustrating editor because he will identify the problem, but won’t give you a solution,” he said. “He is like a therapist, and I mean that as the lowest possible insult.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, said Mr. Shubaly, who has been living off the income from his Singles, in the end “it is something dramatically better than you could have done, and something that you feel is really your own.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020130422e94n003bm</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_009.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark12">DealBook</a><a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business Day; Dealbook</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">EBay Joins Sales Tax Fight</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By WILLIAM ALDEN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,690 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23 April 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As president of Microsoft’s server and tools division, a $19 billion-a-year business devoted to databases, servers and other software products, Satya Nadella has a predictable cast of competitors to worry about. There is Oracle, VMware, SAP and a bunch of other makers of highly technical products that make everyday services like banking and airline reservations work, even if the software running them is invisible to most consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But one of Mr. Nadella’s competitors — Amazon.com, the Internet retailer — is not like the others.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is beloved by consumers for its seemingly infinite online selection of merchandise available for one-click purchasing, speedy delivery and Kindle e-readers. Out of view of most of the public, though, it has transformed itself into a huge player in the field of cloud computing. By renting capacity on the industrial-strength servers and beefy Internet connections in its data centers to anyone willing to pay for it, Amazon has become the virtual landlord of choice for technology start-ups, including the likes of Instagram and Foursquare.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microsoft wants a piece of the action. On Tuesday, the company is opening to general availability a new service that competes directly with Amazon’s cloud offering. (Microsoft has been testing the service with customers for the past year.) And to make sure it is taken seriously, Microsoft is committing to match Amazon’s prices for its cloud service, which is known as the Elastic Compute Cloud.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It’s a two-horse race between us and Amazon,’’ Mr. Nadella said in a phone interview last week, noting the Seattle location of its cloud rival, a short distance away from Microsoft’s Redmond, Washington, headquarters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Actually, that may be wishful thinking on Mr. Nadella’s part. Google and Rackspace are among the other companies that are fighting with Microsoft for the No. 2 spot in the cloud market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cloud is a profound threat to Microsoft’s traditional business of selling software that people install on their machines. As a result, the company’s executives for some time now have been blaring their own plans to become serious cloud competitors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For its first foray into the business a few years ago with a service called Windows Azure, Microsoft settled on an approach that played to its strengths, offering customers the ability to rent applications like databases and servers for broadcasting video. Amazon, in contrast, was known for more minimalist, low-level services — storage space on its servers, computing time and a share of its Internet connections.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Microsoft’s offering was akin to a garage space outfitted with an arsenal of power tools, Amazon was renting just the garage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microsoft’s approach had appeal — the company says it has 200,000 Windows Azure customers — but not as much as what Amazon is offering. While the big companies targeted by Microsoft for its initial Windows Azure services are likely to embrace the cloud aggressively at some point, the most ardent cloud supporters right now are technically sophisticated start-ups. And what they want is what Amazon — and starting this week, perhaps Microsoft — has to offer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘They mistimed the market for sure,’’ James Staten, an analyst at Forrester Research, said of Microsoft.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Forrester’s surveys of cloud developers, about 70 percent say they are using Amazon’s infrastructure, while about 30 percent say they are using Microsoft. (Many customers spread their business across several cloud vendors.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Nadella, a Microsoft veteran, said the company was well positioned to become a stronger player in cloud computing because it had a more diverse portfolio of offerings than Amazon. ‘‘It’s still the early part of the cloud market,’’ he said. ‘‘Clearly they have done a good job in one segment of it. But it will play out.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130422e94n0006i</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_011.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark16">BITS</a><a name="bookmark17">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Gains On iTunes In Music Sales</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By NICK BILTON</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">354 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">22 April 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 8</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is helping Apple celebrate the 10th anniversary of iTunes by gaining momentum on music downloads in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to a new study released by NPD Group, the market research firm, in 2012 Amazon accounted for 22 percent of paid music downloaded in the United States. This is up from 15 percent in 2011.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The report, &#39;&#39;Annual Music Study 2012,&#39;&#39; found that Apple still dominates the music download world, with 63 percent of all paid downloads taking place through iTunes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon&#39;s rise seems to be attributed to updates of the company&#39;s color Kindle Fire tablets last year. These tablets are capable of playing music directly purchased from AmazonMP3, the online retailer&#39;s digital music service. The Kindle Fire provides access to more than 18 million movies, TV shows, magazines and books, according to Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although Amazon does not share numbers about sales of its Kindle Fire devices, calculations by Forrester Research estimate that Amazon sold close to five million Kindle Fire tablets by the end of last year. In comparison, Apple has sold more than 100 million iPads.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although there has been huge growth in customers using streaming music services, including Pandora, Rdio and Spotify, NPD Group reported that the number of music downloads in the United States has remained relatively unaffected by these new music outlets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;NPD estimates that average per-buyer spending on music downloads increased 6 percent, year over year, due largely to increases in music purchasing by teens, along with an increase in the number of consumers purchasing both single song tracks and full albums,&#39;&#39; the company said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">The report said 44 million Americans purchased at least one song or album last year.

You, and your children, can decide and in the process tell Amazon which of the pilots should become series. You can also catch a glimpse of what goes into the development of the shows, some of which (like “Creative Galaxy”) aren’t yet fully produced or animated. “We’re letting people in before we’re done,” Ms. Santomero said. “I’m excited and I’m nervous, and it’s kind of scary, as a creator, to put it out there when it’s not done and all your ideas are not fully there, but it’s kind of amazing, too.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The pilots can only be streamed or downloaded — they’re not available on network or cable TV. Amazon Studios is clearly aimed at families who take their video “to go” on smaller devices (although some families also stream to televisions). It’s a change that shifts the selection of new programs to parents (preschoolers won’t see any promotions for these shows while watching an old favorite, at least not yet).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s also a change that suggests that preschoolers might be viewing their programs on smaller screens — screens that might not be visible to their parents. Most of the television viewing in our family takes place on the television in our living room, enabling me to help my oldest spot “clues” with Blue 10 years ago and offering me the opportunity, now, to comment on their chosen weekend viewing (“I have never, in all of my life, met anyone as stupid as those characters”).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/business/media/young-people-are-watching-but-less-often-on-tv.html?pagewanted=all" class="s1" target="_blank">So I might stream, or later download, an Amazon program.

In the accompanying letter to shareholders, the company’s founder and chief executive spends a great deal of space defending Amazon’s efforts to keep lowering prices and adding features to its products. This will, he says, win customer loyalty and repay the company over the long haul.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not surprising stuff, for a company that has risen to dominance by all but ignoring profitability for the sake of scale. What is surprising is the amount of ink (or more properly, pixels, given that this was primarily an</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-document) that Mr. Bezos gave Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing rental service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">AWS is the world’s largest public cloud, as the rental of computing, data storage and associated applications is called. Within Amazon itself, however, it is small, accounting for most of the $2.5 billion in “other” revenue Amazon made in 2012. Total revenue for the year was $61 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By next year AWS, which is growing fast, may well account for more than 5 percent of company revenue, at which time it should break into its own category. In the letter, Mr. Bezos singles out the service as “a very clear example” of giving the customer more than expected:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“In 2012, AWS announced 159 new features and services,” he writes. “We’ve reduced AWS prices 27 times since launching 7 years ago, added enterprise service support enhancements, and created innovative tools to help customers be more efficient. AWS Trusted Advisor monitors customer configurations, compares them to known best practices, and then notifies customers where opportunities exist to improve performance, enhance security, or save money. Yes, we are actively telling customers they’re paying us more than they need to. In the last 90 days, customers have saved millions of dollars through Trusted Advisor, and the service is only getting started. All of this progress comes in the context of AWS being the widely recognized leader in its area — a situation where you might worry that external motivation could fail. On the other hand, internal motivation — the drive to get the customer to say “Wow” — keeps the pace of innovation fast.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is an unusual shout-out at a time when most Amazon investors don’t know, or care, much about AWS. Remember, though, that Mr. Bezos is all about the long game. Over time, top executives at AWS say, they fully expect AWS to be as big a contributor to the business as Amazon’s third-party sales.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2013/04/google-compute-engine-now-available-to.html" class="s1" target="_blank">It is not too early to get ready for that day, particularly with both </a><a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2013/04/google-compute-engine-now-available-to.html" class="a" target="_blank">Google</a> <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/microsoft-moves-farther-into-the-cloud/" class="s1" target="_blank">and </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/microsoft-moves-farther-into-the-cloud/" class="a" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> <span style=" color: #000;">increasing their own efforts in the cloud.</span></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/amazons-a-w-s-job-openings-reveal-its-future/" class="a" target="_blank">Job Openings at Amazon Web Services Reveal Its </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/amazons-a-w-s-job-openings-reveal-its-future/" target="_blank">Future</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/amazon-reshapes-business-with-cloud-service/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Reshapes Business Computing With Cloud </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/amazon-reshapes-business-with-cloud-service/" target="_blank">Service</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/how-to-run-your-not-small-company-off-a-laptop/" class="a" target="_blank">How to Run Your (Not Small) Company Off of a </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/how-to-run-your-not-small-company-off-a-laptop/" target="_blank">Laptop</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/supercomputing-rented-by-the-hour/" class="a" target="_blank">Supercomputing Rented by the </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/supercomputing-rented-by-the-hour/" target="_blank">Hour</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon Creates a Software Rental Store<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020130413e94c0002t</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_015.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark24">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark25">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">One on One: Jason Merkoski and the View of E-Books From the Inside</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,314 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8 April 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

It’s a mixture of an insider’s tale, quirky analysis and informed speculation about our onrushing digital destiny, told with an appealing ambivalence that should give it a wide readership. What follows is an edited Q&amp;A with the</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">41-year-old author.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You write that “Amazon, Apple and Google are a bit like medieval fortresses in their own ways. They’re secretive like China or Japan before they opened up to Westerners, or like Tibet or Mecca, closed to foreigners.” Are they afraid that if people knew what was going on, the peasants might storm the gates?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are two issues about secrecy here: social responsibility and intellectual property. As far as social responsibility goes, let me just say this: These companies have entire buildings filled with lawyers. They aren’t there to come up with new lawyer jokes. They are there, in part, to keep people like me from even answering this question. That said, I think if people were given a chance to spend a day looking inside Amazon or Apple’s veil of secrecy, most of them would be fascinated — although some might boycott.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">And with intellectual property? A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The biggest tech companies are secretive to the point of clinical paranoia because there’s an all-out arms race in innovation. If one company knew what another was doing, it could one-up the other with newer, better, cheaper features. That said, tech companies cross-pollinate all the time, with their ideas and worker-bees who flit from hive to hive, from Apple to Amazon to Google.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You also say, in discussing the tech companies’ power: “What moral or literary sensibilities do the executives at Amazon have? What about the retailers at Barnes &amp; Noble or Google or Apple? You have to ask yourself whether you trust these men.” Well, do you?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are three dimensions of trust here. Do I trust retailers not to censor books, do I trust them with my personal data, and do I trust them to curate great books for me to read? Frankly, I don’t trust the executives at any e-book retailer when it comes to censorship. I know many of them. If push came to shove, I think most of these execs would rather pull e-books from the store, effectively censoring them, if that would avoid bad press. These are major retailers, not your quirky corner bookstores. They’re manned by former management consultants in clean shirts and pressed Dockers, not eccentric book-lovers with beards and cats.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And your personal data?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I do trust them with my identity. These companies are obsessed with safeguarding privacy. The worst they’re going to do is show me more ads.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And to recommend things?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Not yet. When it comes to book recommendations, retailers have the literary sensibilities of a spreadsheet — they’ll just recommend the most popular books to me, or books that other people also bought, but they know nothing of the soul and sparkle of a great book. I hope this changes over time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For an e-book developer you certainly seem attached to your physical books. Even after trying to cull them, you still have thousands of them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I’m a sentimentalist. I’ve got many more books than friends, and I think I always will. Some are such a part of my life that I can’t get rid of them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In some ways, “Burning the Page” is a celebration of the physical book even as it is looking ahead to its extinction.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reading is great, but I don’t know whether you need paper and ink for it. You’re going to get so much more from e-books because they bring your friends and family into the margins of your reading experience. They will be literally on the same page with you.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That gives me the creeps.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We can lament the older experience of reading, because that’s what we were raised with. But there’s nothing to be afraid of. Technology has a way of shifting, and we’re adaptable. That’s our genius: we do adapt.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Physical books were convenient, cheap, easy to use, attractive, practically indestructible. What will the great advantages of e-books be?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 20 years, the space of one generation, print books will be as rare as vinyl LPs. You’ll still be able to find them in artsy hipster stores, but that’s about it. So the great advantage of e-books is also their curse; e-books will be the only game in town if you want to read a book. It’s sobering, and a bit sad. That said, e-books can do what print books can’t. They’ll allow you to fit an entire library into the space of one book. They’ll allow you to search for anything in an instant, save your thoughts forever, share them with the world, and connect with other readers right there, inside the book. The book of the future will live and breathe.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">You also write about what will be lost. A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I found a book at my grandmother’s house that was inscribed by my great-grandfather. I learned what his original last name was — before he changed it. That was an interesting link to my past. We’re going to lose that sort of trace of ourselves if we go all digital.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Another surprising thing you said was, “E-books aren’t ready for children yet.” A.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Giving children an e-book at this point might not be that much better than plunking them down in front of a TV, especially if they’re reading the e-book on a multifunction device with instant messages, games and other distractions. Better they should be outside and engaged with the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why did you leave Amazon?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Working at Amazon was like getting an M.B.A. and a Ph.D. at the same time. It was an incredible education. These were the smartest people I ever worked with. But Amazon had a dark side as well, as if it were the mean stepmother in a fairy tale. There was this push to get great products out to consumers. It makes a lot of teams very haggard. Amazon is held together by adrenaline, spreadsheets and people running around like crazy.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/e-book-sellers-face-a-battle-to-win-ipad-customers/" class="a" target="_blank">E-Book Sellers Face a Battle to Win iPad </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/e-book-sellers-face-a-battle-to-win-ipad-customers/" target="_blank">Customers</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/with-a-kindle-hiring-spree-amazon-gears-up-for-battle-with-apple/" class="a" target="_blank">With a Kindle Hiring Spree, Amazon Gears Up for Battle With </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/with-a-kindle-hiring-spree-amazon-gears-up-for-battle-with-apple/" target="_blank">Apple</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/daily-report-wal-mart-deletes-the-kindle/" class="a" target="_blank">Daily Report: Wal-Mart Deletes the </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/daily-report-wal-mart-deletes-the-kindle/" target="_blank">Kindle</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/bestsellers-from-a-vanished-world/" class="a" target="_blank">Best Sellers From a Vanished </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/bestsellers-from-a-vanished-world/" target="_blank">World</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Pulp Friction: The Kindle Debate<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020130408e948001rz</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_016.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark26">finance</a><a name="bookmark27">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Web searches that try to read your mind; No longer just pointing people in right direction, but answering queries</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,209 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5 April 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International Herald Tribune INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">15</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Say you need a latté. You might pull out your phone, open the Yelp app and search for a nearby cafe. If instead you want to buy an espresso machine, you will most likely tap Amazon.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Either way, Google lost a customer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google remains the undisputed king of search, with about two-thirds of the U.S. market. But the nature of search is changing, especially as more people search for what they want to buy, eat or learn on their mobile devices.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This has put the $22 billion search industry, perhaps the most lucrative and influential of online businesses, at its most significant crossroad since its invention.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No longer do people want to search the Web like the index of a book — finding links where a particular keyword appears. They expect new kinds of customized search, which develop the knowledge and comprehension to answer specific queries, not just point people in the right direction. As a result, topical sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor or Amazon are chipping away at Google’s hold.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘What people want is, ‘You ask a very simple question and you get a very simple answer,’’’ said Oren Etzioni, a professor at the University of Washington who has co-founded companies for shopping and flight search. ‘‘We don’t want the 10 blue links on that small screen. We want to know the closest sushi place, make a reservation and be on our way.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">People are overwhelmed at how crowded the Internet has become — Google says there are 30 trillion Web addresses, up from one trillion five years ago — and people expect their computers and phones to be smarter and do more for them. Many of the new efforts are services that people do not even think of as search engines.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, for example, has a larger share than Google of U.S. shopping searches, the most lucrative kind because people are in the mood to buy something. On sites like Pinterest and Polyvore, people have curated their favorite things from around the Web to produce results when you search for, say, ‘‘lace dress.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On smartphones, people skip Google and go directly to apps, like Kayak or Weather Underground. Other apps send people information, like traffic or flight delays, before they even ask for it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">People use YouTube to search for things like how to tie a bow tie, Siri to search on their iPhones, online maps to find local places and Facebook to find things their friends have liked.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And services like LinkedIn Influencers and Quora are trying to be different kinds of search engines — places to find high-quality, expert content and avoid weeding through everything else on the Web. On Quora, questions like ‘‘What was it like to work for Steve Jobs?’’ get answered by people with firsthand knowledge, something Google cannot provide.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google remains the one to beat, even as alternative search sites become popular.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘They’re the specialty store you’re going into here and there,’’ said Danny Sullivan, an editor of Search Engine Land, a blog, ‘‘but they’re not your grocery store.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet the promise of search is big enough that even though Microsoft loses billions of dollars a year on Bing and has failed to make a major dent in Google’s U.S. market share, it keeps at it. Microsoft — which in February had</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">17 percent of that market, rising to 26 percent when the searches it powered for Yahoo are included — has said it views search as essential to its other products, whether the Xbox or phones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘You have millions of people a day saying exactly what they want, and if you’re an advertiser, it’s a beautiful vehicle,’’ Mr. Sullivan said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EMarketer estimates that Google earns about three-quarters of search ad spending in the United States. Search engines bring companies troves of data and a measure of control as Internet users’ entry point to the digital world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are signs that people’s search behaviors are changing, however, with consequences for these companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Searches on traditional services, dominated by Google, declined 3 percent in the second half of last year after having risen for years, according to comScore, and the number of searches per searcher declined 7 percent. In contrast, searches on topical sites, known as vertical search engines, climbed 8 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While traditional searches increased again this year, other data reflect the threat to Google.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the first quarter, spending on search ads fell 1 percent, a significant slowdown for Google, according to IgnitionOne, a digital marketing company. Last year, Google lost U.S. market share in search ads for the first time, according to eMarketer, falling to 72.8 percent from 74 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This year, ad spending on traditional search engines is expected to grow more slowly than overall online ad spending, a reversal.

But the nature of search is changing, especially as more people search for what they want to buy, eat or learn on their mobile devices. This has put the $22 billion search industry, perhaps the most lucrative and influential of online businesses, at its most significant crossroad since its invention.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No longer do consumers want to search the Web like the index of a book — finding links at which a particular keyword appears. They expect new kinds of customized search, like that on topical sites such as Yelp, TripAdvisor or Amazon, which are chipping away at Google’s hold. Google and its competitors are trying to develop the knowledge and comprehension to answer specific queries, not just point users in the right direction.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What people want is, ‘You ask a very simple question and you get a very simple answer,’ ” said Oren Etzioni, a professor at the University of Washington who has co-founded companies for shopping and flight search. “We don’t want the 10 blue links on that small screen. We want to know the closest sushi place, make a reservation and be on our way.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">People are overwhelmed at how crowded the Internet has become — Google says there are 30 trillion Web addresses, up from 1 trillion five years ago — and users expect their computers and phones to be smarter and do more for them. Many of the new efforts are services that people do not even think of as search engines.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/technology/google-shopping-competition-amazon-charging-retailers.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon, for example, has </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/technology/google-shopping-competition-amazon-charging-retailers.html" class="a" target="_blank">a larger share than Google</a> <span style=" color: #000;">of shopping searches, the most lucrative kind because people are in the mood to buy something. On sites like Pinterest and Polyvore, users have curated their favorite things from around the Web to produce results when you search for, say, “lace dress.”</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/business/mobile-apps-drive-rapid-changes-in-search-technology.html" class="s1" target="_blank">On smartphones, people skip Google and </a>go directly to apps<span class="p">, like Kayak or Weather Underground. Other apps send people information, like traffic or flight delays, before they even ask for it.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">People use YouTube to search for things like how to tie a bow tie, Siri to search on their iPhones, online maps to find local places and Facebook to find things their friends have liked.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And services like LinkedIn Influencers and Quora are trying to be different kinds of search engines — places to find high-quality, expert content and avoid weeding through everything else on the Web. On Quora, questions like “What was it like to work for Steve Jobs?” get answered by people with firsthand knowledge, something Google cannot provide.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“There is a lot of pressure on search engines to deliver more customized, more relevant results,” said Shar VanBoskirk, an analyst at Forrester. “Users don’t need links to Web pages. We need answers, solutions, whatever intel we were searching for.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Google remains the one to beat, even as alternative search sites become popular. “They’re the specialty store you’re going into here and there,” said Danny Sullivan, an editor of Search Engine Land, a blog, “but they’re not your grocery store.”</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2013/3/comScore_Releases_February_2013_U.S._Search_Engine_Rankings" class="s1" target="_blank">Yet the promise of search is big enough that even though Microsoft loses billions of dollars a year on Bing and has failed to make a dent in </a>Google’s market share<span class="p">, it keeps at it. Microsoft — which in February had 17 percent of the market, and 26 percent including the searches it powered for Yahoo — has said it views search as essential to its other products, from the Xbox to phones. And there is still a lot of money to be made as No. 2.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“You have millions of people a day saying exactly what they want, and if you’re an advertiser, it’s a beautiful vehicle,” Mr. Sullivan said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EMarketer estimates that Google earns about three-quarters of search ad spending. Search engines bring companies troves of data and a measure of control as Internet users’ entry point to the digital world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are signs that people’s search behaviors are changing, however, with consequences for these companies.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Searches on traditional services<span class="p">, dominated by Google, declined 3 percent in the second half of last year after rising for years, according to comScore, and the number of searches per searcher declined 7 percent. In contrast, searches on topical sites, known as vertical search engines, climbed 8 percent.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While traditional searches increased again this year, other data reflects the threat to Google.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Advertising-Spending-on-Yahoo-Back-Black/1009768" class="s1" target="_blank">In the first quarter, spending on search ads fell 1 percent, a significant slowdown for Google, according to IgnitionOne, a digital marketing company. Last year, </a><a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Advertising-Spending-on-Yahoo-Back-Black/1009768" class="a" target="_blank">Google lost market share in search ads</a> <span style=" color: #000;">for the first time, according to eMarketer, falling to 72.8 percent from 74 percent.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This year, ad spending on traditional search engines is expected to grow more slowly than overall online ad spending, a reversal. Its growth significantly outpaced that of online ad spending until last year, eMarketer said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google is not watching from the sidelines.

Levie, 28, chief executive of the privately held company, said he planned to hire about 100 people in sales, marketing and product development in Paris and Munich by the end of the year, creating a base to capture other fast-growing markets for cloud-based data storage, including Japan, Singapore, Australia and Brazil.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In cloud computing, computer servers are linked to handle many tasks, like simplifying the filing and sharing of data online for companies and governments that rent them for far less than it would cost to build their own infrastructure. Box, on the smaller side of the industry, owns 10 data centers around the world and plans to add more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Box, based in Los Altos, Calif., is in a crowded field: Amazon Web Services is the leader, while Microsoft, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Google are major players.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company raised $150 million from investors last year to finance efforts to expand internationally to compete with prominent rivals like DropBox, based in San Francisco, which opened its first overseas office last year in Dublin.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Right now we’re in aggressive expansion mode because international expansion is really key to our strategy,” Mr. Levie said in an interview in London, where he announced the plans for Europe.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While he would not provide numbers, Mr. Levie said business was increasing significantly in “Europe and beyond.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The planned expansion to Paris and Munich, he said, was part of preparations for an anticipated initial public offering in 2014. Although the company does not disclose profit figures, Mr. Levie said that he valued the company at about $1 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Box, which employs about 700 in its American offices, recruited 40 more people last June for its operation in London. In September, it hired David Quantrell, a former executive at McAfee and Hewlett-Packard, to lead its business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Box says it has 150,000 business clients, and 10 million other users, charging them as little as $15 a month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No more than 15 percent of Box’s revenue comes from overseas, Mr. Levie said, a figure he hopes to double in the next couple of years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Box said recently that it had signed its biggest contract yet, with the French engineering company Schneider Electric, which will use Box exclusively for its 50,000-member work force.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Box clients include EMI Music, Volkswagen, the digital music service Spotify and Heathrow Airport Holdings, which operates Heathrow Airport.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Box says its services allow business clients’ employees to organize their work on multiple devices like tablets and cellphones while integrating other software like Google Docs or Salesforce.com, a Web application that helps handle large amounts of customer data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hervé Coureil, chief information officer at Schneider Electric, said that cloud-based storage could help companies that operate globally by cutting costs, and by providing a centralized way of tracking how they share files internally and externally.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">American businesses have been faster to embrace the cloud, according to the market research company IDC, with Europe lagging because of worries about data security, regulations and legal jurisdictions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IDC also said that the market for cloud-based services in the 27-member European Union was expected to grow to 10.9 billion euros, or about $14 billion, by 2014, from 4.6 billion euros in 2011.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While the size of the market is still small when measured by revenue and number of users, demand is “hot and growing,” said Alys Woodward, an analyst at IDC who covers software and services in Europe.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It’s where an easy-to-use cloud service is going to cannibalize huge, more complex services like Microsoft’s SharePoint,” she added. SharePoint is a Web platform that helps people collaborate and share information over a corporate network.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">About two-thirds of European companies use cloud-based computing for at least some of their needs, primarily to handle e-mail traffic, according to an IDC survey of 1,056 companies last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Box sees an opportunity because those companies are not yet using the cloud to run the bulk of their businesses, including so-called content management services, the segment in which Box is aiming to grow.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While businesses are unlikely ever to switch completely to the cloud and are expected to retain data on proprietary hardware devices, “over time it will be a nice enhancement,” said Alan Pelz-Sharpe, a research director at 451 Research.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020130331e94100462</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_019.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark32">BITS</a><a name="bookmark33">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Order Online, Pick Up in Store</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">683 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 April 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Following Amazon.com, Walmart will soon allow shoppers to order items online and pick them up from lockers in local stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The introduction of lockers is part of Walmart&#39;s effort to become a superstore online and on cellphones. It announced several e-commerce and mobile tools on Tuesday at a news event at the San Bruno, Calif., headquarters of @WalmartLabs, its digital commerce arm.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We&#39;ve dramatically accelerated customer acquisition online,&#39;&#39; Neil Ashe, chief executive of Walmart global e-commerce, said at the event. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve got to be there. We weren&#39;t there before and now we&#39;re realizing the benefit of that.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The point, Mr. Ashe said, is to offer Walmart products anywhere a consumer wants to shop, whether in stores, online or on a phone. What he didn&#39;t say is that Walmart is also fighting Amazon, the biggest online mall, which has been encroaching on its turf.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At one point, responding to a reporter&#39;s question about Amazon, Mr. Ashe asked, with a smile, &#39;&#39;Who?&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though Walmart&#39;s total sales far exceed Amazon&#39;s, its e-commerce sales are a fraction of Amazon&#39;s. Walmart is on track to generate $9 billion in e-commerce revenue this year, Mr. Ashe said. Amazon&#39;s revenue, most of which comes from e-commerce, is expected to exceed $65 billion this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart&#39;s major e-commerce advantage, said Joel Anderson, chief executive of Walmart.com, is its 4,000 stores. They provide a network of distribution points for things like same-day shipping and in-store pick-up. That is particularly helpful for the quarter of Walmart customers without credit cards or bank accounts who previously were excluded from e-commerce, he said, because they can order online and pay with cash in a Walmart store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To start, the lockers will be available this summer in about a dozen stores in one market, which Walmart declined to name. Customers can avoid shipping fees and pick up their items whenever it is convenient, 24 hours a day at some stores, without interacting with a clerk. Lockers also help consumers who are not home during the day to receive packages and cut down on delivery costs and logistics for retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which introduced lockers in 2011, has been expanding the service in chains like RadioShack and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7-Eleven and local stores. Google, which has been experimenting with retail delivery, recently bought a start-up called BufferBox that provides e-commerce lockers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart is also testing a new home page. It has three tabs -- one for traditional online shopping, one for browsing items that are popular at the moment on Pinterest and search engines and one with personalized information from a shopper&#39;s local store. Walmart recently built a new search engine for the site, which has increased sales 20 percent, the company said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To compete online, where price and selection are most important, Walmart uses software to monitor prices at competing retailers in real time and lower its prices accordingly, said Kelly Thompson, senior vice president of merchandising. It is also doubling the inventory sold from third-party retailers in its online marketplace and tracking search data patterns and social media to choose trendy products, she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart is testing a new mobile app for shopping in stores. Shoppers can add items to their lists using voice or by scanning bar codes. When they enter the store, the app directs them to the aisles where their items are located. It keeps a running total of the items in shoppers&#39; carts, offers digital coupons and receipts and lets people check out themselves and order items online if they are not available in the store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Already, 12 percent of e-commerce sales through Walmart&#39;s mobile app comes from shoppers using the app in Walmart stores, the company said. Over all, a third of Walmart&#39;s e-commerce traffic comes from mobile.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

By running the world’s largest public cloud, Amazon has lowered the demand for products at both EMC and VMware. People can rent the computing they need at the time on Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S., rather than buying and maintaining large amounts of equipment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.W.S. has also built up an increasingly large and varied selection of software applications, lowering the need for companies to own lots of computing assets.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/the-sale-of-nicira-cheaper-clouds-and-troubled-cisco/" class="s1" target="_blank">Mr. Maritz’s last great act at VMware was spending $1.26 billion on a </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/the-sale-of-nicira-cheaper-clouds-and-troubled-cisco/" class="a" target="_blank">networking software company</a> <span style=" color: #000;">that needs a lot of private clouds to succeed.

As a result, authors said Amazon was deleting reviews from its site at the end of 2012 as a way of cracking down.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The deal is made more significant because Amazon already owned part or all of Goodreads&#39; competitors, Shelfari and LibraryThing. It bought Shelfari in 2008. It also owns a portion of LibraryThing as a result of buying companies that already owned a stake in the site. Both are much smaller and have grown much more slowly than Goodreads.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Otis Chandler, a founder of Goodreads, said his management team would remain in place to guard the reviewing process that had made the site attractive to its 16 million members. &#39;&#39;Amazon has a real history of building independent brands and running them as independent companies,&#39;&#39; he said in a phone interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reaction online, however, was swift and laced with skepticism. &#39;&#39;Say hello to a world in which Amazon targets you based on your Goodreads reviews,&#39;&#39; Edward Champion, a writer and editor, posted on Twitter. &#39;&#39;No company should have this power.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The deal did get some support from Hugh Howey, whose book &#39;&#39;Wool&#39;&#39; was originally self-published on Amazon and promoted through Goodreads and became a best seller. &#39;&#39;The best place to discuss books is joining up with the best place to buy books -- to-be-read piles everywhere must be groaning in anticipation,&#39;&#39; he said in the companies&#39; news release.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Russ Grandinetti, Amazon&#39;s vice president for Kindle content, said the integration of the companies was beneficial. For example, it will make it &#39;&#39;super easy,&#39;&#39; he said, for authors that self-publish through Kindle &#39;&#39;to promote their books on Goodreads.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The founders of Goodreads, Elizabeth Khuri Chandler and her husband, Otis Chandler, in their office in San Francisco.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LOS ANGELES -- Junie Hoang, the actress who sued Amazon and its Internet Movie Database unit for posting her age, can take her complaint -- or at least some of it -- to a jury.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Judge Marsha J. Pechman, of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, ruled on Monday that Ms. Hoang, whose legal name is Huong Hoang, could proceed to trial with a breach of contract claim and a request for damages related to her career.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Judge Pechman excluded Amazon as a defendant, leaving only its IMDb unit in the suit; barred any claim by Ms. Hoang for emotional distress; and granted summary judgment denying a claim that the database had violated the Consumer Protection Act by publishing Ms. Hoang&#39;s age without her consent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Anyone who values their privacy and has ever given credit card information to an online company like IMDb or Amazon.com should be concerned about the outcome,&#39;&#39; Ms. Hoang said Tuesday in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A call to Amazon&#39;s media relations department drew no immediate response.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2011, Ms. Hoang, who is now 41 years old, filed a complaint that said IMDb.com, a widely used film and television database, had illegally used her credit card information to obtain and post her age. The disclosure, she said, exposed her to age discrimination in an industry that values youth -- a claim that was bolstered by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which publicly criticized IMDb for posting the ages of performers and others.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In her order on Monday, Judge Pechman described a series of communications in which Ms. Hoang had first omitted her age when subscribing to IMDb, then submitted a false date of birth that made her appear to be seven years younger than her actual age. Eventually, Judge Pechman noted, Ms. Hoang asked IMDb to remove the false birth date, going so far as to submit a fake Texas identification document to show that it was wrong.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instead of relying on the fake document, the judge said, an IMDb employee gained access to Ms. Hoang&#39;s credit card information, then used that to ascertain her actual 1971 birth date from a public records database called PrivateEye.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Hoang&#39;s misrepresentations, the judge said, were not sufficient to bar her claim. But whether IMDb had breached its contract with her, or is liable for damages, must be decided at trial, she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">In an order issued last August, Judge Pechman set the trial date on April 8 of this year.

Amazon expects that this business will eventually be as big as its retail operation.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.W.S. is followed by Microsoft’s Windows Azure and offerings from other companies including Rackspace, Verizon, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google says the cloud business is a new source of profit and a way to improve the Internet by providing other companies access to its sophisticated computing services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts say it is also a strategy to lure developers and businesses to use Google products instead of those of archrivals like Amazon and Microsoft.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cloud business has become so vital to these companies, said James Staten, an analyst at Forrester, because it is crucial to other businesses like mobile apps and online video and music.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most of the apps that run on Google Android phones, for instance, are built using Amazon’s cloud, and Google would like to wrest back control. Microsoft, Amazon and Google are all competing to host online video, a booming business that relies on cloud services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Almost every major consultancy supports Amazon; almost every advertising agency runs on Amazon; if I need to hire 10 people tomorrow to help me build my application, it’s super easy to find people who have Amazon experience,” Mr. Staten said.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/technology/26recruit.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Google plans a major recruiting effort to increase its Seattle-area engineering staff by as much as five times. There is already </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/technology/26recruit.html" class="a" target="_blank">fierce competition</a> <span style=" color: #000;">among tech companies for talented engineers, and many of those with skills in cloud computing work at Google’s rivals in Seattle.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“We’re not the first in this rodeo, but we have the history of Google,” said Brian Goldfarb, Google’s leader of cloud platform marketing, who joined the company last year after a decade at Microsoft. “We have the best data centers on the planet. You can’t really give engineers a bigger, badder thing to work on.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google is also adding 180,000 square feet to its office in Kirkland, Wash., which together with its Seattle office already houses more than 1,000 employees, making it Google’s third largest in the country after its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., and its office in New York.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new office space will have all the requisite perks of tech businesses, where typical office cubicles and fluorescent lights are not enough. It will meet green building standards, with a solar roof and wood from recycled shipping containers. The Seattle office, on a canal, has kayaks and paddleboards for employees, and the Kirkland office uses boats for conference rooms, not to mention the office’s espresso bars, massage parlor and climbing wall.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though the cloud business is still in its early days, Google is already late to the game.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the years, Google, Amazon and Microsoft had each built world-class clouds, consisting of several giant data centers in different countries, to run their own businesses — doing things like searching the Web, hosting online video, managing business software and operating an online mall. Amazon was the first to rent its data storage and computing power to outside customers when it started A.W.S. in 2004, and Microsoft and Google followed. Another company with huge data centers and computing power, Apple, does not rent its cloud.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon earned $800 million from its cloud services last year, according to analyst estimates. It initially focused on start-up Web companies, but has gone on to offer features like e-mail and database search that are attractive to more mainstream corporate customers, including the InterContinental Hotels Group, Samsung and Netflix.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“This is replacing the corporate data center,” said Adam Selipsky, who runs A.W.S. “That shows you how much we have to do. It is a ‘couple of decades’ project.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microsoft started Azure to try to hold on to corporate customers that Amazon wants to pry away, and has struggled for years to adapt its business from selling individual software packages to renting software over the cloud.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google’s cloud offerings originally tied to other Google services. But to reach a broader market, Google has followed Amazon’s lead by offering a cloud platform that works with a much broader range of services, Mr. Staten said.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/technology/google-apps-moving-onto-microsofts-business-turf.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Google has the weakest corporate ties. It sells businesses cloud-based word processing, storage, and spreadsheet tools, but its operation is </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/technology/google-apps-moving-onto-microsofts-business-turf.html" class="a" target="_blank">still much smaller</a> <span style=" color: #000;">than Microsoft’s.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It introduced the Google App Engine, for building and hosting Web and mobile apps on Google’s cloud, in 2004. The company says that 250,000 developers use it to run 1 million apps that generate up to 7.5 billion page hits a day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In June, Google announced Compute Engine, for large-scale computing and data center access, at its annual conference for software developers, in the hope that developers and eventually big companies would use it. But nearly a year later, it is still in a test phase and not open to the public.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">People who have used Google’s cloud business say it is inexpensive and capable, but lacks some features of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.W.S. Google has said its cloud services will cost about 50 percent less than competing products.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Google wants a price war, Mr. Selipsky said, Amazon is ready. “We’ve always been very good at making everything as low-cost as possible,” he said, “then we lower it some more.”</p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Google Concedes That Drive-by Prying Violated Privacy<span class="p"> Document NYTFEED020130313e93d0005m</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_030.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark54">BITS</a><a name="bookmark55">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Instilling a Culture At Zappos</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By QUENTIN HARDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">653 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11 March 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 6</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why do some parties, companies and cities work, while others don&#39;t? It takes some social engineering to foster serendipity and creativity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;You want to get all these creative people in a statistically small space,&#39;&#39; says Tony Hsieh, who built an effective company culture at Zappos.com, an online vendor of shoes and apparel.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If that is the goal, it is another argument for Yahoo&#39;s decision to ban people from working from home. &#39;&#39;We allow some people at Zappos to work from home, but we don&#39;t want them to,&#39;&#39; Mr. Hsieh says. &#39;&#39;We want them to come in to work.&#39;&#39; Part of his job, he says, is creating an environment where they would rather be.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Hsieh sold Zappos to Amazon.com for $1.2 billion in 2009. He continues to run it. He is also testing the lessons he learned in building Zappos in an effort to revive downtown Las Vegas, which is near Zappos&#39;s headquarters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both company building and community construction, he says, are like good parties. &#39;&#39;I was always interested in flow, and how to get people not stuck into always talking with the same people,&#39;&#39; he says. This might involve changing the entertainment, moving the bar over the course of the evening or designing the room so people move through different-size spaces.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The overall idea is to make people encounter strangers in a way that creates a sense of connection, something he instilled at Zappos. &#39;&#39;I wanted managers to spend 10 to 20 percent of their time outside of the office, leading the team,&#39;&#39; he says. Dinners, hiking and other encounters with colleagues increased productivity by a range of 20 percent to 100 percent. &#39;&#39;There was more trust, better communications, more use of shorthand in e-mails, because people weren&#39;t afraid of miscommunication,&#39;&#39; Mr. Hsieh says.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Likewise, offices were kept dense so people would bump into each other more. &#39;&#39;When someone moves twice as far away, it&#39;s exponentially less contact,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;The parking lot was behind the building, and we made people walk around from the front.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Staying physically close may be part of Marissa Mayer&#39;s plan to end working from home at Yahoo. Google, the company she comes from, is known for tight offices, frequently with three people in what normally would be space for one. This used to be ascribed to cheapness, or morale building, but it may be an effort to bolster productivity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Hsieh&#39;s effort to make these principles work for a decaying city is called the Downtown Project. In addition to financing start-up companies in the same buildings, he has opened an office where people will have to walk two blocks to their cars, so they are on the street with other people. The Downtown Project staff is moving into the Las Vegas City Hall, which is dismantling its air-cooled sky bridge so people meet other workers and townspeople in an outdoor plaza.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The apartment building he lives in, near downtown Las Vegas (historically a more tawdry and luckless place than the glitzy strip), has lots of other people from Zappos, start-ups and the Downtown Project. The building also has a number of extra places for potential investors and hires to stay a few days. Hanging around, he says, is its own recruiting tool.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Hsieh was speaking to entrepreneurs and investors at a Montgomery &amp; Company conference in Santa Monica, Calif., hoping to attract interest in downtown Las Vegas or in similar projects elsewhere.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The idea is to create collisions, co-learning and community,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s something repeatable that any city can do. You don&#39;t have to have a sports team or a big university like Harvard or Stanford.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

They were the unfortunate but revealing result of an algorithm that generates random phrases and slaps them on print-on-demand T-shirts, on the odd chance that someone might buy them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The T-shirts come from Solid Gold Bomb, a company that tried to parody the phrase “Keep Calm and Carry On,” originally the text of a World War II propaganda poster undergoing a sudden cultural renaissance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Having found its golden meme, Solid Gold Bomb wrote a computer script to churn out hundreds of T-shirt designs riffing on the phrase — “Keep Calm and Dream On” to “Keep Calm and Dance Off.” In theory, Solid Gold Bomb could be selling billions of them, for they only become “real” once an order is made. It’s the infinite monkey theorem, applied to products: with time, the algorithms would produce a T-shirt someone wants.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon does not vet such items, and Solid Gold Bomb is too solid to care. The advent of 3D printing will create an explosion in such phantom products.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Books got there first: Amazon brims with algorithmically produced “literature.” Philip M. Parker, a marketing professor, must be the most productive, erudite writer in history: Amazon lists him as author of more than 100,000 books. His secret? An algorithm to generate page-turners like “Webster’s Estonian to English Crossword Puzzles” and “The 2007-2012 Outlook for Premoistened Towelettes and Baby Wipes in Greater China” (“The moist towelette is an essential part of the lunchbox, and with the new global economy, this volume is essential,” reads its only review). Some of these books might be useful, but much of algorithmic literature exists for one reason: to swindle unsuspecting customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the former Wired editor Chris Anderson wrote of “the long tail” — the idea that, thanks to the Internet, companies can look beyond blockbusters and make money on obscure products — he never warned us it would be so long and so ugly. Somehow, well-crafted niche products have surrendered to algorithmic schlock.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But while algorithms, 3D printers and Web stores have solved the supply problem, demand-side uncertainties remain. If there are, indeed, psychopaths who want a “Keep Calm and Rape a Lot” T-shirt, how do they find it? Or, rather, how does it find them? Whoever matches existing weirdos with nonexisting weird trinkets could be the next Google.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Or could that dubious honor go to Google itself? Organizing the world’s information was just prelude to a far more important goal: becoming a universal shopping gateway. Last week’s news that it will introduce Shopping Express, a same-day delivery service to contend with Amazon, confirms the obvious: shopping is essential to Google’s future. By analyzing our information streams, it can predict what purchases make us happy, and remind us to keep shopping. It already underpins the Google’s most intriguing smartphone app, Field Trip.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A future of frictionless, continuous shopping fits with Google’s vision for a world where we no longer need to search for anything, since we ourselves are perpetually monitored, with the relevant product or information sent to us based on perceived need. “Autonomous search,” they call it.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/06/googles-director-of-engineering-ray-kurzweil-is-building-your-cybernetic-friend/" class="s1" target="_blank">Ray Kurzweil, Google’s director of engineering, even wants to give us a “</a>cybernetic friend<span class="p">” that could satisfy our wants before we are aware of them. By monitoring our conversations, e-mails and reading habits, he said, “it may pop up and say: ‘Well, you mentioned two weeks ago you were worried that vitamin B12 isn’t getting into your cells. There was new research just released two seconds ago that speaks to that.’”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To Mr. Kurzweil, who once confessed to taking 250 nutritional supplements a day, this might be a useful service. As for the rest of us, I’m not so sure: according to Google Scholar, 13,000 scientific papers and books that mention vitamin B12 came out last year alone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Google promises to quell our information hunger, that hunger will only intensify once a few seemingly innocent factoids are thrown our way. The French philosopher Michel Serres is right: “Neither information nor a drug fix ever gives any happiness when you have it, but will make you miserable when you don’t.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Google’s “cybernetic friend” will turn us into anxious information machines, our neurosis curable only by endless consumption of its recommendations. Remember Clippy, Microsoft’s annoying office assistant? The “cybernetic friend” is just like that, only on steroids and with a second job as a pushy salesman. “Keep Calm and Buy Less”: now, that’s a T-shirt it’s unlikely to recommend.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Evgeny Morozov, author of “To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism,” is a guest columnist.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document NYTFEED020130309e93a003ux</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_033.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark60">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</a><a name="bookmark61">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Reselling the E-Goods</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,309 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8 March 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The paperback of &#39;&#39;Fifty Shades of Grey&#39;&#39; is exactly like the digital version except for this: If you hate the paperback, you can give it away or resell it. If you hate the e-book, you&#39;re stuck with it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer&#39;s button might say &#39;&#39;buy now,&#39;&#39; but you are in effect only renting an e-book -- or an iTunes song -- and your rights are severely limited. That has been the bedrock distinction between physical and electronic works since digital goods became widely available a decade ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That distinction is now under attack, both in the courts and the marketplace, and it could shake up the already beleaguered book and music industries. Amazon and Apple, the two biggest forces in electronic goods, are once again at the center of the turmoil.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In late January, Amazon received a patent to set up an exchange for all sorts of digital material. The retailer would presumably earn a commission on each transaction, and consumers would surely see lower prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But a shudder went through publishers and media companies. Those who produce content might see their work devalued, just as they did when Amazon began selling secondhand books 13 years ago. The price on the Internet for many used books these days is a penny.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Thursday, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published Apple&#39;s application for its own patent for a digital marketplace. Apple&#39;s application outlines a system for allowing users to sell or give e-books, music, movies and software to each other by transferring files rather than reproducing them. Such a system would permit only one user to have a copy at any one time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, a New York court is poised to rule on whether a start-up that created a way for people to buy and sell iTunes songs is breaking copyright law. A victory for the company would mean that consumers would not need either Apple&#39;s or Amazon&#39;s exchange to resell their digital items. Electronic bazaars would spring up instantly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The technology to allow the resale of digital goods is now in place, and it will cause a dramatic upheaval,&#39;&#39; said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps, a technology consulting firm. &#39;&#39;In the short term, it&#39;s great for consumers. Over the long term, however, it could seriously reduce creators&#39; incentive to create.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Scott Turow, the best-selling novelist and president of the Authors Guild, sees immediate peril in the prospect of a secondhand digital thrift shop. &#39;&#39;The resale of e-books would send the price of new books crashing,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Who would want to be the sucker who buys the book at full price when a week later everyone else can buy it for a penny?&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">He acknowledged it would be good for consumers -- &#39;&#39;until there were no more authors anymore.&#39;&#39; Libraries, though, welcome the possibility of loosened restrictions on digital material.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The vast majority of e-books are not available in your public library,&#39;&#39; said Brandon Butler, director of public policy initiatives for the Association of Research Libraries. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s pathetic.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said that 60 percent of what the association&#39;s 125 members buy was electronic, which meant sharp restrictions on use. Libraries cannot buy from Apple&#39;s iTunes, he said. And so, for example, Pixar&#39;s Oscar-winning soundtrack for the movie &#39;&#39;Up&#39;&#39; is not available in any public collection. An Apple spokesman confirmed this.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;If these things can&#39;t be owned, who is going to make sure they exist going forward?&#39;&#39; Mr. Butler asked. &#39;&#39;Without substantial changes, we can&#39;t do what libraries have always done, which is lend and preserve.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For over a century, the ability of consumers, secondhand bookstores and libraries to do whatever they wanted with a physical book has been enshrined in law. The crucial 1908 case involved a publisher that issued a novel with a warning that no one was allowed to sell it for less than $1. When Macy&#39;s offered the book for 89 cents, the publisher sued.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling limiting the copyright owner&#39;s control to the first sale. After that, it was a free market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales of digital material are considered licenses, which give consumers little or no ability to lend the item. The worry is that without such constraints digital goods could be infinitely reproduced while still in the possession of the original owner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both the Amazon and Apple systems aim to solve this problem. Amazon&#39;s patent envisions a book or movie or song being kept in a customer&#39;s personalized &#39;&#39;data store.&#39;&#39; When an item is no longer wanted, the user could sell or trade it to another user, an action that would automatically delete the item from the first user&#39;s store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The patent describes what is essentially a gigantic swap meet. Amazon&#39;s 152 million active customers would maintain a list of desired secondhand digital objects (&#39;&#39;Django Unchained&#39;&#39; or Cheryl Strayed&#39;s &#39;&#39;Wild&#39;&#39;), as well as a list of used digital objects that are &#39;&#39;available for movement&#39;&#39; (&#39;&#39;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&#39;&#39; or Lance Armstrong&#39;s autobiography).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on the patent, including how soon or even whether the digital marketplace would be set up. The patent does not make clear if such a bazaar would need the publishers&#39; permission.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The degree to which media companies are against secondhand digital marketplaces can be seen in the music industry&#39;s hard line toward ReDigi, a Massachusetts start-up that allows for the reselling of iTunes songs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ReDigi took some pains to make its approach as friendly to the music companies as possible. For instance, any money gained from selling songs must be spent on new songs. And ReDigi says its system, like both Amazon&#39;s and Apple&#39;s, allows for only one copy of an electronic product to exist at any one moment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Capitol Records nonetheless sued ReDigi for copyright infringement in a New York federal court and asked the judge to shut the service through a preliminary injunction. The judge declined. He is expected to rule on the merits of the case shortly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Apple spokesman did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the company&#39;s patent application, which was first reported on Apple Insider. Apple, which has not sued ReDigi, declined to comment on the court case.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">John Ossenmacher, ReDigi&#39;s chief executive, said he was heartened by Amazon&#39;s resale patent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Amazon is pretty fearless, which bodes well for the consumers of digital goods.&#39;&#39; And, he added, for Amazon itself. &#39;&#39;What better value to give an Amazon customer than to say, &#39;Buy your book here and then later you can resell it&#39;? You can&#39;t do that with Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s Nook.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Robert Levine, author of &#39;&#39;Free Ride,&#39;&#39; an account of how Silicon Valley rose to power by plundering the traditional media companies, said he believed there was a cultural imperative to loosen the restrictions on digital entertainment -- but not too much.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before the Internet, he pointed out, there was little controversy over secondhand stores for books and music. &#39;&#39;It never threatened the broader market because it simply wasn&#39;t that efficient,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;You couldn&#39;t always find the book or CD you were looking for.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon, which caused an uproar with writers and publishers when it started selling used books in 2000, made it as easy as clicking a button. &#39;&#39;Digital resale would change it even more,&#39;&#39; Mr. Levine said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Markets usually move toward a solution both sides can live with, he noted. &#39;&#39;But that happens slowly, and in the meantime we&#39;re in for one hell of a fight.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A diagram accompanying Amazon&#39;s new patent for an exchange of secondhand digital material.

But if you live in a city without a car, think about subscribing to everything.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the television pilot that Cheyenne Jackson taped recently, he played an aggressive young news anchor whose ascendancy threatened an older colleague. It was a fitting metaphor for the industry itself, because while Mr.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jackson had taped pilots for the networks ABC and NBC and the cable channel USA before, this was his first time doing one for a new challenger to those alphabet networks: Amazon.com .</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Amazon sizes up the television marketplace, it sees opportunity. Internet-delivered television, which until recently was unready for prime time, is the new front in the war for the public’s attention span. Netflix , the online video rental company, is following up on the $100 million drama ‘‘House of Cards’’ with four more series this year. The computer giant Microsoft is producing programming for the Xbox video game console with the help of a former president of CBS. Other companies, including the Internet company AOL, the electronics giant Sony and the social messaging service Twitter , are likely to follow.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companies are, in effect, creating new networks for television through broadband pipes and also giving rise to new rivalries — with one another, as seen between Amazon and Netflix , and with the big but vulnerable broadcast networks as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘These are the very first lab tests in a very grand experiment,’’ said Jeff Berman, the president of BermanBraun, a media company that makes programming for the network NBC , the cable channel HGTV, AOL and the video site YouTube , among others.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As he suggested, the competition has only just begun. Amazon is making pilot episodes for at least six comedies and five children’s shows, with more to be announced soon. Sometime this spring it will put the episodes on its Amazon Prime Instant Video service and ask customers which ones they like, then order full seasons of some of them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Netflix has been ordering entire seasons of its shows without seeing pilots first. Reed Hastings, Netflix ’s chief executive, said last week that ‘‘House of Cards,’’ the political thriller starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright , had been a ‘‘great success’’ for the company. Its next program, a horror series called ‘‘Hemlock Grove’’ from the film director Eli Roth , will have its premiere in April.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microsoft has said comparatively little about its plans. But all three companies are commissioning shows because they have millions of people on monthly or yearly subscription plans. Though the shows may be loss leaders, executives say that having exclusive content increases the likelihood that existing subscribers will keep paying and that new ones will sign up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The proliferation of shows is generally seen as a good thing for viewers, who have more choices about what to watch and when, and for producers and actors, who have more places to be seen and heard. But the trend may inflame cable companies’ concerns about cord-cutting by subscribers who decide there is enough to watch online. At the same time, the rise of Internet-only shows may make viewers depend more on the broadband cord. In many cases, though, both cable and broadband are supplied by the same company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unlike the early stabs at Internet television, these shows look and feel like traditional television. That is partly because more people are watching Internet content on big-screen televisions, but it is mostly because the companies involved are throwing money at the screens: each of the Amazon comedy pilots cost the company</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">more than $1 million, according to people involved in their production, which is less than the $2 million invested in a broadcast comedy pilot, but more than is typically invested in cable pilots.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not only are the budgets comparable, so are the perks for actors and creators — like trailers and car-service pickups. The writers are guild members. The actors have what people involved say are standard television contracts, with options for several seasons if shows succeed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘There’s absolutely no difference’’ between TV and these new productions, said Jeffrey Tambor, who starred in the cable channel HBO’s ‘‘Larry Sanders Show,’’ and ‘‘Arrested Development’’ on the Fox network. Now, at 68, he is an online pioneer: this year he reprised his character for Netflix ’s new season of ‘‘Arrested,’’ which premieres in May. While taping that show, he read the script for ‘‘The Onion Presents: The News,’’ an Amazon pilot. He signed up, and played the older rival to Cheyenne Jackson.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ‘‘Onion’’ producers took over half of the newsroom of NY1, a New York news channel, in mid-February and reimagined it as the headquarters of an unscrupulous news corporation . For most of the actors there, like Mr. Jackson, a Broadway star whose television credits include ‘‘30 Rock’’ and ‘‘Glee,’’ the taping was their one pilot of the season — and thus represented a bet on Amazon over the broadcasters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Jackson recalled that his manager had called about ‘‘The Onion’’ with a note of apprehension in her voice. ‘‘It’s online,’’ she said. ‘‘We have to talk about this.’’ But when he read the script, he said, he felt confident — the tone of it reminded him of ‘‘30 Rock.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This is kind of a leap of faith,’’ he said between tapings. ‘‘We’re all taking a leap together.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts say they expect more investment to come, including from companies that do not have monthly subscribers to please. YouTube , for instance, the biggest video Web site of all, makes its money from ads, not from subscriptions. But it has paid dozens of outside producers to start channels so that it has original, professional content. And its owner, Google , can afford to pay many more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Similar logic is motivating cable channels, each of which receives a small piece of cable subscribers’ monthly payments, to come up with more dramas and sitcoms that they can call their own. This brings up a conundrum, of course: too much great TV to watch, and not enough time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Viewers find organizing and managing all of their beloved TV options to be a bit stressful,’’ said Christy Tanner, the chief executive of TVGuide.com, which conducted research that found respondents who said ‘‘it feels like work’’ and ‘‘I’m afraid of missing something.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020130305e93600039</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_036.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark66">Media Decoder</a><a name="bookmark67">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business; Media &amp; Advertising</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">WGBH to Partner on Children’s Pilot for Amazon</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By BRIAN STELTER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">421 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 March 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

Luckily, this time it was only T-shirts, not nuclear weapons.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/16/online-shoppers-are-rooting-for-the-little-guy/" class="a" target="_blank">Online Shoppers Are Rooting for the Little </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/16/online-shoppers-are-rooting-for-the-little-guy/" target="_blank">Guy</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/would-you-like-some-dog-food-with-your-diapers/" class="a" target="_blank">Would You Like Some Dog Food With Your </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/would-you-like-some-dog-food-with-your-diapers/" target="_blank">Diapers?</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/amazon-under-attack-for-sale-of-pedophile-book/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Under Attack for Sale of Pedophile </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/amazon-under-attack-for-sale-of-pedophile-book/" target="_blank">Book</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/study-shows-people-ignore-generic-photos-online/" class="a" target="_blank">Study Shows People Ignore Generic Photos </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/study-shows-people-ignore-generic-photos-online/" target="_blank">Online</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">With a Kindle Hiring Spree, Amazon Gears Up for Battle With Apple<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020130305e935003mo</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_038.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark70">Business Day; Global Business</a><a name="bookmark71">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s Labor Relations Under Scrutiny in Germany</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By JACK EWING</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,805 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 March 2013 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013.

Television crews crowded in for the money shot.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then Mr. Sauer and several other activists unfurled a banner demanding in a curious mix of German and English that Amazon, the American online retailing juggernaut, negotiate a union wage contract with its currently nonunion work force here. “Make Tarif Vertrag,” it said in fluorescent letters. Then the organizers marched toward the gates of the Amazon complex to deliver the results of an online petition drive supporting the union’s demands.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That brief bit of guerrilla theater was the latest skirmish in an escalating battle between ver.di, one of the largest unions in Germany, and Amazon, which employs 8,000 permanent workers at eight distribution centers in the country, one of the online retailer’s largest markets outside the United States. Deservedly or not, Amazon’s labor relations have lately come under intense scrutiny by German media.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The triggering event was a Feb. 12 broadcast by one of Germany’s two main public television networks of a documentary about the treatment of some of the 10,000 temporary workers that Amazon hired last year to cope with the holiday rush. Many of those workers were bused in from countries like Spain or Romania where jobs are scarce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aired on ARD, a publicly financed broadcaster considered left of center, the documentary even implied that Amazon used neo-Nazi thugs to keep workers in line. It showed a team of security workers hired by an Amazon subcontractor roughing up a camera crew outside the temporary workers’ quarters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The broadcast has since inspired countless headlines, preoccupied pundits on Germany’s ubiquitous television talk shows and may even become an issue in national elections this autumn in which left-leaning Social Democrats will be challenging the government coalition led by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The continuing furor raises the question of whether Amazon will be the latest big American company to run afoul of German labor laws, which provide much broader worker rights than in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart abandoned Germany in 2006 following an array of setbacks that included a legal struggle with ver.di, which represents two million workers in service industries including retailing, hotels, food service and public transportation. The name is an abbreviation of Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft, or United Service Industries Union.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Motor’s Opel unit, represented by the IG Metall union in Germany, has struggled for more than a decade to cut costs and stem losses in the face of strong worker resistance. Last week, Opel finally struck a truce with its employees that will allow it to close a factory in Bochum, Germany, in 2016 — but only after promising not to impose involuntary layoffs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now it seems to be Amazon’s turn to serve as a symbol for everything that many Germans resent about American-style management and so-called Anglo-Saxon capitalism. As an American company that has helped drive at least one German competitor out of business and makes heavy use of temporary workers, Amazon is a ripe target.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">More flexible job regulations, introduced since 2005, have contributed to a plunge in unemployment. Germany’s</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5.3 percent jobless rate is less than half the euro zone’s overall rate of 11.9 percent. But the changes are perceived by many Germans as creating a class of poorly paid workers with few protections. Amazon’s work force more than doubles every Christmas season when it hires an additional 10,000 temporary employees, many of them foreigners.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which already pays above the union rate, has refused to negotiate with the ver.di union on wages or any other issue. But so far Amazon seems to be doing a better job than Walmart did in German public relations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of the security agents in the documentary who manhandled a camera crew wore clothing fashionable among neo-Nazis. The name of the security firm, as the film made clear, was also provocative: H.E.S.S., for Hensel European Security Service. Rudolf Hess, one of Adolf Hitler’s deputies, remains a revered figure among right-wing extremists.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">The firm denied any connection to extremist groups. But Amazon fired the security firm, nonetheless. “We are unhappy at what we saw,” Dave Clark, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide operations, said by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">telephone from Seattle on Saturday. “We’ve got to become world class in managing the accommodations of those</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">folks versus delegating to a third party. That is a lesson we learned this holiday.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Heiner Reimann, a ver.di official, said that every year after Christmas he is flooded with complaints from temporary workers who say they were falsely led to believe they would get permanent jobs at Amazon if they met tough productivity requirements. He said that the nebulous status of temporary workers at Amazon is a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">year-round issue, but especially so right after the holiday, when large numbers of temps are let go.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Mr. Clark countered that virtually all of Amazon’s permanent employees in Germany started out as temporary workers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said Amazon was not importing the foreign workers portrayed in the television documentary because they were inexpensive, but because the company could not find enough people locally. Unemployment in Bad Hersfeld and the surrounding area is about 5 percent. “If we had the ability to staff with local people we would have done it,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has expanded rapidly in Germany in recent years, generating $8.7 billion in the country last year as it provided Germans with a consumer cornucopia of everything from books and MP3 players to vacuum cleaners and kayaks. Of the company’s eight distribution warehouses in Germany, which it calls fulfillment centers, six have opened since 2009. And more hiring is planned, Mr. Clark said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the union’s other criticisms is that a Big Brother atmosphere prevails in Amazon distribution centers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Everything is measured, everything is calculated, everything is geared toward efficiency,” Mr. Reimann said. “People want to be treated with respect.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon also has its defenders in Bad Hersfeld, where the company is one of the main employers in this city of 30,000, optimally located in central Germany at the junction of two major highways.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thomas Fehling, the mayor, said he condemned poor treatment of temporary workers reported in the German press. But he added, “We have a very positive feeling about Amazon,” which employs 2,500 people here.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://kreisanzeiger-online.de/2013/02/22/ka-leser-der-bei-amazon-arbeitete-die-stimmung-in-der-halle-war-nie-gut/" class="s1" target="_blank">Among local citizens, opinion about Amazon seems to be split.

The German operation offers a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">mind-boggling assortment of products that besides clothing, sporting goods and home electronics includes more than 50 varieties of fondue sets. The products are fetched from storage racks by workers known as pickers, who may cover miles on foot in the course of a workday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Customer orders are packed largely by hand, with productivity of individual employees closely monitored by software on the hand-held scanners workers use, and other means. “Feedback” sessions are held for those deemed insufficiently swift.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Our intent is not to spy with electronics, or to monitor with electronics in a punitive way,” Mr. Clark said. “We do expect our employees to perform.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s relentless focus on efficiency enables it to deliver most products the next day and often beat competitors on price. Neckermann, once among the largest catalog retailers in Germany, became insolvent last year in part because it was unable to compete successfully with Amazon online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A taxi driver in Bad Hersfeld, who did not want to be quoted by name because a close relative is still employed by Amazon, said he had worked as a picker one Christmas season and found the work demanding but not unreasonably so. It was less stressful than driving a taxi, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Fehling, the mayor, frames things in business terms. “If you want a comfortable job, Amazon is definitely not for you,” he said. “Amazon is a performance-oriented company. Amazon is successful because people want those products and they want those prices.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is no sign yet that the controversy stirred by the documentary is cooling.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeRofG353tU&amp;feature=youtu.be" class="s1" target="_blank">Peer Steinbrück, leader of the Social Democrats, the largest party challenging Ms. Merkel’s governing coalition, has recorded a </a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeRofG353tU&amp;feature=youtu.be" class="a" target="_blank">video message</a> <a href="http://www.change.org/de/Petitionen/amazon-deutschland-verbessern-sie-die-arbeitsbedingungen-ihrer-leiharbeiter" class="s1" target="_blank">in support of the </a><a href="http://www.change.org/de/Petitionen/amazon-deutschland-verbessern-sie-die-arbeitsbedingungen-ihrer-leiharbeiter" class="a" target="_blank">online petition drive</a> <span style=" color: #000;">calling on Amazon to negotiate with the union.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“A strong company like Amazon doesn’t need to use poor working conditions to create a competitive advantage,” Mr. Steinbrück says in the video. He promises that, if elected, he will tighten rules governing temporary workers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Mr. Clark of Amazon said a union contract would not allow the company to pursue what it considers an innovative compensation system, which includes stock bonuses for all workers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s policy of neither confronting nor engaging with the union was evident on Thursday, when the small group of ver.di organizers, including Mr. Reimann and Mr. Sauer with his Jeff Bezos prop, gathered outside the gates to one of Amazon’s distribution centers on a hillside outside Bad Hersfeld.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">They had come to present 37,000 signatures gathered online. The activists were far outnumbered by reporters and camera crews, drawn by the prospect of a telegenic confrontation with management. But Amazon, it soon became clear, had decided to defuse the moment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Reimann pressed a buzzer next to the security gate. When a voice over the intercom asked who was calling, he demanded to be admitted to deliver the signatures.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unexpectedly, the gate opened, and Mr. Reimann and the other ver.di activists tramped across an enclosed metal bridge, trailed by journalists.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They were met inside by a trio of friendly receptionists, who cheerily issued visitor passes to everyone. Nearby, a table was piled with bananas and a sign, “Amazon Fruit Day.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As Mr. Reimann gave interviews to television reporters, photographers snapped Amazon workers on their way to a nearby cafeteria.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But soon came word: No Amazon officials would be meeting with Mr. Reimann’s group this day. So the activists handed their box of signatures to the ever-beaming receptionists, and everyone left.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.

But Amazon fired the security firm, nonetheless. &#39;&#39;We are unhappy at what we saw,&#39;&#39; Dave Clark, Amazon&#39;s vice president of worldwide operations, said by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">telephone from Seattle on Saturday. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve got to become world class in managing the accommodations of those</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">folks versus delegating to a third party. That is a lesson we learned this holiday.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Heiner Reimann, a ver.di official, said that every year after Christmas he is flooded with complaints from temporary workers who say they were falsely led to believe they would get permanent jobs at Amazon if they met tough productivity requirements. He said that the nebulous status of temporary workers at Amazon is a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">year-round issue, but especially so right after the holiday, when large numbers of temps are let go.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Mr. Clark countered that virtually all of Amazon&#39;s permanent employees in Germany started out as temporary workers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said Amazon was not importing the foreign workers portrayed in the television documentary because they were inexpensive, but because the company could not find enough people locally. Unemployment in Bad Hersfeld and the surrounding area is about 5 percent. &#39;&#39;If we had the ability to staff with local people we would have done it,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has expanded rapidly in Germany in recent years, generating $8.7 billion in the country last year as it provided Germans with a consumer cornucopia of everything from books and MP3 players to vacuum cleaners and kayaks. Of the company&#39;s eight distribution warehouses in Germany, which it calls fulfillment centers, six have opened since 2009. And more hiring is planned, Mr. Clark said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the union&#39;s other criticisms is that a Big Brother atmosphere prevails in Amazon distribution centers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Everything is measured, everything is calculated, everything is geared toward efficiency,&#39;&#39; Mr. Reimann said. &#39;&#39;People want to be treated with respect.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon also has its defenders in Bad Hersfeld, where the company is one of the main employers in this city of 30,000, optimally located in central Germany at the junction of two major highways.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thomas Fehling, the mayor, said he condemned poor treatment of temporary workers reported in the German press. But he added, &#39;&#39;We have a very positive feeling about Amazon,&#39;&#39; which employs 2,500 people here.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among local citizens, opinion about Amazon seems to be split. Some former employees writing to the Kreis Anzeiger, a local newspaper, complained of an unpleasant work atmosphere and extreme pressure to produce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But one, who said he had worked 12 years for the company, disagreed. &#39;&#39;The work climate was and is always good,&#39;&#39; he wrote, &#39;&#39;and the co-workers as well as the lead managers are fine.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For all its digital efficiencies, online commerce can be labor intensive. The German operation offers a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">mind-boggling assortment of products that besides clothing, sporting goods and home electronics includes more than 50 varieties of fondue sets. The products are fetched from storage racks by workers known as pickers, who may cover miles on foot in the course of a workday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Customer orders are packed largely by hand, with productivity of individual employees closely monitored by software on the hand-held scanners workers use, and other means. &#39;&#39;Feedback&#39;&#39; sessions are held for those deemed insufficiently swift.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Our intent is not to spy with electronics, or to monitor with electronics in a punitive way,&#39;&#39; Mr. Clark said. &#39;&#39;We do expect our employees to perform.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s relentless focus on efficiency enables it to deliver most products the next day and often beat competitors on price. Neckermann, once among the largest catalog retailers in Germany, became insolvent last year in part because it was unable to compete successfully with Amazon online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A taxi driver in Bad Hersfeld, who did not want to be quoted by name because a close relative is still employed by Amazon, said he had worked as a picker one Christmas season and found the work demanding but not unreasonably so. It was less stressful than driving a taxi, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Fehling, the mayor, frames things in business terms. &#39;&#39;If you want a comfortable job, Amazon is definitely not for you,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Amazon is a performance-oriented company. Amazon is successful because people want those products and they want those prices.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is no sign yet that the controversy stirred by the documentary is cooling.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Peer Steinbrück, leader of the Social Democrats, the largest party challenging Ms. Merkel&#39;s governing coalition, has recorded a video message in support of the online petition drive calling on Amazon to negotiate with the union.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;A strong company like Amazon doesn&#39;t need to use poor working conditions to create a competitive advantage,&#39;&#39; Mr. Steinbrück says in the video. He promises that, if elected, he will tighten rules governing temporary workers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Mr. Clark of Amazon said a union contract would not allow the company to pursue what it considers an innovative compensation system, which includes stock bonuses for all workers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s policy of neither confronting nor engaging with the union was evident on Thursday, when the small group of ver.di organizers, including Mr. Reimann and Mr. Sauer with his Jeff Bezos prop, gathered outside the gates to one of Amazon&#39;s distribution centers on a hillside outside Bad Hersfeld.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">They had come to present 37,000 signatures gathered online. The activists were far outnumbered by reporters and camera crews, drawn by the prospect of a telegenic confrontation with management. But Amazon, it soon became clear, had decided to defuse the moment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Reimann pressed a buzzer next to the security gate. When a voice over the intercom asked who was calling, he demanded to be admitted to deliver the signatures.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unexpectedly, the gate opened, and Mr. Reimann and the other ver.di activists tramped across an enclosed metal bridge, trailed by journalists.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They were met inside by a trio of friendly receptionists, who cheerily issued visitor passes to everyone. Nearby, a table was piled with bananas and a sign, &#39;&#39;Amazon Fruit Day.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As Mr. Reimann gave interviews to television reporters, photographers snapped Amazon workers on their way to a nearby cafeteria.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But soon came word: No Amazon officials would be meeting with Mr. Reimann&#39;s group this day. So the activists handed their box of signatures to the ever-beaming receptionists, and everyone left.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Activists protest Amazon&#39;s treatment of employees in Germany, where workers enjoy greater rights than in the United States.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Target and Best Buy have made it pretty clear they are fighting back against the phenomenon of showrooming, in which customers browse for television sets and other products in stores and then buy them online from Amazon and other etailers for less. Both companies recently made their seasonal practices of matching prices at online retailers a year-round policy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A new study of Amazon customers who research products in stores by Placed, a mobile analytics company, offers some insight into who else could be at the greatest risk of losing business to showrooming. The study relies on Placed&#39;s panel of more than 14,000 mobile phone users who consent to have their locations tracked in exchange for store gift cards and other perks. Placed can tell when those people visit a particular retailer without them having to proactively report their store visits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mobile phones are an indispensable tool of showroomers for comparing prices. Amazon has even given users of its mobile shopping app the ability to simplify price lookups on its site by letting them scan product bar codes using their smartphone cameras.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among the people on its panel who reported buying items on Amazon after looking at the same item in physical stores, Placed found that Bed Bath and Beyond, PetSmart and Toys &#39;R&#39; Us were the retailers that Amazon showroomers visited the most, with Amazon showroomers 27 percent, 25 percent and 21 percent more likely to visit the three stores, respectively, than the average consumer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Placed examined Amazon showroomers by gender, it found Best Buy, the Home Depot and Lowe&#39;s were the three retailers men were most likely to visit, while Kohl&#39;s, PetSmart and Bed Bath and Beyond held the top spots for women.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jon Sandler, a spokesman for Best Buy, said &#39;&#39;showrooming is now dead to us&#39;&#39; because of the company&#39;s recent decision to make matching of prices at online retailers permanent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another interesting nugget in Placed&#39;s study shows how much overlap there is between Amazon&#39;s Prime customers, who get free two-day shipping and other benefits for an annual fee, and other membership-based retailers. People who told Placed that they were Amazon Prime customers were 45 percent more likely to visit Costco and 39 percent more likely to visit BJ&#39;s Wholesale Club than the average shopper.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s possible that at some point those shoppers might choose to ditch their memberships at physical stores as Amazon offers more goods and delivery service that more directly compete with the instant gratification and selection of its offline competitors. For now, though, a lot of people seem to be choosing Amazon Prime without sacrificing other store memberships.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

On the Kindle Fire HD, swipe your finger down on the screen to get to the settings area and tap More. Tap Parental Controls and then tap the On button. Select a password (one that will be needed to unlock the restrictions), and tap the Finish button. Select the apps and actions you want to block, like the Web browser, e-mail, video playback or the power to make purchases. Amazon has more information on parental controls here.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The newer Kindle Fire HD models also include Kindle FreeTime, an app that lets you select videos, apps and other specific content the child can view on the tablet.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Three independent, brick-and-mortar bookstores have filed a lawsuit against Amazon and the big six publishers, claiming that they are violating antitrust laws by collaborating to keep small sellers out of the e-book market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a lawsuit filed on Friday in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Book House of Stuyvesant Plaza and Posman Books, both based in New York, and Fiction Addiction, based in South Carolina, alleged that they and other small bookstores were being deliberately forced out of the digital market as a result of agreements between the big publishers and Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The contracts entered into between Amazon and the Big Six,&quot; the complaint said, constitute &quot;a series of contracts and/or combinations among and between the defendants which unreasonably restrain trade and commerce in the market of e-books sold within the United States.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At the heart of the lawsuit is the idea that the top publishers signed secret contracts with Amazon that allowed them to code their e-books in such a way that the books could only be read on an Amazon Kindle device or a device with a Kindle app. The booksellers are pushing for open-source coding that would allow readers to buy e-books from any source and download them on any device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They argue that the proprietary coding compels consumers who own Kindles or tablets with Kindle apps to buy e-books only from Amazon. The lawsuit states that the publishers have no similar contracts with independent booksellers. It also notes that Apple once used similar exclusive coding, known as DRM, in the music business, but that after a series of legal challenges, all music available on iTunes was made DRM-free.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The booksellers are seeking an immediate injunction to the practice, as well as damages.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The six publishers named were Random House, Penguin, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Simon &amp; Schuster and Hachette.

He said the security guards in question would be confronted about the accusations and that appropriate action would be taken.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Reimann said Amazon should seek to set a good example in Germany of how to combine the use of temporary workers with high standards, and should be aware of certain historical sensitivities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We are talking about Polish workers who were kept in a holiday camp with a fence around it and were being watched by guards,&#39;&#39; Mr. Reimann said in a telephone interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We are in Germany,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We have a certain history to respect.&#39;&#39; Document NYTF000020130216e92g0004c</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_048.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark90">A</a><a name="bookmark91">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">AMAZON TO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS OF WORKER INTIMIDATION AT DISTRIBUTOR IN GERMANY</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MELISSA EDDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">45 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16 February 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Major storms like Hurricane Sandy and other unexpected events have prompted some companies to modify the popular just-in-time style of doing business, in which only small amounts of inventory are kept on hand, to fashion what is known as just-in-case management.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The shift has led retailers and logistics companies to alter supply chains by adding distribution hubs, according to the CoStar Group, a real estate research firm in Washington. In turn, the hubs are creating real estate opportunities in markets on and off established distribution paths, including growth in markets outside the traditional seaport hubs on the East and West Coasts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just-in-case planning helps retailers keep merchandise on store shelves in the event a supply chain disruption affects one of the major distribution markets. Hurricane Sandy affected the ports of New York and New Jersey, for example, and the 2002 lockout of International Longshore and Warehouse Union workers from West Coast seaports delayed the unloading of container ships for months.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just-in-case is a response to the vulnerability of just-in-time supply chains, said Rene Circ, CoStar&#39;s director of industrial research. Since the 1990s, just-in-time has made sense for many companies looking to reduce the cost of keeping large inventories on hand. Technology enabled retailers and manufacturers to closely track and ship items to replace merchandise sold or components consumed in production.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This model also reduced transportation costs, because goods would be shipped only as necessary. By combining the just-in-case with just-in-time strategy, Mr. Circ said, companies are trying to strike a balance between &#39;&#39;carrying the minimum inventory possible, yet never running out of things, because inventory equals cost.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For example, Ranger Steel, a company based in Houston that describes itself as the largest privately owned steel plate distributor in the nation, recently expanded its network of distribution centers. Until the late 1990s, Ranger Steel regularly trucked its heavy steel plates directly from a distribution center at the Port of Houston to customers throughout the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;For a long time that concept worked like a charm,&#39;&#39; said Jochen Seeba, the company&#39;s vice president and chief operating officer. &#39;&#39;Then you started to see the spike in fuel pricing, and new governmental rules and regulations on insurance coverage for truck drivers that made truck transportation very expensive.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like many retailers and wholesale suppliers, Ranger Steel in recent years has added distribution centers to its network, cutting delivery times by moving its inventory closer to customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Today, suppliers ship steel in bulk to Ranger Steel&#39;s seven distribution centers around the country. From there, drivers can deliver orders to most of the company&#39;s customers in 24 hours, leveling the playing field with local competitors in markets like St. Louis, where the firm opened a distribution center last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reduced transportation cost is a secondary benefit, Mr. Seeba said. The more significant advantage is the ability to serve and retain customers better in an increasingly competitive marketplace, in which a three-day delivery time to St. Louis from Houston is no longer acceptable. &#39;&#39;You have to adjust your model,&#39;&#39; Mr. Seeba said, &#39;&#39;and that&#39;s what we have done.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With just-in-time management, smaller on-site inventories put companies at greater risk of running out of merchandise in the event of a disruption. Shaw Lupton, CoStar&#39;s senior real estate economist, said companies were trying to mitigate that risk by diversifying supply chains into multiple distribution centers. As evidence, he pointed to a long-term shift of cargo flows from West Coast to East Coast seaports, and a slowdown of the rate at which the largest warehouse markets have captured market share over the past decade.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some researchers say that retailers, in particular, are under competitive pressure to establish distribution centers near major population centers. Many states have begun to require online retailers to pay sales tax, making it difficult to compete with brick-and-mortar stores on price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In an effort to gain an advantage, online retailers are increasingly offering rapid shipping from nearby distribution centers, Mr. Circ said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s driving this reconfiguration of supply chains and the building of these large warehouses, not just in a few key markets as it used to be, but a lot more widely spread&#39;&#39; across the country, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The closer to the customer that a company can transport its goods in bulk, the greater the efficiency and cost savings, said Tim Feemster, senior managing director at the Dallas branch of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, a real estate company. Multiple, well-placed distribution centers minimize the time and distance spent on the final leg of delivery, when trucks are often nearly empty while transporting individual items. &#39;&#39;The final mile is the most expensive cost per pound or cost per piece,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Retailers sometimes avoid that final-mile delivery by inviting online shoppers to pick up their purchases from nearby stores, Mr. Feemster said. In those cases, the store functions as a distribution center.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The tendency toward numerous distribution facilities runs contrary to a strategy that was common just after the recession, when some companies sought efficiency by consolidating warehouse operations, according to Bob Martie, executive vice president for the New Jersey region at Colliers International, a real estate service provider.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;As competition is growing, companies are seeing the need to have better customer service,&#39;&#39; Mr. Martie said. &#39;&#39;Five years ago, one might need two distribution centers to effectively manage the country; now that number seems to be five to seven.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Or more, for the largest online retailers. On Jan. 30, for example, Amazon.com announced plans to open three fulfillment centers in Texas, each measuring more than one million square feet. In 2012, the company introduced the development of fulfillment centers in Dupont, Wash., and in Middletown, Del., and made a half-dozen similar announcements the previous year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The redesign of supply chains has introduced some new distribution paths. The Hillwood Development Company, based in Fort Worth, will develop two of Amazon&#39;s fulfillment centers in Texas, including one at AllianceTexas, Hillwood&#39;s 17,000-acre master-planned community north of Fort Worth that is a nexus of rail service, airfreight and highway access. The second will be near Dallas, in Coppell; USAA Real Estate Company is developing the third center just northeast of San Antonio.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Plenty of companies need to establish and maintain distribution centers in smaller markets, too, according to Benjamin Butcher, chief executive of STAG Industrial in Boston. STAG owns and manages more than 29 million square feet of single-tenant industrial properties in 31 states.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Butcher said that companies were generally reluctant to make major adjustments to an established supply chain. &#39;&#39;In the tenants we&#39;re dealing with, there is a lot of stability,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;They don&#39;t tend to move unless there is a fairly strong and valid business reason to do it.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A crane operator, left, moving containers between rail cars and truck trailers at a terminal in Haslet, Tex., near the location where Amazon is developing a distribution center.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Slowly but confidently, Amazon is building a library of television shows and movies to rival that of Netflix, much to the satisfaction of media companies like Time Warner and CBS, whose executives love to see the competition.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although Amazon will not unveil its own original television shows until the fall at the earliest, it is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to have the exclusive Web rights to shows it can brag about on its Amazon Prime streaming service, like &quot;Downton Abbey,&quot; from PBS, and &quot;Falling Skies,&quot; from TNT.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The latest example came on Monday, when Amazon announced an unusual arrangement with CBS, the country&#39;s most-watched television network, to carry episodes of &quot;Under the Dome&quot; just days after the series makes its debut on TV in June.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This deal is yet another sign that the streaming marketplace is becoming more and more robust,&quot; said Scott Koondel, the chief content licensing officer for CBS, a position that was created two months ago. &quot;Advances in user-friendly technology from companies like Amazon and Netflix are a boon for premium content owners.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has a long way to go to rival Netflix in terms of TV and movie selection. But in some corners of the media business, it is already perceived to be Pepsi to Netflix&#39;s Coke. And many other companies - among them Google, Sony, Intel and a new joint venture between Redbox and Verizon - are trying to come up with a Red Bull or a Snapple they can call their own.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Netflix has won attention for unveiling a high quality show, &quot;House of Cards,&quot; on its streaming service, &quot;it is increasingly hard to ignore the progress Amazon has made in a relatively short amount of time,&quot; Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research, wrote two weeks ago. He predicted that Amazon would quietly spend more than $500 million on video this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon declined to comment on that figure. Its nearly two-year-old streaming service, called Prime Instant Video, is bundled as part of its $79 annual Amazon Prime membership, which also provides two-day free shipping and a monthly Kindle e-book rental. The company says it has millions of Amazon Prime subscribers, but it will not disclose the precise number. Netflix has about 27 million streaming subscribers in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instant Video started simply enough about two years ago, with relatively cheap acquisitions of older television shows from networks like CBS and nonexclusive rights to older films from studios like Universal. But Amazon&#39;s recent deals have revealed the company&#39;s ambitions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Netflix dropped the rights to some cable series like &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; last fall, Amazon swooped in and started streaming them. When Time Warner wanted to sell streams of some of its cable dramas, Amazon bought the exclusive rights to &quot;The Closer&quot; and &quot;Falling Skies,&quot; while Netflix bought &quot;Dallas.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This emerging back end for cable originals is a very promising sign,&quot; Jeffrey L. Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, told investors last week, &quot;since it should result in production values for cable originals getting even better over time.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps its biggest deal yet came last week, when it clinched the rights to past and future seasons of the PBS hit &quot;Downton Abbey.&quot; By July, &quot;Downton&quot; will be gone from Netflix.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both streaming services mine the data of their users to determine what kinds of shows to license, and what not to. The first two seasons of &quot;Downton&quot; were the &quot;most-streamed TV show on Prime Instant Video,&quot; said Brad Beale, who oversees video acquisitions for Amazon, so it was a &quot;pretty easy decision&quot; to bid for seasons three and four (and five, if it is produced).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Data is a great proxy for what our customers love,&quot; Mr. Beale added in a telephone interview. &quot;We&#39;re blessed to have a platform that gives us a lot of insight into what our customers love.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Under the Dome&quot; - based on the Stephen King novel and produced by Steven Spielberg&#39;s Amblin Television - will be unique because each episode will go onto Amazon four days after its premiere on TV. CBS stands to make more money this way than it now does by streaming shows on CBS.com and attaching ads.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts expect to see more such deals as broadcasters move away from the free online model made popular by Hulu. Hulu has a subscription component as well, but it has not announced any notable licensing deals the way Netflix and Amazon have done. Its owners are at odds over the future of the service, and its founding chief executive, Jason Kilar, will leave later this winter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Netflix says it expects to compete with Amazon the way HBO and Showtime compete - with TV dramas and comedies of their own. &quot;When it comes to competition, we not only have a superior content offering due to our larger budget, but we are further along the experience curve,&quot; Netflix told investors last month. In other words, Amazon is cheap, off-brand Cola.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Netflix has four more original series on tap this year, Amazon is trying out test episodes of six comedies and five children&#39;s series. This year, Amazon will stream them and, after hearing from viewers, decide which ones will become series.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Roy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, said the pilot process will ensure quality, just as it does for traditional television networks, and make viewers and producers pay attention to Amazon&#39;s video projects.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;All that matters is being great,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#39;s no great benefit in being good; people don&#39;t change their habits for good.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon raised the ante last week when it won the rights to past and future seasons of the PBS hit &#39;&#39;Downton Abbey.&#39;&#39; By July, the series will be gone from Netflix.

All rights reserved 7:31 p.m. | Updated</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Macmillan said on Friday that it had agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by the Justice Department over the pricing of e-books, asserting that the potential costs of continuing to fight the action were too high.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The agreement means that all five of the major publishing houses named in the suit have settled. The government accused them last spring of colluding with one another to set the price of e-books artificially high.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple, which is also a defendant, will continue to trial in June, according to the Justice Department. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Macmillan is the smallest of the major publishers. In a letter addressed to authors, illustrators and agents, the company&#39;s chief executive, John Sargent, said that the risks were too great to go it alone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Our company is not large enough to risk a worst-case judgment,&quot; he said, while emphasizing that Macmillan did not believe it had engaged in collusion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;A few weeks ago I got an estimate of the maximum possible damage figure,&quot; Mr. Sargent said. &quot;I cannot share the breathtaking amount with you, but it was much more than the entire equity of our company.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the suit, filed in April, the Justice Department accused five of the six biggest publishers and Apple of conspiring in e-mails and over lavish dinners to set the price of e-books. The publishers had moved from a wholesale pricing model, which let retailers charge what they wanted, to a system that allowed publishers to set their own e-book prices, a model known as agency pricing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The defendants said they had tried to protect themselves from Amazon, which was pricing e-books below their actual cost, including many for $9.99, putting financial pressure on the publishers that they said would drive them out of business. The dispute underscored the extent to which competition from digital retailers like Amazon was transforming the traditional book industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Three publishing houses, HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster and Hachette, settled with the government immediately. Penguin, Macmillan and Apple decided to fight the charges. But in December, to clear the way for its merger with Random House, Penguin settled, too. Random House was not named in the suit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The terms of the Macmillan settlement, which is subject to court approval, mirror those agreed to by the other publishers. Macmillan will immediately lift restrictions it has imposed on discounting and other promotions by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-book retailers. Reduced prices could be available to consumers as early as next Monday. The company will be prohibited until December 2014 from entering into new agreements with similar restrictions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The publisher must also notify the government in advance about any e-book ventures it plans with other publishers. And for five years, it will be prohibited from agreeing to any kind of so-called most-favored nation clause with any retailer, meaning that no other retailer is allowed to sell e-books for a lower price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Macmillan had been holding firm that it would not settle, and analysts offered varying explanations for the sudden turnabout. James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said potential merger talks might be one motivation. The publishing industry has begun to consolidate to respond to the threat from Amazon, and when</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Penguin and Random House announced in October that they would merge, it fed speculation that more alliances would follow.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This was a fight not worth fighting in the first place,&quot; Dr. McQuivey said of the lawsuit, &quot;and given the likely nature of merger conversations behind the scenes, that&#39;s where you finally decide the litigation is an obstacle to those talks, which are much more important.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But Mike Shatzkin, founder and chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a publishing consultant, played down the role of a potential merger. &quot;There have been no rumors and no signs that Macmillan is merging,&quot; he said. &quot;I would actually take their statement at face value.&quot; He said he thought it was more likely that Macmillan realized that its stand on pricing was having no effect on the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">E-book prices have been declining steadily, but not precipitously, since the settlement with the first three publishers went into effect in September. &quot;Their settling doesn&#39;t change the overall market,&quot; Mr. Shatzkin said, &quot;and it looks much more that way to them now than when they were originally fighting.&quot;</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/judge-approves-e-book-pricing-settlement-between-government-and-publishers/" class="a" target="_blank">Judge Approves E-Book Pricing Settlement Between Government and </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/judge-approves-e-book-pricing-settlement-between-government-and-publishers/" target="_blank">Publishers</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/awaiting-merger-with-random-house-penguin-settles-ebook-case/" class="a" target="_blank">Awaiting Merger With Random House, Penguin Settles E-Book </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/awaiting-merger-with-random-house-penguin-settles-ebook-case/" target="_blank">Case</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/bookish-new-web-site-provides-information-on-books-and-authors/" class="a" target="_blank">Bookish, New Web Site, Provides Information on Books and </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/bookish-new-web-site-provides-information-on-books-and-authors/" target="_blank">Authors</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/harpercollins-reaches-new-agreements-with-amazon-and-others-on-e-book-prices/" class="a" target="_blank">HarperCollins Reaches New Agreements With Amazon and Others on E-Book </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/harpercollins-reaches-new-agreements-with-amazon-and-others-on-e-book-prices/" target="_blank">Prices</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Justice Dept.

How do I make sure all of my personal content is erased before I give the old Kindle away?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Kindle software includes a setting that wipes the tablet and returns it to the state it was in when you first took it out of the box. Before you start the process, though, check that the Kindle has a good battery charge so it does not conk out in the middle of erasing itself, and make sure you have any personal files you need on the device backed up elsewhere.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Next, tap the gear-shaped icon for the Settings menu. On the Settings menu, tap the More icon, scroll down and then tap Device. At the bottom of the Device screen, tap the option called Reset to Factory Defaults. In the Factory Data Reset box that pops up, tap the Erase Everything button.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you tap Erase Everything, the Kindle does just that - it deregisters the tablet with your Amazon account and deletes any personal files you have copied to it. It also wipes out any movies, books, music, apps and other content you purchased on the device. (Although your personal files are erased, any Amazon purchases you made on the Kindle are backed up to Amazon&#39;s cloud servers and can be used with the new Kindle registered to your account.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once the Kindle finishes erasing itself, it should reboot. When the tablet finishes restarting, you should see the Welcome screen that invites you to set up the Kindle Fire as a new device.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/qa-reading-google-books-on-an-iphone/" class="a" target="_blank">Q&amp;A: Reading Google Books on an </a><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/qa-reading-google-books-on-an-iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/qa-resetting-a-kindles-automatic-bookmark/" class="a" target="_blank">Q&amp;A: Resetting a Kindle&#39;s Automatic </a><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/qa-resetting-a-kindles-automatic-bookmark/" target="_blank">Bookmark</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/qa-borrowing-e-books-from-the-library/" class="a" target="_blank">Q&amp;A: Borrowing E-Books from the </a><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/qa-borrowing-e-books-from-the-library/" target="_blank">Library</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/05/qa-declining-a-kindles-special-offers/" class="a" target="_blank">Q&amp;A: Declining a Kindle&#39;s Special </a><a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/05/qa-declining-a-kindles-special-offers/" target="_blank">Offers</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Q&amp;A: Shutting Down a Missing Kindle<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020130201e921002bd</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_055.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark104">Technology</a><a name="bookmark105">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Analysts See the Good in Amazon’s Poor Results</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">935 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30 January 2013 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013.

Oh, and expect a miserable first quarter, too.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shares in Amazon immediately jumped nearly 10 percent in after-hours trading, about the same amount that Apple fell after releasing its news.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What caught the eye of investors was that operating margins as a percent of consolidated sales rose to 3.2 percent, from 2.7 percent a year ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The carrot for Amazon investors is improvements to margin over time,” said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. Apple, on the other hand, would need to build a cheaper iPhone to keep growing as fast as it has been, which would slice into its margins.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For more than a decade, Amazon has teetered between minimal profits and no profits. In 2012, it said Tuesday, it lost money. But Wall Street has always been more about promises than results, and Amazon is always on the verge of converting its overwhelming online presence into buckets of cash.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“As long as the dream is there, the stock is going to go up,” Mr. Munster said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The short-term news Tuesday was not good. Earnings per share fell to 21 cents from 38 cents in the fourth quarter of 2011. Although fourth-quarter revenue went up 22 percent to $21.27 billion, both revenue and earnings did not meet expectations. Analysts had predicted revenue of $22.2 billion and earnings of 27 cents a share.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Forget about all that. What mattered was the improvement in margin.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has had plenty of opportunities to raise its margins in the past, but has instead routinely chosen to reward customers with subsidized shipping and higher discounts. In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Tom Szkutak, Amazon’s chief financial officer, repeated this mantra.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investors took some time to buy into this idea. “Wall Street gets in a kerfuffle when we lower product prices and invest heavily in the future,” Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, acknowledged in 2005, at a point when the stock had tumbled 40 percent in less than a year. “So don’t buy our stock — instead buy our products and enjoy our investments.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That was bad advice. The stock is up almost 700 percent since then, hitting a record this month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shares in Amazon fell nearly $16 in regular trading Tuesday, to $260.35. After-hours, shares went up more than</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$22.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jason Moser, an analyst with the Motley Fool, who owns shares in the retailer, said that “many investors, myself included, will more than likely watch this story play out for as long as it takes.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Moser added in an e-mail message that the market was “betting a lot on what Amazon hasn’t done yet and betting on the fact that it will do it based on what it’s doing now.” He added, “Kind of a ‘build it and they will come’ sort of thing.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some analysts are still skeptical.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It’s much easier to sell goods at cost the way Amazon does than sell goods at a 40 percent margin like Apple,” said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. “Once you’ve trained your customers to buy at cost, it’s difficult to train them away from it.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, Mr. Gillis said: “Who’s going to undercut Amazon? They’re only making half a cent on every dollar. Who can run a business at less profit?”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon continues to expand. Last year, the retailer announced it was building a million-square-foot warehouse in Patterson, Calif., about 85 miles southeast of San Francisco. Last week, it announced another million-square-foot warehouse barely 30 miles north of Patterson, in Tracy. It obviously has designs on fast (if not quite same-day) shipping to the seven million generally affluent, Internet-using residents of the Bay Area.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We’ll continue to expand our footprint over time and become even closer and closer to customers,” Mr. Szkutak said on the conference call.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many of those shoppers will be buying material that originated not with Amazon but with more than two million third-party sellers. The volume of items sold by these firms during the 2012 holidays was up 40 percent from 2011. Some of these sellers merely used Amazon to digitally display their goods, while others also used the retailer to ship it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon said earlier this month that third-party sellers sold enough Santa hats during the holiday for Santa to wear a new hat every day for the next 127 years, and enough guitar picks to give one to every attendee of Woodstock — about a half-million. Analysts expect third-party sales to outpace Amazon deals over the next few years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recently several states, including California, successfully made deals with Amazon to collect sales tax. That had the effect of raising prices on many Amazon items by more than 5 percent. Land-based retailers, which had agitated for years for such a move, thought the tax might finally level the playing field.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Their hopes might be misplaced. Any drop in online sales from the collecting of sales tax tends to be temporary, said Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, which helps retailers sell online, including on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020130129e91u003s6</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_056.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark106">Media Decoder</a><a name="bookmark107">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business; Media &amp; Advertising</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">YouTube Expected to Experiment With Paid Subscriptions for Some Channels</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By BRIAN STELTER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">452 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30 January 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MIAMI -- YouTube continues to inch toward a paid subscription option for some of the professionally produced channels, employees of the online video Web site said this week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/youtube-set-introduce-paid-subscriptions-spring/239437/" class="s1" target="_blank">&quot;It&#39;s a good time to start experimenting,&quot; Jamie Byrne, the director of content strategy for YouTube, said at a television conference here on Monday. Mr. Byrne didn&#39;t elaborate on the timing, but </a><a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/youtube-set-introduce-paid-subscriptions-spring/239437/" class="a" target="_blank">Advertising Age reported on</a><a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/youtube-set-introduce-paid-subscriptions-spring/239437/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/youtube-set-introduce-paid-subscriptions-spring/239437/" class="a" target="_blank">Tuesday</a><a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/youtube-set-introduce-paid-subscriptions-spring/239437/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/youtube-set-introduce-paid-subscriptions-spring/239437/" class="s1" target="_blank">that paid channels could be introduced as early as April.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Byrne&#39;s use of the word &quot;experiment&quot; is important. YouTube is primarily an advertising-driven service, and no one expects that to change. But some of the companies that produce popular videos for YouTube would like to try charging a modest monthly fee for access to their channels. Ad Age said the subscription option would be tried first with a small group of channels, &quot;likely about 25 at the outset.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There&#39;s been talk about YouTube creating a paid subscription option for more than a year, and it has gained momentum as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon have drawn in subscribers for their video offerings. A YouTube spokesman declined to comment on the report about a possible April introduction, but said: &quot;We have long maintained that different content requires different types of payment models. The important thing is that, regardless of the model, our creators succeed on the platform. There are a lot of our content creators that think they would benefit from subscriptions, so we&#39;re looking at that.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the conference here, Mr. Byrne suggested two ways YouTube could go about charging for content. Video creators, he said, could have standalone paid channels &quot;and be accountable for all the content there,&quot; much like Glenn Beck&#39;s subscription service The Blaze. Or, he said, YouTube could create bundles of subscription channels, charge one price for all of them and share the revenue with the channel creators, much like traditional cable and satellite services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He was careful to add, though, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t count the ad model out.&quot;</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/business/media/youtube-to-serve-niche-tastes-by-adding-channels.html" class="s1" target="_blank">The interest in paid subscriptions comes as YouTube continues to </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/business/media/youtube-to-serve-niche-tastes-by-adding-channels.html" class="a" target="_blank">invests heavily in original programming.</a> <span style=" color: #000;">Last fall its parent, Google, announced a plan to invest $200 million to market the new channels on the service.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;These channels, we think of them as the next wave of potential networks,&quot; Mr. Byrne said. &quot;We think it&#39;s going great.&quot;</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/karmazin-leaves-sirius-xm-earlier-than-expected/" class="a" target="_blank">Karmazin Leaves Sirius XM Earlier Than </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/karmazin-leaves-sirius-xm-earlier-than-expected/" target="_blank">Expected</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/streaming-and-micropennies-the-footnotes/" class="a" target="_blank">Streaming and Micropennies: The </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/streaming-and-micropennies-the-footnotes/" target="_blank">Footnotes</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/digital-notes-amazon-enters-apples-phones-to-compete-on-music-downloads/" class="a" target="_blank">Digital Notes: Amazon Enters Apple&#39;s Phones to Compete on Music </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/digital-notes-amazon-enters-apples-phones-to-compete-on-music-downloads/" target="_blank">Downloads</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/the-breakfast-meeting-a-digital-kingdom-and-the-future-of-tvs/" class="a" target="_blank">The Breakfast Meeting: A Digital Kingdom and the Future of </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/the-breakfast-meeting-a-digital-kingdom-and-the-future-of-tvs/" target="_blank">TVs</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/herding-cats-for-hollywood/" class="a" target="_blank">Herding Cats for </a><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/herding-cats-for-hollywood/" target="_blank">Hollywood</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020130130e91u0033c</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_057.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark108">Gadgetwise</a><a name="bookmark109">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Technology; Personal Tech</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Q&amp;A: Reading Google Books on an iPhone</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By J.D.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Randall Sullivan published his biography of Michael Jackson in November, he said he thought the singer was innocent of child molesting but he could not be absolutely positive. He said that after surgeries and more surgeries, little was left of Mr. Jackson&#39;s nose besides his nostrils. He argued that despite two marriages, Mr. Jackson was probably a virgin when he died.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">None of this went over well with Mr. Jackson&#39;s fans, who voiced their displeasure with attacks on &quot;Untouchable: The Strange Life and Tragic Death of Michael Jackson&quot; and its author, a longtime contributor to Rolling Stone. Their primary weapon: one-star reviews on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since my article about their campaign appeared in The New York Times on Monday, dozens of people who were apparently outraged by what they saw the fans doing went to Amazon and wrote five-star reviews as a sort of riposte. There are now 142 five-star reviews, up from two dozen a few weeks ago, and 132 one-star reviews, up from about 100.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the battle is merely joined. After the article appeared, Michael Jackson&#39;s Rapid Response Team to Media Attacks asked via Twitter that people continue to post comments on Amazon. Many of the newly posted positive reviews have critical comments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The positive reviews are no more believable in their praise than the negative reviews were in their criticism. By this point, the truth about the value of &quot;Untouchable&quot; - not to mention the truth about Mr. Jackson&#39;s virginity and nose - is buried underneath all these competing claims, which must count as a victory for the book&#39;s opponents. As a result, don&#39;t be surprised if &quot;star bombing,&quot; as it&#39;s been called, keeps on happening.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has tried to make reviewers more accountable by adding several tools where people can evaluate reviews. But this incident proved that those tools are open to their own manipulation. Take, for instance, an excerpt from this review: &quot;Randall Sullivan is fake, my uncle best friend use to work for the Rolling Stones company and known Randy and the jacksons for years, He use people and lie to them to get ahead and he is not born again.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is not a review, that is semi-coherent slander. But Amazon, which said it reviewed all the reviews of &quot;Untouchable,&quot; did not see anything wrong with it, and 53 Jackson fans voted it a &quot;helpful&quot; review, which in theory pushed it to a more prominent position on the page. Apply those votes to dozens of critical reviews and it&#39;s relatively simple for a handful of people to create an apparently massive surge of disapproval.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

They bombarded Amazon with dozens of one-star takedowns, succeeded in getting several favorable notices erased and even took credit for Amazon’s briefly removing the book from sale.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Books used to die by being ignored, but now they can be killed — and perhaps unjustly killed,” said Trevor Pinch, a Cornell sociologist who has studied Amazon reviews. “In theory, a very good book could be killed by a group of people for malicious reasons.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In “Untouchable: The Strange Life and Tragic Death of Michael Jackson,” Randall Sullivan writes that Jackson’s overuse of plastic surgery reduced his nose to little more than a pair of nostrils and that he died a virgin despite being married twice. These points in particular seem to infuriate the fans.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/books/untouchable-michael-jacksons-life-by-randall-sullivan.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" class="s1" target="_blank">Outside Amazon, the book had a mixed reception; in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/books/untouchable-michael-jacksons-life-by-randall-sullivan.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" class="a" target="_blank">called it</a> <span style=" color: #000;">“thoroughly dispensable.” So it is difficult to pinpoint how effective the campaign was. Still, the book has been a resounding failure in the marketplace.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fans, who call themselves Michael Jackson’s Rapid Response Team to Media Attacks, say they are exercising their free speech rights to protest a book they feel is exploitative and inaccurate. “Sullivan does everything he can to dehumanize, dismantle and destroy, against all objective fact,” a spokesman for the group said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the book’s publisher, Grove Press, said the Amazon review system was being abused in an organized campaign. “We’re very reluctant to interfere with the free flow of discourse, but there should be transparency about people’s motivations,” said Morgan Entrekin, president of Grove/Atlantic, Grove’s parent company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon said the fans’ reviews had not violated its guidelines but declined further comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retailer, like other sites that depend on customer reviews, has been faced with the problem of so-called sock puppets, those people secretly commissioned by an author to produce favorable notices. In recent months, Amazon has made efforts to remove reviews by those it deemed too close to the author, especially relatives.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The issue of attack reviews, though, has received little attention. The historian Orlando Figes was revealed in 2010 to be using Amazon to anonymously vilify his rivals and secretly praise himself. The crime writer R. J. Ellory was exposed for doing the same thing last fall.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Attack reviews are hard to police. It is difficult, if not impossible, to detect the difference between an authentic critical review and an author malevolently trying to bring down a colleague, or organized assaults by fans.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s extensive rules on reviewing offer little guidance on what is permissible in negative reviews and what is not.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With “Untouchable,” Grove had hopes for a modest best seller. The book was excerpted in Vanity Fair, and Mr. Sullivan, a longtime contributor to Rolling Stone who lives in Portland, Ore., promoted it on “Nightline” and “Good Morning America.” Amazon selected it as one of the best books of November, encouraging readers to “check out this train wreck of a life.” The retailer also selected it as one of the 100 best e-books of the year.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">None of that helped when Mr. Sullivan tried to complain, saying reviews of his book were factually false yet being voted up by the fans so that they dominated the page for “Untouchable.” The bookseller replied with boilerplate. “Rest assured, we’ll read each of the reviews and remove any that violate our guidelines,” adding, “We’ve appreciated your business and hope to have the opportunity to serve you again in the future.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In an interview, Mr. Sullivan asked: “Should people be allowed to make flagrantly false comments about the content of a book or its author? This is suppression of free speech in the name of free speech.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Untouchable” is 586 pages of text, with 200 pages of notes. Much of it focuses on Jackson’s chaotic last years, including his efforts at comebacks, his struggles to remain solvent, his shocking death in 2009 and the battle over his estate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is a largely sympathetic portrait. For instance, Mr. Sullivan seeks to refute the popular notion that the singer had troubling relationships with young boys. Jackson was found not guilty of child-molesting in a criminal trial in 2005.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet even before the book was officially published on Nov. 13, the rapid response team declared, “It’s time for action!”</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Untouchable-Strange-Tragic-Michael-Jackson/dp/080211962X/ref%3Dsr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357937795&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Jackson%2BUntouchable" class="s1" target="_blank">Within two weeks, the book had </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Untouchable-Strange-Tragic-Michael-Jackson/dp/080211962X/ref%3Dsr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357937795&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Jackson%2BUntouchable" class="a" target="_blank">nearly 100 anonymous one-star reviews</a> <span style=" color: #000;">that included such comments as: “A disgrace and a disgusting insult to the greatest artist and entertainer the world has ever known.” “There is not one actual fact in this book.” “Sullivan seeks to criticize Michael’s spending habits? It’s none of his business what Michael spent his money on.” “Michael Jackson has dedicated his entire life to helping others. He doesn’t deserve this.” “The audacity to term Michael Jackson’s life a ‘train wreck’ is nothing less than evil and uneducated.”</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/books/index.ssf/2012/12/bookmarks_angry_jackson_fans_a.html" class="s1" target="_blank">For several days in late November, Amazon stopped selling physical copies of the book after buyers said copies were defective, in a development first reported by </a>The Portland Oregonian<span class="p">. Mr. Entrekin said Amazon was the only sales outlet that had received such complaints.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fans took the credit for removing the book from sale. “Book stopped selling,” one of them noted in a Nov. 26 post on the Facebook page. “MJ fans we have done it again!!! Who’s BAD!!!”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">About that time, other readers started leaving positive reviews of the book and criticizing the negative reviews, turning the review forum into a full-scale brawl. The fans labeled these reviewers “haters,” saying: “Do not fight with the haters but we need you to focus on the book and leave negative reviews of the book. Rate it with one star. We do not want the book rating to go up.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It also encouraged the fans to report “the MJ hating trolls” to Amazon for making “inappropriate and personal” attacks against those who left negative reviews.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPBxohzPm-8" class="s1" target="_blank">Tom Mesereau, the Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer who became a hero among Jackson fans when he successfully represented the singer in his molesting case, was a major source for Mr. Sullivan. In early December, he made </a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPBxohzPm-8" class="a" target="_blank">a YouTube video</a> <span style=" color: #000;">calling the attacks on “Untouchable” a “disgusting, sophisticated, Hollywood-style P.R. campaign.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In reality, the campaign is being run a long way from Hollywood. An administrator for the rapid response team, who identified himself as Steve Pollard, said five people run the Facebook site and Twitter efforts, only three of them in the United States. Going after “Untouchable” was “a moral responsibility,” said Mr. Pollard, a 52-year-old resident of Detroit. He explained, “If you were to drive by a graveyard and see someone steal a corpse in order to make a profit, you would feel some responsibility to do something.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said that the response team did not tell fans what to say in their Amazon reviews and that they did not try to have the book removed, despite messages to the contrary on the Facebook page. But he added in an e-mail that some of the favorable reviews of “Untouchable” “were removed (I think) because they were attacks against fans and not reviews of his book. We reported the attacks of course.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Pinch, the Cornell researcher, said he got the sense that “Amazon is hoping that all these problems with positive and negative reviews will go away.” He added: “But as more and more abuses come to light, the overall effect will be a slow undermining of the process. There are so many ways to game the system.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Grove distributed 16,000 copies of “Untouchable.” Nielsen BookScan, which tracks sales in most outlets, counted only 3,000 copies sold. For a time this month, “Untouchable” was being outsold on Amazon by a book on Jackson’s body language, “Behind the Mask.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That book, published by the author, had something going for it that “Untouchable” did not: the endorsement of the fans. “Michael Jackson would be pleased that such an objective book was written about him,” one reviewer wrote on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document NYTFEED020130120e91l002bd</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_060.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark114">Media Decoder</a><a name="bookmark115">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business; Media &amp; Advertising</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Digital Notes: Amazon Enters Apple&#39;s Phones to Compete on Music Downloads</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By BEN SISARIO</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">662 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">17 January 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

Performing rights societies like Ascap and BMI usually negotiate rates on behalf of publishers, but at the beginning of this year Sony withdrew its digital rights from these groups, forcing licensees like Pandora to deal with Sony directly. (The rights societies still represent Sony when it comes to radio, television and other kinds of performances.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The deal could lead to higher rates for other publishers. It could also lead to slightly thinner margins for Pandora, which pays more than half its revenue in royalties, although the vast majority of those royalty payments go to record companies and performing artists.

Amazon bought its 1.8-million-square-foot headquarters last month from Vulcan Real Estate for $1.16 billion, the biggest office sale nationwide and a bold departure for a company that had been content to rent space until last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And it’s not done yet. Although Amazon leases or owns 2.7 million square feet of space in Seattle, the online retailer plans to more than double that figure when it breaks ground on three office towers of its own on the northern fringe of downtown this year. Amazon did not return calls seeking comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s flurry of activity has led to rent increases and a drop in office vacancy and has inspired confidence in the market. Other companies, largely led by technology firms, have shaved the vacancy rate to 10.7 percent at the end of last year, from 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Kidder Mathews, a commercial real estate brokerage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The biggest vacancy decrease has been in South Lake Union, an area north of downtown where Amazon’s stake in the neighborhood has drawn other companies looking for large floorplates and new buildings. In the last three years, about half of Seattle’s net absorption, or the amount of space companies leased and occupied, was in South Lake Union, where the vacancy rate fell to 5.4 percent from 9.3 percent, according to CBRE, a commercial real estate brokerage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We’re seeing a lot of companies that want to be closer to Amazon and that synergy, whether they do business with Amazon or not,” said Jesse Ottele, a senior vice president at CBRE in Seattle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A tighter office market has pushed up rents across the city. The average rent rose to $29.19 a square foot at the end of last year, from $27.80 in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Kidder Mathews. With few large blocks of Class A office space available and little new space expected to reach the market soon, brokers expect rents to go even higher this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Developers are now talking about building again — even without a tenant. Eight million square feet of office space are in the works across the city, with more than half planned or under construction in South Lake Union, according to CBRE. Residential developers will also open 5,800 units this year, the most in decades, according to Dupre &amp; Scott Apartment Advisors, a research firm.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vulcan Real Estate is betting more companies will want to move to South Lake Union. Although the developer, which owns 30 percent of the land there, has built more than five million square feet of space in the last decade, it has up to seven million square feet of space left that it can build. This year, Vulcan is breaking ground on two office buildings leased to Amazon and a life-sciences research building. If the City Council raises height limits in the neighborhood this spring, Vulcan may move ahead with plans for two more office buildings and three 24-story residential towers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We’re now looking to position ourselves for a recovering economy and teeing up speculative buildings,” said Ada Healey, a vice president at Vulcan Real Estate. “We want to be in a situation to take advantage of 2013.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other developers are also moving ahead in anticipation of the height rezoning. After purchasing blocks in South Lake Union in the last year and a half, Touchstone and Skanska, a Swedish development and construction company, submitted permits for three office buildings, for a total of 1.1 million square feet, that would exceed current limits. Company executives said they would consider building without a signed tenant.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Sometime around mid-2012, we saw rents for Class A office that justified new construction,” said Lisa Picard, executive vice president of Skanska USA Commercial Development in Seattle. “The project is ready to start. We’ll look at the supply and demand of the market and decide whether to go.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seattle appears to be at the top of many investors’ shopping lists. The Urban Land Institute ranked the city as fourth-best in the country for office buildings thanks to its projected job growth of 1.2 percent and its roster of expanding brand-name companies like Starbucks, Nordstrom and Boeing. Real estate investors, who are looking for steady returns, have flocked to Seattle for its stable and growing companies.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/southern-california/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" class="s1" target="_blank">“The capital followed the fundamentals,” said Kevin Shannon, CBRE’s vice chairman in </a>Los Angeles<span class="p">. “Seattle and San Francisco were the two stars in West Coast markets. A couple of years ago, I’m not sure Seattle would be on a core shopping list. We now have a lot of people looking at Seattle.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The city’s investment market cemented its revival last year. The volume of deals skyrocketed 203 percent in 2012 over the previous year, to $5 billion, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research and consulting firm. Among the 14.5 million square feet sold, Amazon’s headquarters space is the largest.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The sale of the Russell Investments Center building early last year, though, was perhaps the most significant of the year because it showed the city’s investment market had fully recovered. When the 42-story office tower was put up for sale in late 2011, it attracted 34 buyer tours, an “incredible” number, said Mr. Shannon of CBRE, which handled the sale. It sold last spring for $480 million — more than four times its purchase price in 2009.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After its bid for the Russell building lost, Clarion Partners, an investment management company, looked for other buildings with the same “blue chip roster” and reliable rents, which it found at 1201 Third Avenue, the city’s second-tallest tower and a former headquarters of the failed Washington Mutual. Clarion advised on a deal to sell the 55-story tower for $548.8 million, the 10th-largest deal in the country last year, to a joint venture of MetLife and an unidentified institutional real estate investor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We expect it to continue to have blue chip tenancy and generate good, predictable cash flow,” said Steve Latimer, a managing director at Clarion Partners. “We’re not expecting spectacular headlines of tripling our money in three years, just steady growth.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Seattle’s brisk sales pace may slow this year since so many office buildings have traded hands and there are few left.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Were there other first-class properties, we’d be interested,” said Mr. Latimer, Clarion’s Seattle director. “Seattle is clearly a market that will continue to grow.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document NYTFEED020130116e91g000gu</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_062.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark118">SQUARE FEET</a><a name="bookmark119">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Drives Seattle Office Market Surge</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By KRISTINA SHEVORY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,190 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16 January 2013 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

Amazon bought its 1.8-million-square-foot headquarters last month from Vulcan Real Estate for $1.16 billion, the biggest office sale nationwide and a bold departure for a company that had been content to rent space until last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And it&#39;s not done yet. Although Amazon leases or owns 2.7 million square feet of space in Seattle, the online retailer plans to more than double that figure when it breaks ground on three office towers of its own on the northern fringe of downtown this year.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In literature and philosophy, in both West and East, the notion of search refers to expansive, ambitious human pursuits. We have, alternately, searched for the Promised Land and the holy grail. Astronomers have searched for life in outer space. The Buddha searched for truth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But search on the Internet has shifted in recent years. Search is now what the Web companies call &quot;personalized,&quot; or in Facebook-speak, &quot;social.&quot; This new kind of search is designed to make more money for industry by helping them target advertising. The companies say it can be useful for consumers, and it well may be in certain circumstances. It also threatens to narrow our horizons.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/google-adds-posts-from-its-social-network-to-search-results/" class="s1" target="_blank">For Google, personalized search tracks what we search for and write in our e-mail communications, and so seeks to know us so well that its robots can predict what we want to know. As my colleague Claire Cain Miller has </a>pointed out<span class="p">, search for &quot;Sonoma wineries&quot; and Google may show a forgotten but relevant e-mail conversation from your in-box. Its algorithms can mine, in addition to links from around the Web, what your friends on Google+ have said about Sonoma wineries.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That doesn&#39;t mean you cannot ditch your friends&#39; recommendations of course, nor that you cannot talk to the woman at the wine shop to recommend something to pair with mussels. But it makes serendipity that much more difficult to achieve. It diminishes discovery.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Twitter&#39;s &quot;discovery&quot; tab predicts what you wish to read. Yelp shows you the taquerias and dry cleaners your friends favor - followed by the recommendations of strangers. Amazon.com serves up things you might like to buy &quot;based on your browsing history.&quot;</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/facebook-unveils-a-new-search-tool/?ref=business" class="s1" target="_blank">Facebook this week </a>stepped into the search game<span class="p">, as expected. It will deploy the data that we have laid at its doorstep. Ask a question and Facebook&#39;s robots will crawl through your friends&#39; posts to ferret out an answer. Theoretically, these answers will shape the music you listen to, the books you read - perhaps one day, which gods you worship.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the era of social search, how luxurious it is to squirrel away in a library and browse the poetry aisles. How thrilling to walk through a city, unknown and undisturbed, and venture into a restaurant to taste something new and odd. Webster&#39;s says the word &quot;search&quot; came from the Latin word, &quot;circare,&quot; to go about. It is defined principally as &quot;to look into or over carefully or thoroughly in an effort to find out or discover something.&quot;</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/facebook-unveils-a-new-search-tool/" class="a" target="_blank">Facebook Unveils a New Search </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/facebook-unveils-a-new-search-tool/" target="_blank">Tool</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/daily-report-revamping-bing-for-search-engine-supremacy/" class="a" target="_blank">Daily Report: Revamping Bing for Search Engine </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/daily-report-revamping-bing-for-search-engine-supremacy/" target="_blank">Supremacy</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/microsoft-and-facebook-align-further-with-patent-deal/" class="a" target="_blank">Microsoft and Facebook Align Further With Patent </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/microsoft-and-facebook-align-further-with-patent-deal/" target="_blank">Deal</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/what-were-reading-what-youre-reading/" class="a" target="_blank">What We&#39;re Reading: What You&#39;re </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/what-were-reading-what-youre-reading/" target="_blank">Reading</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">A Search Engine That Relies on Humans<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020130116e91g002ut</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_064.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark122">Gadgetwise</a><a name="bookmark123">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Technology; Personal Tech</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Q&amp;A: Resetting a Kindle&#39;s Automatic Bookmark</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By J.D.

The reality is no less acute for Amazon as it searches for ways to avoid another widespread outage of its public cloud business, Amazon Web Services.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We ask ourselves the question all the time,&quot; said Adam Selipsky, vice president at A.W.S. &quot;There is a list of things you don&#39;t know about.&quot;</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/message/680587/" class="s1" target="_blank">On Dec. 29, Amazon Web Services </a><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/message/680587/" class="a" target="_blank">published</a> <span style=" color: #000;">a detailed explanation of what went wrong Christmas Eve, when Netflix and many other customers (Amazon won&#39;t say how many) had service disruptions. The company also described what it was doing to ensure the problem would not happen again.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The short version: An A.W.S. developer inadvertently took out part of the software that makes sure data loads are properly distributed across the computers in a computer center in Virginia. New activity on the site was slowed or failed altogether. Netflix was unable to supply streaming movies. Service was not fully restored for almost 12 hours.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What Amazon didn&#39;t go into is how much it is trying to figure out what else might go wrong in an increasingly complex system. Part of that effort consists of publishing explanations (this one was notably full of information), and part consists, as in warfare, of lots more scenario planning.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A.W.S. tries to figure out how its complex global network of perhaps a half-million servers could break by having one team look at the work of another, by bringing in top engineers from elsewhere in Amazon and, occasionally, by hiring outside experts in performance and security.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Running I.T. infrastructure in a highly reliable and cost-effective fashion is hard,&quot; Mr. Selipsky said. &quot;We&#39;re able to put more resources on that than the vast majority of our customers can. That said, there is no substitute for experience.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is also a deep technical lesson in the recent outage. Mostly engineers look at code for flaws, but the operational breakdown at A.W.S. on Dec. 24 seems to have been a result of human organizational error, not the software itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the future, developers will need specific permission to change the data load balancing equipment. What isn&#39;t clear is whether A.W.S. can examine all of its own management practices to see if there are other such decision-making flaws.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Selipsky, understandably, could not say whether everything else was solid, though he did note that Amazon had eight years of experience running and managing big systems for others.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To be sure, such breakdowns happen all the time with old-style corporate servers. While they don&#39;t have the dramatic effect of an A.W.S. failure, they may collectively represent much more downtime.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/552208-idc-report-on-amazon-web-services.html" class="a" target="_blank">In a study</a> <span style=" color: #000;">commissioned by Amazon, IDC said downtime on A.W.S. was 72 percent less per year than on conventional corporate servers. While the financing of the study makes its conclusions somewhat questionable, its results are in line with similar studies about online e-mail systems compared with in-house products.</span></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/amazon-cloud-service-goes-down-and-takes-some-popular-web-sites-with-it/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Cloud Service Goes Down and Takes Popular Sites With </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/amazon-cloud-service-goes-down-and-takes-some-popular-web-sites-with-it/" target="_blank">It</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/amazons-a-w-s-job-openings-reveal-its-future/" class="a" target="_blank">Job Openings at Amazon Web Services Reveal Its </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/amazons-a-w-s-job-openings-reveal-its-future/" target="_blank">Future</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/amazon-reshapes-business-with-cloud-service/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Reshapes Business Computing With Cloud </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/amazon-reshapes-business-with-cloud-service/" target="_blank">Service</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/how-to-run-your-not-small-company-off-a-laptop/" class="a" target="_blank">How to Run Your (Not Small) Company Off of a </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/how-to-run-your-not-small-company-off-a-laptop/" target="_blank">Laptop</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon Creates a Software Rental Store<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020130108e918004xu</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_067.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark128">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark129">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Publishing Without Perishing</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,557 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 January 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

Mr. Morrison answered some questions by email. What follows is an edited extract.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. Will the ultimate pleasure for lovers of the printed book be your own editions of your favorite out-of-copyright books?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. For me it was a matter of there being books in the public domain that I wanted to read which were either not available as physical books, or were available only in staggeringly ugly and expensive editions. I originally intended to just design a cover I liked and then print a copy for myself to read, but it turned out to be an almost negligible amount of extra effort to make them available for others to buy as well, so I thought I might as well do so. It would be as easy to produce editions of things like &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; or &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; but there are already hundreds of versions of those, some with fantastic cover designs, so it would be a bit pointless.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. How easy would it be for others to become a publisher the way you did?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A. It&#39;s very easy indeed, assuming you have some basic layout or design skills. Even without those you could still do it, though the book would probably not be so appealing. I&#39;d certainly recommend it for people who, unsatisfied with the available editions, wanted a book they enjoyed having around the house. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it as a</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">way of making money. I&#39;ve spent slightly more on proof copies, etc., than I&#39;ve earned through royalties. Partly this is because I try to set the book prices as low as possible (I make about $1 a book through Amazon, and a little more if someone buys the books direct from Lulu), since they&#39;re: a) books usually available free or cheaply in electronic form, and b) Print on Demand books, which are not quite as nice to hold and handle as conventionally published books, so it seems unfair to charge more for them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. I was struck by how little capital you needed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Lulu and Amazon take a cut of each copy sold but require no up-front listing fees or anything like that. The only money I spend is on ordering proof copies for myself, which is the production cost without anything else added on</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- about $8 for one recent title. To make a book available on Amazon, you need to order at least one physical copy yourself, check it, and then let Lulu know it&#39;s OK to go ahead and list it. If you just wanted to list on Lulu&#39;s own site, you don&#39;t even need to do that -- you could upload a thousand different books and make them available for sale via the Lulu site without ever spending a cent (though you&#39;d never know what they looked like as physical books, of course).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. How have the books done?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Not vast numbers. The most popular has sold 27 copies. That, a little surprisingly, is A. P. Herbert&#39;s &quot;The Secret Battle&quot;: it&#39;s a very good novel by a once-popular and now nearly forgotten English writer, based on his World War I experiences, and about the way the English army would execute its own men for cowardice. Close behind are &quot;Transfiguration,&quot; a pair of novellas and some nonfiction by the great Austrian writer and suicide Stefan Zweig, and &quot;The Dangerous Age,&quot; a classic feminist Danish novella by Karin MichaÎlis. But then there are some which have done surprisingly poorly. F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s play &quot;The Vegetable,&quot; the only edition currently in print, has sold only two copies. But then I can&#39;t sell that in the U.S., where it&#39;s still in copyright, and that&#39;s probably where the main market for a parody on Warren Harding&#39;s presidency is likely to be found. Thinking over that sentence, maybe it&#39;s a surprise I&#39;ve sold any copies at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. Who sets the prices?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. The pricing is under my control, to a point. Basically, Lulu tells you the absolute minimum you can charge, which covers the production costs and their profit, and then you add to that whatever you want. For example, the Stefan Zweig production cost is $8.10 and then Lulu add a little to that to create the absolute lowest price, which is the lowest I could charge and still make them a little profit (they take 20 percent of any profit on physical books, or 10 percent for ebooks) -- in this case around $9. I sell it for $11.95, from which Amazon then takes a little over</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$3 (some of this may also go to Lulu or some other third party -- Amazon doesn&#39;t disclose that), and I get 69 cents. If someone decided to buy the book from Lulu, which is less likely since they have to pay for postage and so on, I make $3.08 (and Lulu gets 77 cents); however, almost every sale comes via Amazon. But I could set the price at anything above that base cost of $8.10, like $25 or even $250, if I thought anyone was mad enough to pay it, and most of that inflated cost would come to me.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. How much have you invested in this overall and how much has it brought you?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. I&#39;ve only earned a few hundred dollars over two years, and have probably spent about $200 to do that, so I&#39;m slightly ahead, but it&#39;s no way to make a living. Partly this is my own fault - I have no interest in marketing or networking, so I just publish the books and let them do their thing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. Are others doing this?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. To my surprise, I don&#39;t know of anyone doing things in quite the same way as I am. Most publishers of Print on Demand classics seem to operate on a different scale: they make thousands of titles available, usually with identical covers and at eye-watering prices, or else they just sell them as ebooks. I suspect it&#39;s a matter of poor timing, technologically: the ability to print a whole physical book cheaply but at a decent quality has become available to everyone just at the same time as ebooks have started wreaking havoc with the market. It&#39;s a niche thing, I suspect, but I&#39;m happy enough in that niche.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. I think this is just beginning. I envision a future where we will all have competing Stefan Zweig lines.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. I hope this is the way it pans out.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/fired-up-about-the-kindle-fire/" class="a" target="_blank">Fired Up About the Kindle </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/fired-up-about-the-kindle-fire/" target="_blank">Fire</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/amazons-diminishing-discounts/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon&#39;s Diminishing </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/amazons-diminishing-discounts/" target="_blank">Discounts</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/tim-ferriss-and-amazon-try-to-reinvent-publishing/" class="a" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss and Amazon Try to Reinvent </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/tim-ferriss-and-amazon-try-to-reinvent-publishing/" target="_blank">Publishing</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/disruptions-twitters-faster-gantlet-of-truth/" class="a" target="_blank">Disruptions: Twitter&#39;s Uneasy Role in Guarding the </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/disruptions-twitters-faster-gantlet-of-truth/" target="_blank">Truth</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon Cloud Service Goes Down and Takes Popular Sites With It<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020130101e9110025t</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_068.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark130">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</a><a name="bookmark131">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Popular Demand</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By SHELLY FREIERMAN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">149 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">31 December 2012 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 6</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.

Visits to retail Web sites increased on Thanksgiving (6 percent) and on the following Monday (11 percent), but not as much as on Christmas Day, when visits were up 27 percent over last year. Perhaps people were still shopping, or were redeeming gift cards. Searches for iTunes and Amazon&#39;s Kindle drove visits to Apple and Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some were checking movie theaters, to see films like &#39;&#39;Les Miserables,&#39;&#39; above, which opened on Christmas Day, with Isabelle Allen and Hugh Jackman.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ivy Wu did not immediately need the navy lace cocktail dress she ordered the other day. But when a representative from Shoptiques, an e-commerce site, arrived at her Midtown Manhattan office with the dress only hours after Ms. Wu, 26, had placed her order, &#39;&#39;I was really impressed that it was here,&#39;&#39; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This holiday season, same-day shipping has replaced free shipping as the new must-have promotion. It&#39;s logistically complicated and money-losing -- and may not even be a service that consumers want or need, analysts say. But retailers from Walmart to small shops like Shoptiques are willing to take the risk. Even the Postal Service has introduced a same-day option for retailers. And the reason is simple: fear of Amazon.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, the world&#39;s biggest online retailer, has hinted that it will expand its same-day shipping service, giving customers the immediate gratification that has been the biggest advantage of brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For small outfits like Shoptiques, it is not an easy proposition. The courier who showed up at Ms. Wu&#39;s office was the company&#39;s head of boutique operations, who has put aside her regular job this holiday season to make deliveries by hand. Bigger retailers, like Toys &#39;&#39;R&#39;&#39; Us, Macy&#39;s and Target, have worked with eBay to deliver items the same day, as have other old-line stores. Google has begun testing a local delivery service with several chains.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;There&#39;s lots going on in this space, and it&#39;s all driven by Amazon,&#39;&#39; said Tom Allason, founder and chief executive of Shutl, a British same-day delivery service that will expand to the United States next year. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s not really being driven by consumers at the moment.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The same-day delivery idea was a spectacular failure during the dot.com boom. Companies like Kozmo.com and Webvan went under because the services simply cost too much to be profitable. Amazon has offered same-day shipping since 2009, but with limits -- only in big cities near Amazon warehouses on certain items ordered in the morning.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The geographical limits exist because Amazon had built warehouses far from major cities to avoid charging sales tax in certain states. But it has now given in on the sales tax fight, and in return, is erecting warehouses near cities like San Francisco, which analysts say is paving the way for faster, more widespread same-day delivery and spurring competitors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It&#39;s the old idiom, &#39;time is money,&#39; &#39;&#39; said Lina Shustarovich, an eBay spokeswoman. &#39;&#39;How much time are you saving by not going to the store? People want it now, they want it fast.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart, which is the nation&#39;s biggest retailer but sells just a fraction of what Amazon does online, is testing same-day shipping during the holiday season in five markets. Generally, it gives shoppers a four-hour delivery window and charges $10 for same- or next-day delivery. The idea is &#39;&#39;to give customers convenience, by way of combining our online shopping with the local presence of stores,&#39;&#39; said Amy Lester, a Walmart spokeswoman for global commerce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But, Ms. Lester said, the test is showing that consumers often pick next-day delivery rather than same day. She declined to give a specific figure for same-day orders, but said thousands of same- and next-day orders had been placed.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Net-a-Porter, the designer apparel e-commerce site, said its same-day service is quite popular. Its $25 delivery service in the London and New York areas pays for itself, said Alison Loehnis, its managing director. But its clients are accustomed to paying for concierge service, like the customer who ordered clothing to be delivered the same day to her private jet before a vacation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With the eBay Now iPhone app, introduced this year in San Francisco and New York, customers choose items from physical stores and eBay sends a courier to the store to pick it up and drop it off -- at an apartment, office, coffee shop or bar -- for a $5 fee.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EBay declined to say whether it loses money on the orders, but analysts who study logistics say it is not profitable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;The goal with this pilot was never to monetize,&#39;&#39; Ms. Shustarovich said. But in the future, it could make money, she said, for example if retailers pay eBay a fee for bringing them customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Postal Service is testing a same-day service in San Francisco that is meant to offset its declining carrier business, a spokesman said. Consumers can order items until 2 p.m. from 1-800-Flowers.com, the first retailer offering the service, and a Postal Service employee will pick up the package and deliver it between 4 and 8 p.m.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smaller companies are trying different approaches.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">TaskRabbit, which offers à la carte personal assistant services, noticed last summer that delivering items from local stores was the most popular task requested.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, it charges $10 for delivery from local stores, starting in San Francisco.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Today&#39;s technology -- including mobile phones, social networking and location-based mapping services -- has forever transformed shoppers&#39; expectations, said Johnny Brackett, a TaskRabbit spokesman.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;People have become accustomed to this idea of instant gratification, where you just type something on your phone and the next thing you know, you have what you need,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yossi Sheffi, director of the M.I.T. Center for Transportation and Logistics, said he was &#39;&#39;skeptical&#39;&#39; about</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">same-day working well. Efficient, high volume same-day delivery -- with warehouses that use robots and trucks filled with items -- costs $10 an order, he estimated, while one-off deliveries could cost up to $50 each.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s &#39;&#39;outrageously expensive,&#39;&#39; he said. Not to mention complicated.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shoptiques, which sells apparel from offline boutiques, already offered free returns and free shipping over $100, but Olga Vidisheva, its founder and chief executive, decided to offer same-day shipping during the holidays in New York to compete with larger retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">She could not afford an outside delivery service, though, so on a recent winter day, the task was left to Arianna Simpson, director of boutique operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ms. Simpson had spent the morning dashing between downtown boutiques to pick up orders. Now, carrying a large blue Ikea bag full of Shoptiques parcels, she hurried past a costumed Puss in Boots and talked her way past a front-desk attendant in Midtown Manhattan.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After two hours, two subway rides and 3.2 miles on foot, Ms. Simpson had successfully delivered four packages. With Manhattan dark and commuters rushing toward the Herald Square subway, Ms. Simpson went back uptown for a pickup, took two trains to Bushwick in Brooklyn for a drop-off and went to SoHo for a final delivery.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite all that effort, Ms. Vidisheva said, though people appreciate the service, it is not exactly essential.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Some people would rather get it in the mail,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;You say, &#39;I&#39;ll deliver it the same day,&#39; and they say, &#39;Listen, there&#39;s no rush.&#39; &#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Mr. Allason said that would change quickly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;People don&#39;t need immediate delivery today, but they will need it tomorrow, because as soon as you know it&#39;s available, you start expecting it and you start demanding it,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EBay offers a service, with couriers like Jacob Jones, at right above, and Victor Melendez, at left, that delivers items the same day they were ordered. Arianna Simpson, top right, of the online retailer Shoptiques made</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">same-day deliveries herself. More retailers are offering rush delivery despite the difficult and expensive logistics.

Same-day shipping is logistically complicated and money-losing - and may not even be a service that consumers want or need, analysts say. But retailers big and small are willing to take the risk. Even the Postal Service has introduced a same-day option for retailers. And the reason is simple: fear of Amazon.com.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, the world&#39;s biggest online retailer, has hinted that it will expand its same-day shipping service, giving customers the immediate gratification that has been the biggest advantage of brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Big retailers like Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Macy&#39;s and Target have worked with eBay to deliver items the same day, as have other old-line stores. Google has begun testing a local delivery service with several chains.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;There&#39;s lots going on in this space, and it&#39;s all driven by Amazon,&quot; said Tom Allason, founder and chief executive of Shutl, a British same-day delivery service that will expand to the United States next year. &quot;It&#39;s not really being driven by consumers at the moment.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The same-day delivery idea was a spectacular failure during the dot-com boom. Companies like Kozmo.com and Webvan went under because the services simply cost too much to be profitable. Amazon has offered same-day shipping since 2009, but with limits - only in big cities near Amazon warehouses on certain items ordered in the morning.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The geographical limits exist because Amazon had built warehouses far from major cities to avoid charging sales tax in certain states. But it has now given in on the sales tax fight, and in return, is erecting warehouses near cities like San Francisco, which analysts say is paving the way for faster, more widespread same-day delivery and spurring competitors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020121228e8cs0018k</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_071.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark136">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</a><a name="bookmark137">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">&#39;The Cloud&#39; Challenges Amazon</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By BRIAN X. CHEN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,005 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">27 December 2012 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CORRECTION APPENDEDFor some on Christmas Eve, &#39;&#39;White Christmas&#39;&#39; was a blackout on Netflix.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s because problems with Amazon&#39;s cloud computing service, which provides storage and computing power for all kinds of Web sites and services, caused Netflix to go down for much of the day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In updates on a Web site that reports on the status of its online services, Amazon traced the trouble to Elastic Load Balancing, a part of its service that helps spread heavy traffic among multiple servers to prevent overload. The company gave few details about the problems in its data center in Northern Virginia beyond this.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Social networks filled with complaints. Some customers also complained that Amazon&#39;s own streaming service, Amazon Prime, was down. Amazon said it had fixed the problem completely by the afternoon of Christmas Day, and Netflix said it had restored its services to most of the affected consumers by late Christmas Eve. But the episode highlighted how consumers are increasingly using &#39;&#39;the cloud.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As more everyday devices, appliances and even automobiles rely on services connected to the Internet, consumers expect those services to be available at all times. Yet all sorts of disruptions -- harsh weather conditions or an apparent overload -- can knock a service out for hours.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In October, problems with the same Amazon data center in Virginia took down Reddit, Foursquare and Heroku. The instance was explained on the status Web site as &#39;&#39;degraded performance&#39;&#39; in some parts of Amazon&#39;s storage service. In June, a lightning storm hit the Virginia data center, taking Netflix as well as Pinterest, Instagram and other sites off line for hours. That time, too, customers were offered little insight into what had happened.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In April 2011, an Amazon failure took down many smaller sites that had rented cloud storage space from the Internet giant. That time, the companies that were most affected were start-ups that were less likely to pay for so-called redundancies, or backup systems that kick in when a service fails. Netflix was not affected then, and said at the time it was because it had taken advantage of the redundancies that Amazon offers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Netflix has said that it has built several redundancies into its cloud-based system. For instance, it stores its data across multiple &#39;&#39;zones,&#39;&#39; so if there is a failure in one zone, it can retry in another. It says it also spends money on more capacity than it needs, so that if there are large spikes in customer activity, the service is less likely to go down.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Joris Evers, a Netflix spokesman, declined to elaborate on why Netflix went down despite these safeguards. He said the company was investigating the cause and would do what it could to prevent the interruption from recurring.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We are happy that people opening gifts of Netflix or Netflix-capable devices on Christmas morning could watch TV shows and movies and apologize for any inconvenience caused Christmas Eve,&#39;&#39; Mr. Evers said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tera Randall, an Amazon spokeswoman, said the company has been &#39;&#39;heads down&#39;&#39; to ensure services are running smoothly and that a full summary of the incident would be published in a few days.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is one of the biggest players in online services, hosting data storage and computation for hundreds of companies, including Netflix, Instagram and Pinterest. Once a sideline Amazon set up six years ago, the cloud service has since exploded into a business that is expected to bring in about $1 billion to the company this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other companies offer similar services, notably Google, which introduced its competitor in June. Microsoft is also in the business with Windows Azure.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although the service disruptions may annoy some companies and their customers, it&#39;s unlikely many businesses will end their partnerships with Amazon in light of this latest Netflix failure, said James McQuivey, an analyst for Forrester Research. He added that it was unlikely that a temporary service failure for Netflix was going to cause many to cancel subscriptions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said companies can pay extra to Amazon to add safeguards that increase reliability of their online services, but they typically choose to save costs and take the risk of their services going down temporarily. He said that Amazon has been especially popular among businesses because it has been gradually improving its services and lowering its costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Businesses, &#39;&#39;of course, are going to say, &#39;Gee, Amazon, what&#39;s going on?&#39; &#39;&#39; Mr. McQuivey said. &#39;&#39;But in reality they&#39;re all getting such a great deal. I don&#39;t see them getting that upset about it.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For consumers, though, it may be a different matter. On Christmas Eve, Merrilee and Alex Barton were watching an episode of &#39;&#39;It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&#39;&#39; when their Netflix feed started to stammer and finally froze, then began to buffer excessively. &#39;&#39;It would try to load and get to about 2 to 7 percent of the way through and then just hang there for five minutes,&#39;&#39; Mrs. Barton said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eventually the two said they gave up and -- with nothing else going on in Farmingdale, N.Y. -- decided to &#39;&#39;nerd it up.&#39;&#39; They played a few games of Minecraft, a video game in which the players can build whatever they wish. In the game, all the technology worked.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Correction: December 28, 2012, Friday</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about problems with Amazon&#39;s cloud computing service referred incorrectly at one point to the company&#39;s public comments on the issue. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, Tera Randall, an Amazon spokeswoman, said that the company was working to ensure services were running smoothly and that Amazon would publish a full summary within a few days. It is not the case that Amazon &#39;&#39;did not offer an official statement or explanation.&#39;&#39; The article also misstated the month that problems at an Amazon data center in Virginia took down Reddit, Foursquare and Heroku. That occurred in October, not last month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020121228e8cr0000s</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_072.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark138">B</a><a name="bookmark139">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">&#39;THE CLOUD&#39; CHALLENGES AMAZON</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By BRIAN X CHEN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">47 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">27 December 2012</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.

They&#39;re rectangular, their screens are black and white, and all can&#39;t do much more than display text.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So how do you liven things up? For starters, Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble added lighting systems to their newest readers, the Kindle Paperwhite and the Nook Simple Touch, to make it easier for people to read in the dark.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Amazon&#39;s Kindle Paperwhite, four LEDs mounted on the bottom of the reader shoot light toward the surface of the display. Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s lighting, called GlowLight, has a similar system with LEDs. Both these glowing</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-book readers cost $120.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But will adding some lights be enough to prevent e-book readers from becoming an endangered species? The International Data Corporation, a research firm, said shipments of tablets, smartphones and PCs grew 27.1 percent from last year. However, e-book readers are losing momentum. In the United States, manufacturers sold nine million e-book readers this year, down from 15.5 million last year, according to Forrester Research.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So why would anyone still want a reader? Readers are still much cheaper than tablets in general; the cheapest Kindle costs $70, while the cheapest Kindle Fire tablet costs $160. And if all you want to do is read books, a dedicated reader is still the best device for the job, said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester analyst.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GRAPHIC: Light Reading: The Kindle Paperwhite uses a unique lighting system to illuminate its electronic ink display. Rather than using a backlight as on LCD-based tablets, the Paperwhite uses a transparent light guide that directs light from four edge-mounted LEDs down toward the surface of the display.

The major publishers and traditional bookstores were contemplating a future that would pass them by.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But doomsday has not arrived, at least not yet. As four of the publishers have entered into settlements with regulators and revised the way they sell e-books, prices have selectively fallen but not as broadly or drastically as anticipated.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The $10 floor that publishers fought so hard to maintain for popular new novels is largely intact. Amazon, for instance, is selling Michael Connelly’s new mystery, “The Black Box,” for $12.74. New best sellers by David Baldacci and James Patterson cost just over $11.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One big reason for the lack of fireworks is that the triumph of e-books over their physical brethren is not happening quite as fast as forecast.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The e-book market isn’t growing at the caffeinated level it was,” said Michael Norris, a Simba Information analyst who follows the publishing industry. “Even retailers like Amazon have to be wondering, how far can we go — or should we go — to make our prices lower than the other guys if it’s not helping us with market share?”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adult e-book sales through August were up 34 percent from 2011, an impressive rate of growth if you forget that sales have doubled every year for the last four years. And there have been more recent signs of a market pausing for breath.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/12/a-message-from-john-sargent" class="s1" target="_blank">Macmillan, the only publisher that has not settled with the Justice Department, said last week </a><a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/12/a-message-from-john-sargent" class="a" target="_blank">as part of a</a><a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/12/a-message-from-john-sargent" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/12/a-message-from-john-sargent" class="a" target="_blank">statement from John Sargent</a>, its chief executive, that “our e-book business has been softer of late, particularly for the last few weeks, even as the number of reading devices continues to grow.” His laconic conclusion: “Interesting.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Norris said Simba, which regularly surveys e-book buyers, has been noticing what it calls “commitment to content” issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“A lot of these e-book consumers aren’t behaving like lab rats at a feeder bar,” the analyst said. “We have found that at any given time about a third of e-book users haven’t bought a single title in the last 12 months. I have a feeling it is the digital equivalent of the ‘overloaded night stand’ effect; someone isn’t going to buy any more books until they make a dent in reading the ones they have already acquired.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another, more counterintuitive possibility is that the 2011 demise of Borders, the second-biggest chain, dealt a surprising blow to the e-book industry. Readers could no longer see what they wanted to go home and order. “The print industry has been aiding and assisting the e-book industry since the beginning,” Mr. Norris said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is possible that Amazon, which controls about 60 percent of the e-book market, is merely holding back with price cuts for the right moment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next few weeks are when e-book sales traditionally take a big jump, as all those newly received devices are loaded up with content.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon declined to comment beyond saying, “We have lowered prices for customers from the prices publishers set on a broad assortment of Kindle books.” Barnes &amp; Noble declined to comment on its pricing strategy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The question of the proper price for e-books has shadowed the industry ever since Amazon introduced the Kindle in late 2007 and created the first truly popular portable reading device. Amazon had a natural impulse to build a market and was an aggressive retailer in any case, so it took best sellers that cost $25 in independent bookstores and sold them for $9.99 as e-books. Consumers liked that. E-book adoption soared.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a typical ebullient forecast, James McQuivey, a Forrester analyst, wrote two years ago that digital book sales would be $2.8 billion by 2015, up from a mere $169 million in 2009. “A very altered publishing world is about to emerge,” his report said. (He said last week that he was not tempering his forecast.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Publishers, however, did not want to see their product sold so cheaply by Amazon, which would accelerate the shift away from the printed books they still depended on. With the help of Apple, they introduced a new system that gave them greater control over prices, which went up. The Justice Department found this to be illegal collusion and in April, sued.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/advocacy/last-call-tell-doj-dont-help-amazon-target-booksellers/" class="s1" target="_blank">After the suit was filed, Amazon said it looked forward to lowering prices. The industry braced itself. The Authors Guild predicted the end of the physical bookstore. “Amazon is committed to capturing the U.S. book market by forcibly moving it online, where it can more easily eliminate its competitors,”</a> the guild wrote<span class="p">. Paul Aiken, the guild’s executive director, did not return calls for comment last week.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the summer wore on and publishers negotiated with the government, Amazon customers began asking why they did not immediately notice a change. “It seems to me that the Kindle books have gone up,” D. Amick wrote in a typical comment on an Amazon forum.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.the-digital-reader.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">Some say they never expected a price war at all. “The pricing war hasn’t happened because Amazon can’t afford it,” said Nate Hoffelder of the </a>Digital Reader<span class="p">, a site devoted to e-book news and opinion. “The money Amazon lost on e-book discounts in 2008, 2009 was covered, at least in part, by the high price of Kindle hardware,” he said. “Now that the Kindle is being sold so cheap, Amazon no longer has the hardware income to act as a cushion.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is debatable — Amazon has always devoted itself to market share rather than profitability — but it is undeniable that the cost of e-readers has plunged much more than the cost of e-books. When the Kindle made its debut it was a big hit at $399. The cheapest model is now $69. Barnes &amp; Noble is selling its cheapest Nook for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$79, discounted from $99.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.isuppli.com/home-and-consumer-electronics/marketwatch/pages/ebook-readers-device-to-go-the-way-of-dinosaurs.aspx" class="s1" target="_blank">Even as prices fall, though, the dedicated e-reader is losing steam.

By 2016, the forecast is for seven million devices — as opposed to 340 million tablets, which allow for e-reading and so much more.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jordan Selburn, senior principal analyst for consumer platforms at IHS, said the migration from e-readers to tablets puts Amazon in “an interesting position” with e-book prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Amazon does not make much off the hardware,” he said. “Its goal is to sell you content. When they sell you a Kindle Fire tablet, they are not just selling you books but movies, diapers, garden hose. It’s a portal into their entire store.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But one day, Amazon must try to make a profit. “In the era of the tablet, the difference between a book and diaper disappears,” the analyst said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps there will be loss leaders, but more likely each product will have to carry its own weight.

Critics of the rise of sock puppets have also aimed at a retired librarian from Atlanta who has more than 25,000 reviews, almost all of them granting four or five stars.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/technology/e-book-price-war-has-yet-to-arrive.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;pagewanted=all" class="s1" target="_blank">The settlement with the government of e-book pricing that was intended to counteract an anticompetitive agreement between the big publishers and Apple hasn&#39;t yet led to more competition, </a>David Streitfeld reports<span class="p">.

This includes authors.” But writers say that rule is not applied consistently.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In some cases, the ax fell on those with a direct relationship with the author.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.edwardwrobertson.com/2012/11/update-on-amazons-disappearing-reviews.html" class="s1" target="_blank">“My sister’s and best friend’s reviews were removed from my books,” the author M.

On Nov. 20, publication day, dozens of highly favorable reviews immediately sprouted. Other reviewers </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/on-amazon-cooking-up-friendly-reviews/" class="a" target="_blank">quickly criticized Mr. Ferriss,</a> <span style=" color: #000;">accusing him of buying supporters.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He laughed off those suggestions. “Not only would I never do that — it’s unethical — I simply don’t have to,” he wrote in an e-mail, saying he had sent several hundred review copies to fans and potential fans. “Does that stack the deck? Perhaps, but why send the book to someone who would hate it? That doesn’t help anyone: not the reader, nor the writer.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a demonstration of social media’s grip on reviewing, Mr. Ferriss used Twitter and Facebook to ask for a review. “Rallying my readers,” he called it. Within an hour, 61 had complied.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J94GMUAFHC6C/ref%3Dcm_srch_res_rtr_alt_1" class="s1" target="_blank">A few of his early reviews were written by people who admitted they had not read the book but were giving it five stars anyway because, well, they knew it would be terrific. “I am looking forward to reading this,” </a>wrote a user<span class="s4"> </span><span class="p">posting under the name mhpics.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A spokesman for Amazon, which published “The 4-Hour Chef,” offered this sole comment for this article: “We do not require people to have experienced the product in order to review.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The dispute over reviews is playing out in the discontent over Mrs. Klausner, an Amazon Hall of Fame reviewer for the last 11 years and undoubtedly one of the most prolific reviewers in literary history.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://harriet-rules.blogspot.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">Mrs. Klausner published review No. 28,366, for “A Red Sun Also Rises” by Mark Hodder. Almost immediately, it had nine critical comments. The first accused it of being “riddled with errors in grammar, spelling and punctuation.” The rest were no more kind. The </a><a href="http://harriet-rules.blogspot.com/" class="a" target="_blank">Harriet Klausner Appreciation Society</a> <span style=" color: #000;">had struck again.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mrs. Klausner, a 60-year-old retired librarian who lives in Atlanta, has published an average of seven reviews a day for more than a decade. “To watch her in action is unbelievable,” said her husband, Stanley. “You see the pages turning.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mrs. Klausner, who says ailments keep her home and insomnia keeps her up, scoffs at her critics. “You ever read a Harlequin romance?” she said. “You can finish it in one hour. I’ve always been a speed reader.” She has a message for her naysayers: “Get a life. Read a book.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">More than 99.9 percent of Mrs. Klausner’s reviews are four or five stars. “If I can make it past the first 50 pages, that means I like it, and so I review it,” she said. But even Stanley said, “She’s soft, I won’t deny that.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The campaign against Mrs. Klausner has pushed down her reviewer ratings, which in theory makes her less influential.

That market grew 27.1 percent from last year, to 303.6 million shipments, according to IDC.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, e-book readers are losing momentum. This year, worldwide shipments of e-book readers will fall to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14.9 million units from 23.2 million units last year - a 36 percent drop, according to estimates by IHS iSuppli. The research firm eMarketer noted these trends in a<a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1009555" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><span class="s3">report published on Thursday</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Forrester Research is seeing a similar trend. In the United States, manufacturers sold nine million e-book readers this year, down from 15.5 million last year, according to Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester analyst. Next year, the number of e-book readers sold will be 7.5 million units, and in 2014 that number will drop to 5.3 million and keep falling from there, Forrester predicts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Does it make much sense anymore to buy e-book readers? They are still far cheaper than tablets - the cheapest Kindle costs $70, while the cheapest Kindle Fire tablet costs $160. But many people are choosing to pay extra to get the features of a tablet, Ms. Rotman Epps said. In a survey conducted by Forrester, 12 percent of respondents said they had bought a tablet instead of an e-book reader, and 39 percent of tablet owners said they wouldn&#39;t buy an e-book reader in the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s looking like e-readers were a device for a particular moment in time that, more rapidly than we or anyone else thought, has been replaced by a new technology,&quot; Ms. Rotman Epps said in an interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That doesn&#39;t mean Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble, which have been big sellers of e-book readers, need to worry. Those companies have been offering touch-screen tablets for a while now. The companies that will be most vulnerable to this trend are those that primarily make e-book readers, like Kobo, Ms. Rotman Epps said.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/pulp-friction-the-debate-over-amazons-fire/" class="a" target="_blank">Pulp Friction: The Kindle </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/pulp-friction-the-debate-over-amazons-fire/" target="_blank">Debate</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/7-inch-tablets/" class="a" target="_blank">How Are 7-Inch Tablets </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/7-inch-tablets/" target="_blank">Doing?</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/fired-up-about-the-kindle-fire/" class="a" target="_blank">Fired Up About the Kindle </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/fired-up-about-the-kindle-fire/" target="_blank">Fire</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/amazon-apple-tablets-flash/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon and Apple&#39;s Giant Markups on Flash </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/amazon-apple-tablets-flash/" target="_blank">Storage</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon Hints About Fire&#39;s Sales Success<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020121220e8ck00439</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_081.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark156">Media Decoder</a><a name="bookmark157">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business; Media &amp; Advertising</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Karmazin Leaves Sirius XM Earlier Than Expected</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By BEN SISARIO</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">556 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19 December 2012 NYT Blogs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2012 The New York Times Company.

Apple led the pack with iTunes Match, which for $25 a year matches a user&#39;s songs to those in a master database, thus bypassing the often cumbersome process of uploading each file. (To do that you need special licenses from music companies, which Google and Amazon at first did not have.)</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/amazon-revamps-its-cloud-music-player-to-compete-with-itunes/" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon added scan-and-match in </a>July<a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/google-signs-deal-with-warner-music-group/" class="s1" target="_blank">, and this fall Google</a>caught up too<span class="p">, first in Europe and then yesterday in the United States.

That deal, in which Bertelsmann will assume 53 percent control of the new company, was announced in October.

Apple championed this agency model.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For print books, by contrast, publishers act as wholesalers, charging retailers about half the cover price for a book and then allowing retailers to set their own price to consumers. Amazon built a huge business by offering consumers discounts under this wholesale model.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Publishers fear that under the wholesale model, Amazon can sell e-books for less than it pays, taking a loss in the short term to drive smaller competitors out of business, thus gaining a monopoly, to the detriment of the publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">European Union officials, however, see things differently: that collusion by publishers would lead to higher prices for consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Obviously, the coordination of commercial behavior between competitors — here, with the help of Apple — is forbidden by our competition rules,” Mr. Almunia said in Brussels in a statement. “Whatever the publishers’ initial concerns about retail prices, dealing with this situation through collusion is not acceptable.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under terms of the settlement, Apple and the publishers agreed to immediately end their preferred agency agreements, the legal pacts that contained “most favored customer” clauses effectively blocking sales to price discounters. Apple and the publishers, Mr. Almunia said, tried to make the agreements standard in the industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon and other online retailers that refused to agree to the group’s pricing terms, Mr. Almunia said, “were told they might not be supplied with e-books if they did not agree to the switch.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Retailers had little option but to surrender their discretion in setting retail prices if they wanted to avoid a serious disruption of their business,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The decision by Mr. Almunia, a Spanish jurist who has set a pattern of compromise since becoming Europe’s top antitrust officer in February 2010, followed a similar resolution in the United States. In September, a federal judge approved the U.S. Justice Department’s settlement with HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster and Hachette.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Almunia had opened the European investigation in December 2010. He had signaled recently that a compromise was in the works, and the announcement on Thursday was seen as no surprise by European competition lawyers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jean-François Bellis, a lawyer in Brussels who represented Microsoft in its own multiyear European antitrust case, said Mr. Almunia’s settlement in the e-book case reflected his preference for fast, inexpensive solutions to corporate attempts to abuse market dominance.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“This is something indeed that was expected,” Mr. Bellis said. “I am seeing more and more that the commission is resorting to settlements. This is a more practical approach than fines and lengthy prosecutions.” Apple benefits from the resolution because it will not have to pay a fine, Mr. Bellis said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The regulator’s decision will not help the fragile situation of many publishers, said Françoise Dubruille, director of the European and International Booksellers Federation, a Brussels group representing the 27 E.U. national bookselling organizations, which in turn have many small and medium-size publishers, in addition to large groups, as members.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Dubruille said the settlement would effectively further Amazon’s ability to set the purchase price of e-books in Europe, which would not help a struggling publishing industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We aren’t happy about this,” Ms. Dubruille said of the decision. “We think the big players in this industry have disproportionate power and influence in the digital market. We want to see fair competition. This might look like a victory for consumers, but in the long run, this is bad news, because the pressures on prices will increase.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Apple and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

He had just left the Starbucks opposite London&#39;s Angel underground station, having squeezed past around 50 protesters accusing the coffee chain of tax evasion, hypocrisy and hating women.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the circumstances, his insistence on standing in front of them and finishing off his Starbucks cup of coffee was rather brave. I asked if he was making some kind of anti-anti-capitalism statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;m actually doing the P.R. for Starbucks,&quot; he said. &quot;Oh, do you want to give me an interview?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Definitely not,&quot; he replied with a grimace, turned his back and walked away.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I have no way of knowing if he was really doing P.R. or simply had a peculiar sense of humor, but much of the Starbucks P.R. team must share his distaste for talking to British journalists right now, given the scale of the challenge they face.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/15/us-britain-starbucks-tax-idUKBRE89E0EX20121015" class="s1" target="_blank">After </a><a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/15/us-britain-starbucks-tax-idUKBRE89E0EX20121015" class="a" target="_blank">an investigation by Reuters published in October</a> <span style=" color: #000;">revealed the chain had paid no corporate tax in Britain for 14 of the last 15 years, it has become a target for protesters angered by the British government&#39;s austerity program, and for politicians demanding an end to tax avoidance.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Starbucks U.K. paid another Starbucks subsidiary in The Netherlands royalties for the right to the company brand, and paid a third subsidiary in Switzerland for buying coffee. That meant Starbucks as a whole could book its income in the lower-tax Dutch and Swiss jurisdictions and show no taxable income in Britain at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Starbucks insists that its financial arrangements are entirely legal, and the tax authorities have never questioned them, but many of its customers are still appalled.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the past three years, economic growth here has been almost nonexistent, the government has cut spending on almost everything, yet Starbucks sold close to $1.9 billion worth of coffee and food, and paid less tax on its income than one of its baristas. The appearance of unfairness has touched a nerve.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://starbucks.co.uk/blog/an-open-letter-from-kris-engskov/1249" class="s1" target="_blank">Amid a growing customer boycott, Starbucks</a>agreed last week to pay $32 million in taxes over the next two years<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;While Starbucks has complied with all U.K. tax laws, today we are announcing changes that will result in the company paying higher corporation tax in the U.K. Specifically, Starbucks will not claim tax deductions for royalties and standard intercompany charges,&quot;

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Amazon.com introduced its first tablet last year, one of the harshest reviews came from Jakob Nielsen, the usability expert. He slammed the Kindle Fire for offering &quot;a disappointingly poor&quot; experience.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;If I were given to conspiracy theories, I&#39;d say that Amazon deliberately designed a poor Web browsing user experience to keep Fire users from shopping on competing sites,&#39;&#39; Mr. Nielsen told Bits. His blunt comments sparked their own conspiracy theories: that he was somehow doing Apple&#39;s bidding by criticizing a cheaper competitor of the iPad. But then, just about everyone who didn&#39;t like the Fire last year was accused by the more extreme Fire fans of being an Apple cultist.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Nielsen, principal of the Nielsen Norman Group, a Silicon Valley consulting firm, predicted that the retailer would get just &quot;one more shot&quot; at establishing itself in the tablet marketplace. &quot;If that&#39;s a failure,&quot; he added, &quot;then the Fire is doomed to the dust pile of history.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As the second generation of Fires - 9-inch and 7-inch devices - seem to likely to pile up under Christmas trees shortly, we asked Mr. Nielsen what he thought. If Amazon is going to collapse in a heap of busted dreams, we want to be on the inside track.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Nielsen kindly agreed to check the devices out. When he did, he was pleasantly surprised. There was much that needed to be improved in the earlier model, and it was.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Last year&#39;s Fire was like a Ford Model T,&quot; he said. &quot;You had to start out by hand-cranking it forever, and it was still prone to breaking down. Now it&#39;s a Model A from the 1930s - a real car. You can drive it places.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some things he particularly liked:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">--- The e-mail reader. &quot;It is a very well-designed piece of software that took me only seconds to set up. It&#39;s better than the iPad e-mail reader in small ways.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">-- Less glare. &quot;Last year, if you turned the Fire off, it was almost like looking into a mirror. This year, there&#39;s some reflection but not as much.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- Just about everything else. &quot;It&#39;s more pleasant for a lot of uses - Web browsing, using applications, watching movies. The hardware has improved a good deal. The pixel density is better, so the text is clearer and easier to read.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some things he didn&#39;t like:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- There is no ability to enlarge the text in the Web browser. &quot;If you&#39;re trying to squeeze in Web pages, the text tends to get small. How serious a problem this is depends on how good your eyesight is.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- The app selection. Apple has an edge with developers of several years and several hundred thousand apps.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- The 9-inch Fire might have a bigger screen, but it isn&#39;t optimized to take advantage of it by showing more information, such as more items in a table of contents, or more paragraphs in an article.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Nielsen&#39;s bottom line:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If you want a small device, for financial reasons or because you want to carry it in your purse, the smaller Fire is better than the iPad Mini. The 10-inch iPad is probably better than 9-inch Fire, but not by a lot.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The masses do not appear to be quite as enthusiastic as Mr. Nielsen. The 7-inch Fire, for instance, has 368</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">one-star reviews on Amazon, about 10 percent of the total.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intel prides itself on having some of the smartest engineers around. When it comes to the world&#39;s largest computing systems, however, the chip giant now takes a back seat to a certain kind of powerful new customer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon work with Intel could mean a lot for much of the rest of the technology industry. Their needs on things like computing power and energy consumption get a lot of attention from Intel, which expects many other companies to eventually build big systems of their own.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diane Bryant, who runs Intel&#39;s data center group, would not identify Intel&#39;s Big Four, other than to say they were all American companies. It is most likely she meant Google, which leads in search; Facebook, the dominant social media company; Amazon, which has the biggest cloud rental business; and Microsoft, which uses the cloud for search and media services, as well as corporate computing. Put together, they represent a diverse array of needs, calling for different technology approaches.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The Big Four operate at a very different beat rate, and they are very tech savvy, so they don&#39;t want a lot of input,&quot; said Ms. Bryant. &quot;They all get a dedicated salesperson, the same as the others in our Top 40 customers, but there is a lot more direct innovation from them, and a lot of sharing of ideas.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chinese companies like Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba, she said, were building their own clouds quickly, she said. As costs drop, even more service providers are likely to join.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Bryant&#39;s Big Four have become active centers of innovation, product testing, and future engineering choices for some of Intel&#39;s most critical semiconductors. A server chip introduced to the general public last March, she noted, was first installed in three of the Big Four the preceding September because the customers were willing to sacrifice possible production kinks in order to have the latest chip.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It was a new thing for us,&quot; she said. In exchange, they provide Intel with a lot of early information about how the chip is performing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The information is particularly useful as Intel strives to make its data center business recover some of the loss suffered in the collapse of the personal computer market. In the first nine months of 2012, Intel&#39;s PC client group had revenue of $25.8 billion, a drop of 2.25 percentage points from the first three quarters of the previous year. The data center business pulled in $7.9 billion, an increase of 6.7 percent. Ms. Bryant has told her bosses that she&#39;ll double annual revenue, to $20 billion, by 2016.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/facebooks-5-percent-solution-in-data-centers/" class="s1" target="_blank">The intense relationship with Intel is not the only way that the cloud giants seek to influence the computer markets.

The methods cited in the patent might give too many clues about what Google is doing next.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/intels-new-chip-a-best-defense-in-the-cloud/" class="a" target="_blank">Intel&#39;s New Chip: A Best Defense in the </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/intels-new-chip-a-best-defense-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank">Cloud</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/the-aws-software-store/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Creates a Software Rental </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/the-aws-software-store/" target="_blank">Store</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/daily-report-tech-giants-scramble-to-meet-the-challenges-of-a-mobile-world/" class="a" target="_blank">Daily Report: Tech Giants Scramble to Meet the Challenges of a Mobile </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/daily-report-tech-giants-scramble-to-meet-the-challenges-of-a-mobile-world/" target="_blank">World</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/how-windows-8-transforms-enterprise-computing/" class="a" target="_blank">How Windows 8 Transforms Enterprise </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/how-windows-8-transforms-enterprise-computing/" target="_blank">Computing</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Daily Report: Google Keeps Pushing at Microsoft&#39;s Windows<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020121205e8c5003e9</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_089.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark172">finance</a><a name="bookmark173">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">U.K. to pursue firms that avoid tax</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By ERIC PFANNER</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">590 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 December 2012 International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">15</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2012 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The British government on Monday announced plans to crack down on tax dodgers, as a parliamentary report criticized American companies for what it described as tax avoidance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said he had earmarked an additional £77 million, or $124 million, for a campaign against ‘‘offshore evasion and avoidance by wealthy individuals and multinationals.’’ The push, the Treasury said in a statement, was expected to yield £2 billion in additional annual revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The drive comes amid growing criticism in Britain and elsewhere in Europe of the fiscal policies of several American companies that pay little tax on the billions of pounds and euros in sales that they generate in the region.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Global companies with huge operations in the U.K., generating significant amounts of income, are getting away with paying little or no corporation tax here,’’ said Margaret Hodge, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament, in a report published Monday. ‘‘This is outrageous and an insult to British businesses and individuals who pay their fair share.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The report focused on the tax practices of Starbucks, Amazon and Google, criticizing their policy of using lower-tax jurisdictions within Europe, like Ireland, Luxembourg and Switzerland, to record much of the revenue they generate in higher-tax countries like Britain, France and Germany. Companies like Google then transfer money they earn in Europe to Bermuda or other locations, thereby deferring or avoiding U.S. taxes as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At parliamentary hearings last month, executives of Google, Amazon and Starbucks maintained that their tax policies were perfectly legal, because European Union law lets companies based in one member state operate across the 27-country bloc.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But tax investigators in several countries, including France, are looking into whether the practice, which is also employed by European companies, is legal. Amazon recently disclosed that it had received a bill from the French fiscal authorities for $252 million in back taxes, adding that it was contesting the claim.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Starbucks said Monday that it was reviewing its British tax practices, after the company disclosed recently that it had paid no corporate tax in Britain last year, despite generating £398 million in sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘To maintain and further build public trust we need to do more,’’ Starbucks said in a statement. ‘‘The company has been in discussions with H.M.R.C. for some time’’ — a reference to Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs, the British tax collection agency — ‘‘and is also in talks with the Treasury.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Google declined to comment Monday but has previously insisted that its tax practices comply with British law. Amazon did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The British parliamentary report stopped short of accusing the companies of tax fraud but said their explanations had been ‘‘unconvincing and, in some cases, evasive.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The inescapable conclusion is that multinationals are using structures and exploiting current tax legislation to move offshore profits that are clearly generated from economic activity in the U.K.,’’ Ms. Hodge said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The committee also criticized Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs, saying it had been ‘‘too lenient.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The government said it would hire experts to investigate ‘‘transfer pricing arrangements,’’ which multinational companies use to reduce their tax liability in higher-tax jurisdictions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The Government is clear that while most taxpayers are doing their bit to help us balance the books, it is unacceptable for a minority to avoid paying their fair share, sometimes by breaking the law,’’ Mr. Osborne said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020121204e8c40000a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_090.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark174">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark175">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">On Amazon, Cooking Up Friendly Reviews</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">903 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 December 2012 NYT Blogs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2012 The New York Times Company.

Amazon has not explained exactly why.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One possible target: authors who have sent gift certificates to reviewers to buy their books. While it&#39;s easy to see the potential for abuse here -- &quot;Here&#39;s a $100 gift certificate. Buy a copy of my novel for 99 cents and keep the change&quot; -- some writers argue it is no different than sending a physical copy of a book to someone, which is what publishers do in the offline world and therefore is allowed by Amazon. At least, the line between the two is blurry.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2011/03/10/12-lessons-learned-while-marketing-the-4-hour-body/#more-4904" class="s1" target="_blank">Consider the case of Tim Ferriss, the self-help specialist whose extensive promotional activities help power his books onto the best-seller lists.

Some went to friends, some to companies where Mr. Ferriss had been a guest speaker, still more to those who helped or volunteered to help with the book. On publication day, all the recipients were sent an e-mail marked urgent asking them to spend 30 seconds writing a review. Many complied. But some readers saw something suspicious.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2011/03/10/12-lessons-learned-while-marketing-the-4-hour-body/#more-4904" class="s1" target="_blank">&quot;Although this generated a fair amount of backlash from skeptics, it was an immense boon for us to have a solid foundation of 200 positive reviews in the first week,&quot; a Ferriss marketing associate </a><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2011/03/10/12-lessons-learned-while-marketing-the-4-hour-body/#more-4904" class="a" target="_blank">wrote in a guest post</a> <span style=" color: #000;">on the author&#39;s blog in March 2011. &quot;Having a solid Amazon rating gives the book an enormous amount of social proof that can last for years, and (although immeasurable from our end) boosts the conversion rate on the sales page substantially.&quot;</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RX3DC8D2K4TD9/ref%3Dcm_srch_res_rtr_alt_10" class="s1" target="_blank">Two weeks ago, Mr. Ferriss brought out his third book, &quot;The 4-Hour Chef.&quot; Published this time by Amazon itself, the nearly 700-page tome came equipped with many five-star reviews posted on the date of publication. Only a few of the reviewers said they had gotten advance copies. Once again, some readers saw something suspicious. &quot;Tons of fake ratings have been posted on the first day that this book came out,&quot; </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RX3DC8D2K4TD9/ref%3Dcm_srch_res_rtr_alt_10" class="a" target="_blank">posted a reader</a> <span style=" color: #000;">who goes by carmex. &quot;Please do not encourage this type of behavior.&quot;</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SGR4JK9FDZCN/ref%3Dcm_srch_res_rtr_alt_1" class="s1" target="_blank">A debate </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SGR4JK9FDZCN/ref%3Dcm_srch_res_rtr_alt_1" class="a" target="_blank">sprang up</a> <span style=" color: #000;">about whether it was permissible to solicit advance reviews from friends and others you strongly suspected were going to give you a rave. &quot;Would you consider those reviews as being within the spirit and integrity of what a review should be or is that more akin to network marketing?&quot; asked one reader, who put himself in the second group.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ferriss said in an e-mail message that he sent out from 200 to 300 advance copies of &quot;The 4-Hour Chef&quot; to &quot;people I identified as being potentially interested in my book and who would probably enjoy the content. Does that stack the deck? Perhaps, but why send the book to someone who would hate it? That doesn&#39;t help anyone: not the reader, nor the writer. &quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some critics noted that some of Mr. Ferriss&#39; fans had written no other reviews -- usually a tip-off that the reviewer has been paid or was a friend of the author. &quot;No conspiracy required,&quot; Mr. Ferriss said. &quot;How many people routinely leave Amazon reviews? Very few. Even reading as much as I do, I very rarely leave book reviews. But if a writer I loved, one who&#39;d written more than 400 blog posts for free (as I have) -- posts I benefited from -- asked me to do so as a 30-second favor, would I be inclined? Absolutely. That would make me a new reviewer.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The most controversial of Mr. Ferriss&#39; reviewers are not reviewers at all. These are fans who straightforwardly admit they haven&#39;t read the book, but nevertheless give it four or five stars:</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QH648QA31DB7/ref%3Dcm_srch_res_rtr_alt_1" class="s1" target="_blank">&quot;It baffles me how excited I am to have this book in my hands -- Just arrived home and it was sitting on my porch waiting for me,&quot; </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QH648QA31DB7/ref%3Dcm_srch_res_rtr_alt_1" class="a" target="_blank">wrote one &quot;reviewer.&quot;</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVP5TIENHIE1/ref%3Dcm_srch_res_rtr_alt_8" class="s1" target="_blank">&quot;Just ordered this hope it&#39;s as good as the other titles,&quot; </a><u>said a second</u><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RC7GK7FBVE9PA/ref%3Dcm_srch_res_rtr_alt_2" class="s1" target="_blank">. &quot;I&#39;ll write a review once I&#39;m finished,&quot; </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RC7GK7FBVE9PA/ref%3Dcm_srch_res_rtr_alt_2" target="_blank">exclaimed a third.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surprisingly, Amazon says it is completely legitimate to do this. &quot;We do not require people to have experienced the product in order to review,&quot; Craig Berman, an Amazon spokeman, said. &quot;Some people write reviews on why they decided not to buy, or write a review as a gift giver rather than the product owner.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps, but I see a future where we have virtual enthusiasm for virtual books. Reviews are crucial to online commerce in a way they never were to offline sales. If Amazon can devise a system that is transparent and fair to all involved -- author, reviewer and customer -- it will be a greater achievement than same-day delivery.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/tim-ferriss-and-amazon-try-to-reinvent-publishing/" class="a" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss and Amazon Try to Reinvent </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/tim-ferriss-and-amazon-try-to-reinvent-publishing/" target="_blank">Publishing</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/bestsellers-from-a-vanished-world/" class="a" target="_blank">Best Sellers From a Vanished </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/bestsellers-from-a-vanished-world/" target="_blank">World</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/questions-for-amazon-on-privacy-and-the-kindle-fire/" class="a" target="_blank">Questions for Amazon on Privacy and the Kindle </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/questions-for-amazon-on-privacy-and-the-kindle-fire/" target="_blank">Fire</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/inside-amazons-very-hot-warehouse/" class="a" target="_blank">Inside Amazon&#39;s Very Hot </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/inside-amazons-very-hot-warehouse/" target="_blank">Warehouse</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon Offers a New Way to Shop - on an iPad<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020121204e8c400462</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_091.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark176">Business/Financial Desk; SECTA</a><a name="bookmark177">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Retail Frenzy: Prices on Web Change Hourly</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,250 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 December 2012 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The day before Thanksgiving, Amazon was offering a discounted price of $49.96 on a popular Xbox game, the same price as Walmart and 3 cents lower than Target.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then the holiday pricing shuffle began.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon dropped its price on the game, Dance Central 3, to $24.99 on Thanksgiving Day, matching Best Buy&#39;s &#39;&#39;doorbuster&#39;&#39; special, and went to $15 once Walmart stores offered the game at that lower price. Amazon then brought the price up, down, down again, up and up again -- in all, seven price changes in seven days.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The unluckiest buyer paid more than triple the price that the luckiest buyer paid.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Retail price wars online have entered a new era of speed and precision, creating a confusing landscape for shoppers in which prices leap and plummet on short notice. In the old days, merchants sent employees into competitors&#39; stores to check on pricing, and days later &#39;&#39;sale&#39;&#39; signs reflected new markdowns. Now, sophisticated computer programs accomplish the same goal online within hours, and even minutes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The battle was fierce over the holiday weekend. At the request of The New York Times, the pricing firm Dynamite Data tracked prices at three major online retailers -- Walmart.com, Amazon.com and Target.com -- starting the week before Thanksgiving and going through Tuesday, after most heavy promotions ended.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The data shows that retailers paid close attention to competitors&#39; online prices and in-store specials, battling to undercut one another by as little as 2 cents and forcing each other into out-of-stock positions as they pushed prices down. Retailers fight to have the lowest prices to increase sales volume, aid in search-result prominence and help burnish a thrifty reputation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;There was definitely some gamesmanship going on,&#39;&#39; said Diana Schulz, chief executive of Dynamite Data, which tracks online retail pricing, stock status, ratings and other information for clients like Samsung and Abt Electronics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Amazon has long tinkered with prices, its competitors are now fighting back. In the last year, Walmart invested heavily in pricing tools, a Walmart eCommerce spokesman, Dan Toporek, said. Dynamite Data said there had been a marked increase in how much Walmart played with prices, and smaller retailers, including GameStop, Best Buy and Toys &#39;&#39;R&#39;&#39; Us, were now also adjusting some prices at least daily.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The goal is to attract shoppers with competitively priced products that show up on Web searches, but there is risk, too: some consumers tire of price whiplash.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;People are starting to realize, &#39;I can&#39;t trust the price I&#39;m getting, because it might change,&#39; &#39;&#39; a pricing consultant, Rafi Mohammed, said. Shoppers have few ways to gain an advantage -- ordering the same product at different prices requires expensive return shipments -- but Mr. Mohammed said retailers had an opportunity to soothe consumers by offering refunds for price adjustments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The parrying could be seen with a Nintendo game, Mario Kart DS.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A week before Thanksgiving, the retailers&#39; prices varied, with Amazon selling it at $29.17, Walmart at $40.88, and Target at $33.99, according to Dynamite Data. Through Thanksgiving, as Target kept the price stable, Walmart</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">changed prices six times, and Amazon five. On Thanksgiving itself, Walmart marked down the price to its advertised $29.96, which Amazon matched.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Schulz said sophisticated retailers set algorithms to change prices in response to competitors. &#39;&#39;Retailers pipe a bunch of information in electronically, like internal information -- cost, availability of inventory, sales goals,&#39;&#39; along with competitors&#39; prices, she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The software also lets retailers establish rules on the pricing of certain products: always price Furbys 5 percent below Kmart, for example, or make sure some goods are priced at an average of Amazon&#39;s and Walmart&#39;s prices. Generally, pricing managers also manually adjust prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Toporek said Walmart.com used a combination of computer tools and human adjustments. On popular items, like Walmart&#39;s best sellers, the site tries to &#39;&#39;maintain low prices on the items people want the most,&#39;&#39; meaning it usually responds to competitors&#39; price changes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Toporek said, however, that the site also tried not to jostle shoppers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Clearly we are making changes, but it&#39;s not the kind of constant change you&#39;re seeing on some other sites,&#39;&#39; he said. An Amazon spokeswoman, Pia Arthur, declined to offer details on Amazon&#39;s pricing strategy, and said in an e-mail that the company was &#39;&#39;working hard to meet or beat the lowest prices out there.&#39;&#39; Target declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A retailer can increase its sales volume when it has the lowest prices, especially because it will appear prominently in price comparison tools. For the children&#39;s tablet LeapPad1 Explorer, for instance, Walmart appeared to be purposely undercutting Amazon, even if by a matter of pennies. When Amazon offered the tablet for $59.99 on the Monday before Thanksgiving, Walmart priced it at $59.97. On the Sunday after Thanksgiving, Amazon raised the price to $69.99, and Walmart followed, going to $69.97.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes a retailer cuts prices to tempt a competitor into offering a money-losing price and depleting its inventory. &#39;&#39;They&#39;ll wait until their competitor has sold out, and jump back into the game when the prices rise a little bit,&#39;&#39; said Ms. Schulz of Dynamite Data.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Target did not appear to shift prices nearly as frequently as Walmart and Amazon, it offered specials that spurred competitors into action. For a game called Telestrations, Walmart kept its price at $24.99 for the week. Amazon tried different prices, from $23.24 to $26.39, in the week before Thanksgiving, while Target held steady at $24.99. But when Target lowered the price to $18 on Black Friday, Amazon matched it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Decide.com, which offers consumers a tool suggesting when to buy, said that the retailers with the most volatile pricing included Buy.com, Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Sears. The most volatile product categories include games and consoles, printers, headphones, cameras, TVs and refrigerators.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dynamite Data also found that while many Amazon promotions over the weekend were at or near the lowest prices of the year, some were not that great -- even compared to Amazon itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Bodum wok, for instance, was priced at $119.95 before Thanksgiving, and Amazon offered a so-called lightning deal on Black Friday for $94.99. That seemed like a huge discount -- except that the same wok sold on Amazon for $59.99 just a few months ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some promoted discounts at Amazon, moreover, appeared steeper because the base price was increased before the Thanksgiving week markdown, Dynamite Data said. A Hewlett-Packard Envy notebook that cost $1,099.99 on Nov. 10, for example, was marked up to $1,179.97 by Nov. 20. That day, Amazon offered a limited-time deal at</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$849.99, a 28 percent discount from the marked-up price, but only 23 percent less than the Nov. 10 price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consumers seemed good at evaluating deals, though. Later that week, Amazon offered another deal on that Envy computer, at $1,049.99. According to Dynamite Data, the sell-through rate was much slower than at</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$849.99. &#39;&#39;Consumers are becoming more savvy shoppers,&#39;&#39; Ms. Schulz said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(A3) CHARTS: How Online Retailers Play With Pricing: The pricing firm Dynamite Data examined prices at Walmart.com, Amazon.com and Target.com from mid-November through the holiday weekend, and found fierce price competitiveness among retail rivals.

Google said this would make the listings better, because retailers would have an incentive to list up-to-date items.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But as a result, Google Shopping&#39;s listings are less comprehensive than they were before. For example, Amazon has so far refused to pay for listings, so a Google search for the Kindle does not show Amazon, which makes the Kindle, in shopping results.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://searchengineland.com/the-mess-that-is-google-shopping-139112" class="s1" target="_blank">On Search Engine Land, Danny Sullivan, a search industry expert, outlined in greater detail some of the service&#39;s recent weaknesses in a post called &quot;</a>The Mess That Is Google Shopping<span class="p">.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The lack of comprehensiveness means that Google risks losing shoppers to other comparison shopping sites or to Amazon, even as it tries to keep them. In a shift, more people now start product searches on Amazon instead of Google, according to Forrester data. That is a problem for Google for a few reasons, the biggest of which is that retail searches and search ads are among its biggest businesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google is trying to lure retailers by offering new features for its shopping search. They include 360-degree photos of items, starting with holiday toys. With Shortlists, people can save items they like and share lists with friends, and Google and retailers gain insight into what shoppers want to buy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google is also trying to attract shoppers with exclusive promotions that retailers can offer through the site. These also show up on mobile apps for Google Maps and Google Offers. And Google has expanded its product reviews. Google has long drawn product reviews from around the Web, but now people can write their own on Google and see reviews from people they know on Google Plus ranked at the top when they do a product search.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reviews have been one of Amazon&#39;s biggest selling points for shopping search because of the volume of shoppers there. This shopping season will provide some clues as to whether Google can lure back some of the shoppers who have turned to Amazon for search.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/google-is-offering-same-day-delivery-in-san-francisco/" class="a" target="_blank">Google Is Testing Same-Day Delivery for </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/google-is-offering-same-day-delivery-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank">Shoppers</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/e-book-sellers-face-a-battle-to-win-ipad-customers/" class="a" target="_blank">E-Book Sellers Face a Battle to Win iPad </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/e-book-sellers-face-a-battle-to-win-ipad-customers/" target="_blank">Customers</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/amazon-gives-price-checking-shoppers-a-bigger-discount/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Gives Price-Checking Shoppers a Bigger </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/amazon-gives-price-checking-shoppers-a-bigger-discount/" target="_blank">Discount</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/amazon-introduces-a-digital-music-locker/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Introduces a Digital Music </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/amazon-introduces-a-digital-music-locker/" target="_blank">Locker</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon to Open Android App Store as Apple Sues<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020121123e8bn001rz</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_093.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark180">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark181">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s Diminishing Discounts</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">753 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">22 November 2012 NYT Blogs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2012 The New York Times Company.

Books published by university presses are often available at a smaller discount than books from trade publishers. And yes, there are doubtless many popular books on Amazon at big discounts. But like many readers, I go to Amazon for the long tail -- little-known books that are unavailable in even the best-stocked bookshop.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The issue of pricing on Amazon matters for more than my pocketbook. The central question about the company has always been: How will it choose to make money? It has invested for the future for 18 years now, in the process demolishing much of the competition while giving it one of the priciest stocks on Wall Street. But at some point, somehow, it will have to become a normal business, which means selling things for more than it paid. One way to do that: erase discounts on books that readers cannot easily get anywhere else.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another possibility: Amazon is intentionally pricing its books higher so buyers will instead purchase from the cheaper third-party sellers, which are more profitable for Amazon. In other words, Amazon would rather run a mall or bazaar than try and be Wal-Mart.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In response to a query, Amazon said, rather generally, that it wasn&#39;t raising prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611453119/ref%3Dox_sc_sfl_title_10?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon executives say the price of a book falls as it sells faster, but the site has always seemed more mysterious than that. Here&#39;s one example of a book dropping so fast it seemed to be falling out of the sky, but I doubt it was because people were gobbling up copies. In July, Arcade published </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611453119/ref%3Dox_sc_sfl_title_10?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER" class="a" target="_blank">an omnibus of the works of the</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611453119/ref%3Dox_sc_sfl_title_10?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611453119/ref%3Dox_sc_sfl_title_10?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER" class="a" target="_blank">Nobel laureate Octavio Paz</a>. List price: $40. Over the rest of the summer and into the fall, the price tumbled. By Nov. 12, it was down to $1.32 -- a 97 percent drop. Mr. Paz is dead and out of fashion, so it seemed as if he was on a rather quick trip to the recycling bin. I finally took pity on the book and bought it. As a Prime member, I got it shipped for free.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The book arrived promptly but was damaged. So I complained, and Amazon of course said it would send another and refund my postage. Now presumably Amazon is still paying the standard rate to Arcade for the book -- about</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$18. (Arcade didn&#39;t get back to me.) Amazon&#39;s total revenue from me on this deal was $1.32. It had to send me the book twice and refund my return $3.99 shipping. Overall I&#39;d guess that Amazon lost about $30 on this transaction.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps because I bought a copy, the book didn&#39;t last at $1.32.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tim Ferriss, the author of the &quot;4-Hour&quot; series of self-help books for young men, hails from the nutritional supplements world, where the product is going to rot in the warehouse unless customers feel it is going to change their lives forever right now. Amazon, more than just about any other large tech company, does not pretend it sees any value in the old order.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bring these two elements together in the publication by Amazon of Mr. Ferriss&#39; new book, &quot;The 4-Hour Chef,&quot; and the result is a lot of noise, hype and anger, as well as some hints about the future of book publishing. Here are a few preliminary conclusions:</p><ol id="l3"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anything can be a bookstore. The official publication date is Tuesday, but don&#39;t look for the book in Barnes &amp; Noble or in many of the country&#39;s independent stores. They don&#39;t want to carry anything that will help the mighty Amazon extend its dominance. Instead, you could have seen the book Monday - even before it was officially on sale - in four Panera Bread outlets in Manhattan. Panera is doing a marketing deal with Mr. Ferriss. The book is also being promoted through the file-sharing site BitTorrent, which is typically used to pirate books rather than publicize them.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a book is published, the real work begins. In the old days, it certainly helped to be a good pitchman, but even if you were a rotten public speaker there were channels for promotion that did not involve your presence. Your publisher made a deal with Barnes &amp; Noble and then there were stacks of your latest in the front of its stores. If the independent stores were a fan, they would get an early copy and talk it up to customers. With those outlets denied to Mr. Ferriss, he is enthusiastically holding contests and offering deals. Buy 25 physical books and get a bunch of bonuses, including a Kindle Fire. Interested in buying 4,000 copies? He&#39;ll come speak at your conference. The author who does not hustle his book in similar ways will soon find himself on the virtual  remainder shelf.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/11/15/the-4-hour-chef-all-you-can-eat-campaign-of-goodness/" class="s1" target="_blank">If traditional publishing and traditional bookselling are going to survive, they are going to have to state their case in a way they never had to before.

(List price is $35.) A traditional publisher could not afford to do these things, especially after giving Mr. Ferriss a seven-figure advance. But then Amazon, to the chagrin of its competitors, has never needed to make money.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Everything will be a best seller, even if you have to give it away. Mr. Ferriss wants &quot;The 4-Hour Chef&quot; to be the first nonfiction book to sell a million copies on Kindle. My guess is that he and Amazon are willing to keep lowering the price until they get there. It is easy to see a set-up where only the most successful writers make much money. Everyone else will be giving their work away for free to establish an audience.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The first victim here is going to be the English language.<a href="http://blog.bittorrent.com/2012/11/16/the-4-hour-project/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://blog.bittorrent.com/2012/11/16/the-4-hour-project/" class="a" target="_blank">The BitTorrent post</a> announcing their deal with Mr. Ferriss would earn a flunking grade from a high school English teacher for lines like, &quot;We&#39;ll be distributing the</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/11/15/the-4-hour-chef-all-you-can-eat-campaign-of-goodness/" class="s1" target="_blank">writer&#39;s process: the photos, drafts, videos and recipes that shaped Tim&#39;s journey.&quot; And then there&#39;s the reference to &quot;Julia Childs.&quot; Mr. Ferriss himself seems to be getting so overwrought about selling his book that </a><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/11/15/the-4-hour-chef-all-you-can-eat-campaign-of-goodness/" class="a" target="_blank">he is writing</a><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/11/15/the-4-hour-chef-all-you-can-eat-campaign-of-goodness/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/11/15/the-4-hour-chef-all-you-can-eat-campaign-of-goodness/" class="a" target="_blank">sentences like,</a><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/11/15/the-4-hour-chef-all-you-can-eat-campaign-of-goodness/" class="s2" target="_blank"> </a>&quot;It&#39;s the Red Coats versus the colonies, and I must take attack using different means.&quot; Can&#39;t figure out which side he&#39;s on?

Amazon says it has received a bill from France for taxes and penalties related to the “allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions” from 2006 through 2010. Other companies, including Google, are also reportedly in the French authorities’ sights.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Even if the Internet is a zone of freedom, it shouldn’t be a lawless zone,” Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, a spokeswoman for the French government, said last week. “Fiscal rules should be able to be applied to those activities as well.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google, Amazon, Starbucks and other American companies facing tax scrutiny say they are doing nothing wrong. They use complex accounting strategies to exploit national differences across Europe in corporate tax rates, which range from less than 10 percent to more than 30 percent, and loopholes that can reduce their effective European tax levies to almost nothing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google, for example, records most of its international revenue at its European headquarters in Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is 12.5 percent. Across Europe, customers who buy advertising, Google’s primary source of revenue, sign contracts with the company’s subsidiary in Ireland, rather than with local branches.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google ends up paying Irish taxes on only a fraction of the billions of euros that course through its Dublin office. That is because the company uses a variety of methods, including royalty payments to a unit in Bermuda, to reduce further the amount of money exposed to tax liability.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So, while Google told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it generated more than $4 billion in sales in Britain last year, it reported revenue of only £396 million, or $629 million, in its official filings there. The total, the company said, reflected the amount that Google’s British unit billed Google Ireland for promotional work, consulting and other activities. Google declared a profit of £31 million in Britain, resulting in a British tax bill of only</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">£6 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We pay the tax we are required to pay in every country in which we operate,” Matt Brittin, Google vice president for North and Central Europe, told the parliamentary panel.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Hodge, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, acknowledged that she thought Google, Amazon and Starbucks were probably complying with the law. “We are not accusing you of being illegal, we are accusing you of being immoral,” she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In France, more than morality is at stake. In his testimony to the parliamentary panel, Andrew Cecil, director of public policy for Amazon in Europe, confirmed that the company had received a demand for $252 million from the</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">French tax collection agency. He said Amazon was contesting the claim, which was originally disclosed in an American regulatory filing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which has European headquarters in Luxembourg, another small country with favorable tax conditions for multinational companies, reported 9.1 billion euros, or $11.6 billion, in revenue across Europe last year. It posted an after-tax profit of 20 million euros on those sales, and paid about 8 million euros in tax, Mr. Cecil said.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://Amazon.co.uk/" class="s1" target="_blank">Mr. Cecil told the parliamentary committee that when customers across Europe bought books from Amazon, they were actually buying them from the Luxembourg-based Amazon entity, rather than their local subsidiaries. That response was met with incredulity by Ms. Hodge, who noted that when she ordered a book from the company, she used a British Web site, </a>Amazon.co.uk<span class="p">, and the goods were delivered from a British warehouse via the British Royal Mail.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">News reports in France note that French fiscal authorities are also seeking back taxes and penalties from Google, amounting to 1.7 billion euros. Ms. Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters that she could not comment on individual companies for privacy reasons. Google, in a statement, said the reports were premature.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Google has not received any tax assessment from the French tax administration,” the company said. “We have and will continue to cooperate with the authorities in France.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Europe is not the only place where the complex tax arrangements of United States multinationals are being questioned. The authorities in Australia have sent Apple a bill for 28.5 million Australian dollars, or about $29.5 million, in back taxes, according to news reports Friday. Apple could not be reached for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In an era of globalization, determining the tax liability of multinational companies has long vexed policy makers and tax collectors. International agreements generally state that commerce should be taxed in the physical location where profit-making activity occurs, not necessarily where a customer is based or where a transaction takes place.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Determining the appropriate jurisdiction for taxation is especially difficult with Internet businesses, because of the intangible nature of many of the goods and services that change hands and the ease with which transactions can cross borders.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google says that most of the economic value it creates is generated in Silicon Valley, where its engineers toil away at the computer algorithms behind its search engine and other services. So the company says it is fair that most of what it pays in taxes goes to the United States Treasury, not its foreign counterparts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Google’s United States taxes have come under scrutiny, too, the company pays substantially more in the United States. In 2011, the company’s annual report shows, it made a provision of $2.6 billion for income taxes, all but $248 million of that going to the state and national treasuries in the United States. Based on pretax income of $12.3 billion, that amounted to an effective rate of 21 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“If Google was a British business, if Google had been founded in Cambridge by Larry and Sergey, I think we’d be in a very different place here, because the profitability would rightly sit where all the technology and innovation take place, which is not here,” Mr. Brittin said. He was referring to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though Google employees across Europe advise clients on the use of the company’s services, advertisers sign contracts with the company’s subsidiary in Ireland. This has shielded Google from tax liability in France, Britain and other European countries, at least so far.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Google is saying, ‘We just float around freely above this useful aircraft carrier, Ireland,’ ” said Richard Murphy, founder of the Tax Justice Network, an independent organization that campaigns against what it calls tax “loopholes and distortions.” “What France is saying is, ‘We don’t think you float around over Ireland, we think you are in France.’ ”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Google believes that its profit-making activity — that is, its taxable work — occurs in the United States, Mr. Murphy said, then it ought to take its European earnings home and expose them to the Internal Revenue Service. Yet, like many other American multinationals, it has been reluctant to do so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instead, Google said it had accumulated $24.8 billion as of the end of 2011 outside the United States — part of a cache of stored American corporate cash that Citizens for Tax Justice, an American advocacy group, estimates at more than $1.5 trillion. The money has been accumulating in Bermuda and other offshore havens since a 2004 United States tax holiday for the repatriation of corporate profits.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While some American corporate leaders have been lobbying in Washington for another tax holiday, lawmakers in Europe are moving to collect a greater share of multinationals’ taxes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last spring, the European Parliament threw its support behind a proposal to create a single set of European Union-wide accounting rules for calculating multinational corporations’ tax liabilities. But policy makers are divided over whether the standards should be voluntary or mandatory.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Vallaud-Belkacem said last week that the administration of President François Hollande of France was discussing with other European governments ways to crack down on tax avoidance by international companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After a meeting this month, George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble of Germany called for “concerted international cooperation to strengthen international standards for corporate tax regimes.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Osborne said in a statement, “We want competitive taxes that say Britain is open for business and that attract global companies to invest in and bring jobs to our country, but we also want global companies to pay those taxes.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020121118e8bj002gx</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_096.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark186">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</a><a name="bookmark187">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">The Tablet Market Grows Cluttered</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER and BRIAN X.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Holiday shoppers with a tablet computer on their gift list this year might be forgiven for feeling a little panicked.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Look at the tablets available online or at a consumer electronics store and it can be dizzying to choose from among the dozens of slim rectangles with touch screens -- each with various sizes, features, prices and applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tablets were supposed to be a simple alternative to the bloated personal computer market. And when &#39;&#39;tablet&#39;&#39; was synonymous with &#39;&#39;iPad,&#39;&#39; that was true.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But this is the first holiday season in which the iPad faces competitors that have built up a solid footing in the market. Amazon and Google introduced tablets just in time for the shopping rush. As a result, many consumers and analysts say, the new market of keyboardless computers is quickly becoming as confusing as that of the old-school PC.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;What&#39;s different about this holiday season is that consumers have not just more choice, but really good choices,&#39;&#39; said Sarah Rotman Epps, who studies consumer computing trends at Forrester. &#39;&#39;There have been many iPad wannabes but no real quality alternatives, and now there are several.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While choice is a good thing for consumers, she said, it also makes shopping &#39;&#39;confusing and complicated.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For the companies that make tablets, the choice means everything. The stakes are much higher than the sale of individual devices. Each company is trying to snag lifelong customers for their other products -- like music, apps, e-books, movies, Web search or word-processing software.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While Apple has dominated the market until now, selling more tablets than any other company, its perch is being threatened by the newcomers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Apple left a lot of room for rivals to grow,&#39;&#39; said Tero Kuittinen, an independent mobile analyst.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By keeping its tablet prices so high, he said, Apple could lose its place as the biggest tablet seller, just as it did with smartphones when it lost the first-place position to Samsung, which makes less expensive phones using Google&#39;s Android software. The iPad still dominates the market with a 50 percent share, according to third-quarter figures from the research firm IDC, but that is down from 60 percent a year ago. Samsung is in second place with an 18 percent share, Amazon is third with 9 percent, and Asus, which makes Google&#39;s Nexus 7 tablet, is in fourth with 8.6 percent of the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Google, which makes the vast majority of its revenue on Web ads, still lags in the tablet market, even though sales of its Nexus 7 tablet are approaching one million a month, according to Asus. About 98 percent of Web traffic from tablets comes from iPads, according to Onswipe, a digital publishing company. Google would like more of that traffic, as well as more buyers for apps and media from its Google Play store, as would Amazon and Microsoft.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The first decision you make is what ecosystem am I in, do I want the Android Play store and content or some other?&#39;&#39; said Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google&#39;s vice president for engineering for Android. &#39;&#39;So the importance of the ecosystem can&#39;t be overstated.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the decisions after that are still complex.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Say, for example, that you want a tablet that runs Google&#39;s Android operating system. There is the Nexus 7, a seven-inch tablet made by Asus, and the Nexus 10, a 10-inch tablet made by Samsung. Then there are the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (not to be confused with the Samsung Galaxy Note 2, a 5.5-inch smartphone). And that&#39;s not to mention the dozens of Android tablets made by Lenovo, Toshiba and others.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This year, Microsoft also has a tablet, called Surface. Amazon has the Kindle Fire and Fire HD, and Barnes &amp; Noble has the Nook HD and HD+. Once shoppers choose one, they have more choices to make, like whether they want to pay $15 more for the privilege of not seeing ads on the Kindle Fire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even Apple, which has always prided itself on having simple product lines, now offers the new iPad, the older iPad 2 and the iPad Mini. If you factor in the various amounts of storage and the choice of cellular data or just Wi-Fi, there are essentially 14 iPad models to choose from.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Complicating the decision on hardware, different tablets connect to different online stores for apps, music and video. If you have built your music and app collection on Apple devices, an Android tablet may mean starting from scratch, and vice versa.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The proliferation of products is nothing new for a mature market, as anyone who has stood in front of a wall of televisions at Best Buy or in a parking lot of Priuses at a Toyota dealership knows.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But some consumer electronics companies that have given their customers too many options have run into trouble, said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee. They include Motorola Mobility, which is trying to rescue its cellphone business by paring its lineup of 27 devices, and Research in Motion, which offers a perplexing matrix of BlackBerrys with confusing names, like the BlackBerry Torch 9810, 9850 and 9860.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google in particular runs this risk, said Michael Gartenberg, a technology analyst at Gartner, because it gives away its Android operating system to any device manufacturer that wants to use it, resulting in an uncontrolled array of Android devices running different versions of the software. Some apps will work only with particular versions, making it difficult to know exactly what you are getting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google has tried to address this problem in recent months. It gave its line of Nexus products names corresponding to their screen size and began selling them in its Play store. (Google teams up with manufacturers to build the Nexus devices.) It began running ads for the tablets online, on billboards, in print and on television, which had been rare for the company, and assigned a public relations employee to focus on selling hardware to consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think the added choice is adding complexity,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Lockheimer of Google. &#39;&#39;If you want to do the research, you can do it, but if you don&#39;t want to, you can just ignore all that and get the thing your friend or family member recommended.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For shoppers inclined to do the research, many Web sites and apps, including those from CNet, Retrevo, Decide.com and Consumer Reports, can help.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Even those of us who eat and breathe tech, we&#39;re still confused,&#39;&#39; said Lawrence Fong, co-founder of BuyVia, a shopping app that compares products, including tablets. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s why we&#39;re explaining each product in plain English.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The default choice for shoppers, Ms. Rotman Epps said, is often an iPad. &#39;&#39;It is a road-tested product, it comes with the Apple quality halo around Apple&#39;s brand, and it&#39;s leagues ahead in terms of the apps available for it,&#39;&#39; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But iPads are more expensive than other tablets. They range from $330 for the least expensive iPad Mini to $830 for a 64-gigabyte iPad with cellular data and Wi-Fi.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google and Amazon advertise their tablets as offering the best value. The Nexus 7 starts at $200 and the Kindle Fire starts around $160.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Microsoft says the Surface, which starts at $500, is better for getting work done, because you can hook up a mouse, type more easily with an add-on keyboard and cover, and use some Office applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the bold design of Microsoft&#39;s new tablet software and hardware could be too confusing for Windows users, who tend to be less tech-savvy, Ms. Rotman Epps said. &#39;&#39;Given the profile of who wants to buy a Windows tablet, complexity is not a good thing,&#39;&#39; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For many people, the biggest factor to consider when choosing a tablet is where it takes them once they turn it on</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- that is, which services, apps and stores selling books and music they can use.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We&#39;ve been in love with the glass,&#39;&#39; said Mark Curtis, chief client officer at Fjord, a mobile design firm. &#39;&#39;Now we&#39;re going to fall in love with what&#39;s behind the glass. It&#39;s about the services they can offer.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And, as often happens when a market matures and becomes saturated, companies are beginning to look beyond tablets to the next generation of devices, which might be worn on people&#39;s bodies or installed in their homes, Mr. Curtis said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you think this year&#39;s holiday shopping list is complicated, wait until next year, when it might include Internet-connected watches, eyeglasses or coffee pots.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple introduced a smaller iPad, the iPad Mini, left, in October.

At least that was my thought when Random House and Penguin, two of the world’s six largest publishers, </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/business/global/random-house-and-penguin-to-be-combined.html" class="a" target="_blank">announced that they were coming together</a> <span style=" color: #000;">last month. Ever since Amazon began ripping apart the book business, the largest houses have been looking for a way to fight back. If this merger is any indication, they have chosen an old-fashioned strategy: Size.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A combined Penguin-Random House, which would control a quarter of the global book market, is a conglomerate designed to take on another giant, though it’s not exactly a fair fight. Because the new entity will only have about a twelfth of Amazon’s annual sales, most observers expect that this is just the beginning of a series of mergers — like those in the music business — that will take the Big Six publishers down to the Big Three and perhaps one day even the Big One. As John Makinson, Penguin’s chief executive, told The Times, “We decided it was better to get in early rather than be a follower.” The question is whether this strategy will work.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are two competing predictions about commerce in the digital age. One is that companies will get smaller and more disruptive as nimble entrepreneurs can take on giant corporations with little more than 3-D printers and Web sites. The other envisions a few massive companies — like Procter &amp; Gamble, Apple and Nike — that design everything themselves, have it manufactured cheaply in Asia and use their e-commerce sites to gather information about their customers. Nearly the exact same conflict occurred more than a century ago in the decade that straddled 1900, which was also a period of rapid technological change. In just a few years, 1,800 small companies were swallowed up as the electrical-power, telephone, auto, steel and chemical industries grew from patchworks of tiny companies into conglomerates. In “The Great Merger Movement in American Business</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1895-1904,” the Yale economist and historian Naomi Lamoreaux wrote that back then everyone worried about the same thing that authors, editors and book buyers worry about now: Are large companies good for the economy? Do they grow through efficiency and innovation or by abusing their leverage?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lamoreaux found that they did both, and many turn-of-the-century examples suggest what might happen to Penguin-Random and others. On one end of the spectrum, Lamoreaux told me, was U.S. Steel. Its predecessor companies competed by finding new ways of making steel at ever-lower prices. But after J. P. Morgan merged three companies into one behemoth, he discovered a better way to profit. Because all steel producers bought iron ore from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota, U.S. Steel bought most of the range and locked much of the rest of it in long-term contracts. As a result, the company hardly worried about competition; it had little need to innovate or compete on price, which made everything from cars to soda cans more expensive. Worse, it left a massive industry unprepared for the growth of innovative Asian companies during the 1970s and 1980s. By then, U.S. Steel all but collapsed, and a chunk of the U.S. economy went down with it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sears &amp; Roebuck, on the other end, “grew by solving market and technical problems,” Lamoreaux said, and, as it solved them, its market share increased. Unable to monopolize anything like iron ore, Sears needed to innovate to stay ahead. Through constant competition with Montgomery Ward and others, it adopted new strategies that ultimately benefited its customers. When the company got into trouble, closed stores and was bought in 2005 by a struggling competitor, Kmart, the retail industry was robust enough that the overall economy barely noticed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The future of book publishing is somewhere between the two poles. Oddly enough, it seems to mirror what happened to the envelope business. In the early 1900s the envelope industry was large enough to support several big companies. Then the mergers started, and an industry of numerous small companies became two giants. Eventually, the envelope industry wasn’t large enough to sustain itself, and the companies became tiny divisions of larger conglomerates. U.S. Envelope still lives as a small part of the packaging manufacturer</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MeadWestvaco. American Envelope was bought by Cenveo, a business-stationery company whose chief executive, Robert G. Burton Sr., made clear that the century of mergers and buyouts is not over. “We’ve had people knocking on the door,” he told shareholders in August.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This kind of consolidation started in publishing long before the Penguin-Random merger. Random House, an arm of the media company Bertelsmann in Germany, is itself made up of former independents like Knopf and Pantheon. Penguin, a division of the education publisher Pearson, contains Dutton, Viking and others. If market forces were the only concern, it’s possible that there would soon be only one or two publishers and that they might be folded into some larger infotainment company like Time Warner Penguin or maybe Random Viacom.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There would still be books — just not large book companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every analysis I’ve read of the Penguin-Random House merger mentions the inevitable scrutiny of the antitrust lawyers at the Department of Justice, who are eager to prevent any potential monopoly in publishing. But it’s difficult to imagine how, in the digital world, publishers could ever monopolize the sale of written material. Even if there were only one house left, it would compete with every blogger and self-published e-book author. Eventually, it’s likely that book publishing will embody both conflicting visions of digital-age commerce — lots of small businesses and a few massive ones that handle big-ticket items.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History suggests that the antitrust lawyers should be more concerned about government-issued patents, which allow large corporations to buy up vaguely worded deeds that can be used to sue upstarts out of existence. This is the iron ore of the digital age and many large companies are gobbling up as many patents as they can. Reuters recently reported that Amazon (which somehow holds a patent for the “one-click shopping” button) was hiring several high-profile patent lawyers with the mandate to “identify and evaluate strategic I.P. acquisition and licensing opportunities.” The company has argued that it buys up patents to defend against the lawsuits of others. That may be partly true, but the worst fate for readers isn’t the merger of a few struggling companies in a diminishing business. It’s the threat of another U.S. Steel.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Deep thoughts this week:</p><ol id="l4"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Book publishing is turning to mergers out of desperation.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Will it work?</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">The answer may lie in the envelope industry, which survived by disappearing.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR’s “Planet Money,” a podcast and blog.

The Web application -- viewable on smartphones or tablets -- showed the location of field workers, neighborhoods to be canvassed, and blocks where help was needed. &quot;It allowed people to join a neighborhood team without ever going to a central office,&quot; said Mr. Slaby.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another ground-game program was a tool for telephone canvassing from people&#39;s homes instead of having to travel to a campaign office and work from a telephone bank. The call tool was a Web program that let people sign up to make calls and receive a list of phone numbers, names and a script to use, noted Mr. Reed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3gPZex8EWI" class="s1" target="_blank">Often, the profiles of volunteer callers and the lists they received were matched. So the callers were people with similar life experiences to those being called, and thus more likely to be persuasive.

But this year, there were ten times as many, Mr. Slaby said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The sheer scale of the online outreach and data collection dwarfed the effort four years ago. For example, the Barack ObamaFacebook site had 33 million &quot;likes,&quot; compared with 2 million for the previous campaign. A Facebook like, Mr. Slaby noted, is the &quot;just the first rung on a ladder of engagement&quot; but it is a starting point.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another truly important change was in the technology itself. &quot;Cloud computing barely existed in 2008,&quot; Mr. Slaby said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This time, the Obama campaign&#39;s data center was mainly Amazon Web Services, the leading supplier of cloud services. The campaign&#39;s engineers built about 200 different programs that ran on the Amazon service including Dashboard, the remote calling tool, the campaign Web site, donation processing and data analytics applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using mainly open-source software and the Amazon service, the Obama campaign could inexpensively write and tailor its own programs instead of using off-the-shelf commercial software.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It let us attack and engineer our own approach to problems, and build solutions for an environment that moves so rapidly you can&#39;t plan,&quot; Mr. Slaby said. &quot;It made a huge difference this time.&quot;</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/supercomputing-rented-by-the-hour/" class="a" target="_blank">Supercomputing Rented by the </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/supercomputing-rented-by-the-hour/" target="_blank">Hour</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/amazon-cloud-failure-takes-down-web-sites/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Cloud Failure Takes Down Web </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/amazon-cloud-failure-takes-down-web-sites/" target="_blank">Sites</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/a-big-data-road-map-for-government/" class="a" target="_blank">A Big Data Road Map for </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/a-big-data-road-map-for-government/" target="_blank">Government</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/cloud-computing-for-the-poorest-countries/" class="a" target="_blank">Cloud Computing for the Poorest </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/cloud-computing-for-the-poorest-countries/" target="_blank">Countries</a></p></li><li><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">President Obama Takes Questions From the Internet on Reddit<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020121109e8b80002t</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 12-13 2/Image_099.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark192">Gadgetwise</a><a name="bookmark193">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Technology; Personal Tech</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Q&amp;A: The Many Flavors of Android</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By J.D.

The Kindle&#39;s version of Android does not run as many apps as Google&#39;s Nexus 7 with its unmodified Android system, but it supports the common ones: Twitter, Facebook, Pandora, Angry Birds and other popular pastimes. (While it is possible to manually install Android apps from other sources on the Kindle, many people just stick with the apps available for download right on the device.)</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps" class="s1" target="_blank">The Google Nexus 7 is geared more to app lovers and people who like to tinker with tablets; a larger Nexus 10 is also available.

This fall, signs of Amazon-inspired disruption are everywhere.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There is the slow-motion crackup of electronics showroom Best Buy. There is Amazon’s rumored entry into the wine business, which is already agitating competitors. And there is the merger of Random House and Penguin, an effort to create a mega-publisher sufficiently hefty to negotiate with the retailer on equal terms.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon inspires anxiety just about everywhere, but its publishing arm is getting pushback from all sorts of booksellers, who are scorning the imprint’s most prominent title, Timothy Ferriss’s “The 4-Hour Chef.” That book is coming out just before Thanksgiving into a fragmented book-selling landscape that Amazon has done much to create but that eludes its control.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ferriss’s first book, “The 4-Hour Workweek,” sold nearly a half-million copies in its original print edition, according to Nielsen BookScan. A follow-up devoted to the body did nearly as well. Those books about finding success without trying too hard were a particular hit with young men, who identified with their quasi-scientific entrepreneurial spirit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Signing Mr. Ferriss was seen as a smart choice by Amazon, which wanted books that would make a splash in both the digital and physical worlds. When the seven-figure deal was announced in August 2011, Mr. Ferriss, a former nutritional supplements marketer, said this was “a chance to really show what the future of books looks like.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that publication is at hand, that future looks messy and angry. Barnes &amp; Noble, struggling to remain relevant in Amazon’s shadow, has been emphatic that it will not carry its competitor’s books. Other large physical and digital stores seem to be uninterested or even opposed to the book. Many independent stores feel betrayed by Mr. Ferriss, whom they had championed. They will do nothing to help him if it involves helping a company they feel is hellbent on their destruction.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“At a certain point you have to decide how far you want to nail your own coffin shut,” said Michael Tucker, owner of the Books Inc. chain here. “Amazon wants to completely control the entire book trade. You’re crazy if you want to play that game with them.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bill Petrocelli, co-owner of Book Passage, a large store in suburban Marin County, expressed similar reservations. “We don’t think it’s in our best interests to do business with Amazon,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Crown, a division of Random House, took on Mr. Ferriss in 2007, after more than two dozen publishers said no to him. “Crown put in a lot of effort to promote those books,” Mr. Petrocelli said. “He decided to walk away. That’s his decision to make but I can’t say I applaud it. I think writers should be supportive of publishers that are supportive of them.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This isn’t a full-fledged boycott. Books Inc. and Book Passage said they would special order “The 4-Hour Chef” for anyone who wanted one. And some independent stores will even display it, if not enthusiastically.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Green Apple, another big independent San Francisco store, said it would stock the book, figuring that if there was money to be made on its sale, better Green Apple make it than Amazon. But Kevin Ryan, the store’s buyer, said there were limits. “We’re not going to go out of our way to promote something from Amazon,” he said. “We’re not going to stretch.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Mr. Ferriss signed with Amazon, he celebrated the new at the expense of the old. “I don’t feel like I’m giving up anything, financially or otherwise,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He has a somewhat different view these days. “By signing with Amazon, I expected this type of blowback,” he said. “I’ve been girding my loins.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The irony, he added, is that the $35 book was meant to be inviting to the casual browser. Amazon can do many things, but it still cannot let readers examine a book before buying. “This is the kind of book that physical booksellers would be most excited to sell,” Mr. Ferriss said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Only a few years ago, culture was delivered in discrete doses. “The 4-Hour Chef” would have been in the chain bookstores by the stacks and in independents by the handful. You wanted a book, you went to the bookstore. Simple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Now the technology overlords — Amazon, Google and Apple — are competing among themselves and with other players to control how the culture is consumed. Amazon’s Kindle Fire was introduced last year to carve out some space from Apple’s iPad; since then, Google and Microsoft have brought out their own tablets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There is constant jockeying for position. Amazon, for instance, is at odds with Wal-Mart and Target, both of which have stopped selling the Kindle, worried that it is a Trojan horse that will lure their customers away.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All the technology companies hope to bind users to their devices as tablet use explodes. There are about 70,000 activations every day of tablets powered by Google’s Android software. That is a vast number of potential readers, but Google Play, a media store for these devices, does not offer the big books Amazon published this fall. It does, however, offer downloads of a popular book Amazon published several years ago, “The Hangman’s Daughter.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Google spokeswoman referred calls to Amazon. “We’re going to decline to participate,” an Amazon spokeswoman said.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://Walmart.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">Wal-Mart, asked if it would be selling “The 4-Hour Chef,” said only that it would be offered online through </a>Walmart.com<span class="p">. Target said it isn’t carrying the book, although it is carrying both online and in stores other new cookbooks published by the traditional presses, like Lidia Matticchio Bastianich’s “Lidia’s Favorite Recipes.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has been publishing books since 2009. Most of its imprints are run out of its Seattle offices, including lines for mysteries and romances. Authors who write for these imprints say they are doing well, sometimes extremely well. Their sales are largely digital. They live within the Amazon ecosystem, selling their books from the retailer’s Web site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For the moment, though, a book that aspires to be a genuine national best seller needs more than that. And that is where the books being acquired by Amazon in New York, which are distributed to the book trade by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt under the New Harvest imprint, are faltering.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Its editors, led by a longtime publishing operative, Laurence Kirshbaum, seem to have backed off, at least for the time being, from buying prominent books.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/complete_coverage/harry_potter/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" class="s1" target="_blank">“I had expected more,” said Sucharita Mulpuru, a Forrester technology analyst. “I expected them to find the next ‘Hunger Games.’ I expected the next </a><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/complete_coverage/harry_potter/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" class="a" target="_blank">Harry Potter</a> <span style=" color: #000;">to come through Amazon. They have not changed the world like many assumed they would.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In September, Amazon published the movie director Penny Marshall’s “My Mother Was Nuts.” According to Nielsen BookScan, it has sold 8,000 hardcover copies. “That should have sold 50,000, but they couldn’t go through the brick and mortar stores,” said Mr. Tucker of Books Inc. He declined to sell that one too, and so apparently did just about everyone that wasn’t Amazon. Ms. Marshall’s agent did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As publication approaches, Mr. Ferriss has started aggressively promoting “The 4-Hour Chef” on his blog, announcing a weight-loss contest.

Its title: &quot;Does Mitt Romney&#39;s Mormonism make him too scary or weird to be elected to president of the United States?&quot; Mr. Beck&#39;s answer at the end: &quot;It&#39;s not weird to be a Mormon, and it&#39;s not weird to be president if you&#39;re Mormon.&quot;</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/05/business/media/google-news-faces-challenges-from-publishers-abroad.html?ref=business&amp;pagewanted=all" class="s1" target="_blank">While American newspapers have come to accept the way Google News operates - creating a page of headlines and summaries (as well as links) to articles created by news publications - the fight from publishers overseas continues, </a>David Carr writes<span class="p">.

They are scorning the imprint&#39;s most prominent title, Timothy Ferriss&#39;s &quot;The 4-Hour Chef.&quot; That book is coming out just before Thanksgiving into a fragmented book-selling landscape that Amazon has done much to create but that eludes its control.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ferriss&#39;s first book, &quot;The 4-Hour Workweek,&quot; sold nearly a half-million copies in its original print edition, according to Nielsen BookScan. A follow-up devoted to the body did nearly as well. Those books about finding success without trying too hard were a particular hit with young men, who identified with their quasi-scientific entrepreneurial spirit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Signing Mr. Ferriss was seen as a smart choice by Amazon, which wanted books that would make a splash in both the digital and physical worlds. When the seven-figure deal was announced in August 2011, Mr. Ferriss, a former nutritional supplements marketer, said this was &quot;a chance to really show what the future of books looks like.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that publication is at hand, that future looks messy and angry. Barnes &amp; Noble, struggling to remain relevant in Amazon&#39;s shadow, has been emphatic that it will not carry its competitor&#39;s books. Other large physical and digital stores seem to be uninterested or even opposed to the book. Many independent stores feel betrayed by Mr. Ferriss, whom they had championed. They will do nothing to help him if it involves helping a company they feel is hellbent on their destruction.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;At a certain point you have to decide how far you want to nail your own coffin shut,&quot; said Michael Tucker, owner of the Books Inc. chain in San Francisco. &quot;Amazon wants to completely control the entire book trade.
