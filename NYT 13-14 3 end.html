If I use Amazon Locker for a delivery, how long do I have to pick up my order?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Amazon Locker, a shipping destination you can select to store your package in a nearby, secure bin, will hold your order for three business days after you receive a pickup code by text or email. If all the Amazon Lockers are full when the courier tries to deposit your package, you should get a message that the delivery was unsuccessful</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- and that another attempt will be made the next business day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For those who live in situations where package delivery often results in a collection of missed-attempt door tags, Amazon Locker can serve as a useful alternative. To use it, you need to log into your Amazon account and search your local area for any nearby locker locations. If you find one, add it to your Amazon address book so you can select it as a shipping destination. (Amazon Lockers tend to be big yellow cabinets found in grocery stores, pharmacies and convenience shops.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When your package is delivered to your locker location, Amazon sends you a text or email message with a pickup code. Once you enter the code on the locker&#39;s keyboard, the compartment with your package should pop open so you can collect your goods. For security reasons, a different pickup code is sent with each order.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The service is free to use, but not every item Amazon lists can be delivered to a locker. Textbook rentals, &#39;&#39;Subscribe and Save&#39;&#39; offers or merchandise not directly sold or fulfilled by Amazon are among the orders that do not qualify for locker delivery. Some objects are too big to fit in an Amazon Locker, so make sure the item you ordered weighs less than 10 pounds and is smaller than 16.5 inches by 13.8 inches by 12.6 inches.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A New Home for Old Picasa Web Albums</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q. I just signed up for a Google Plus page and noticed all the pictures in my old Picasa Web Albums collection got moved to the Photos menu in Google Plus. Is Picasa Web Albums getting phased out?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. For those who have accounts on its social network, Google began to redirect Picasa Web Album URLs more than a year ago, which is why your old Picasa Web Albums are now visible on the Photos area of your Google Plus page. For the time being, anyway, you can still go back to your old Picasa page by using the alternate address of<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/myphotos?noredirect=1" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/myphotos?noredirect=1" class="a" target="_blank">https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/myphotos?noredirect=1</a> .</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the past few years, Google has discontinued various Picasa-related programs and uploading utilities, along with the Linux version of the desktop program. These developments are most likely a signal that Picasa Web is fading and Google Plus Photos will get most of the company&#39;s attention for online sharing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Picasa desktop software is still available to download for Windows and Mac OS systems. Version 3.9 of the program includes new filters and visual effects, better face-tagging support and side-by-side editing. If you use Google Plus and its Circles system, the uploading box in the Picasa software does make it fairly simple to share content with specific groups of friends. Picasa users without Google Plus accounts can still share photos through the Web Albums site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020140314ea3e0003d</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_005.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4">Technology</a><a name="bookmark5">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Complaints As Amazon Raises Cost Of Prime</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">976 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14 March 2014 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">SAN FRANCISCO — People like getting their toys fast. They also like getting them cheap. Amazon is gambling they care more about the first than the second.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The retailer told the 25 million members of its Amazon Prime program on Thursday that it was increasing the annual fee for the two-day shipping service by 25 percent, to $99. The new price takes effect on the renewal dates for existing customers, starting April 17.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/01/week-amazon-insider-feature-treatment-employees-work" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon is famous for squeezing its suppliers for a better deal. Working in one of its warehouses, according to numerous </a>investigative reports<span class="p">, echoes “Les Misérables.” But the company is extremely solicitous of its customers, and takes care not to undermine their view that the retailer is at their service. That is why Amazon held the line on Prime for the first nine years of its existence.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What consumers want to know, however, is what a retailer is doing for them right now. After the fee increase was announced, the notion of a benevolent Amazon took a beating on the retailer’s discussion forums.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/forum/amazon%20prime/ref%3Dcm_cd_tfp_ef_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx19TKUDUCVHDNP&amp;cdThread=Tx1ZUSJUCVYOLHL" class="s1" target="_blank">“I have been a Prime member for many years and will not be bullied into paying more!!!” </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/forum/amazon%20prime/ref%3Dcm_cd_tfp_ef_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx19TKUDUCVHDNP&amp;cdThread=Tx1ZUSJUCVYOLHL" class="a" target="_blank">wrote one overwrought</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/forum/amazon%20prime/ref%3Dcm_cd_tfp_ef_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx19TKUDUCVHDNP&amp;cdThread=Tx1ZUSJUCVYOLHL" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/forum/amazon%20prime/ref%3Dcm_cd_tfp_ef_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx19TKUDUCVHDNP&amp;cdThread=Tx1ZUSJUCVYOLHL" class="a" target="_blank">fellow</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/forum/amazon%20prime/ref%3Dcm_cd_tfp_ef_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx19TKUDUCVHDNP&amp;cdThread=Tx1ZUSJUCVYOLHL" class="s1" target="_blank">. “This is RIDICULOUS!!!!!”</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Others more coolly pointed out that they were now paying tax on their Amazon purchases as well as on the Prime fee itself. They said they did not watch the 40,000 movies and TV shows that came bundled with Prime membership. And they said the two-day shipping sometimes ended up taking more time, and in that case why not use the standard shipping option — completely free for those who hit a $35 minimum?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It was fun while it lasted,” another soon-to-be-former user concluded.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investors, however, applauded the news. On a day when markets fell sharply, shares in Amazon held steady. Wall Street clearly believes Amazon can improve its shipping margins, helping the fragile bottom line without letting the revenue miss a step.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maybe not, said Hayley Silver of Bizrate Insights, an e-commerce consultant.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Raising prices in retail is a really hard thing to do,” she said. “This fee increase makes Amazon a little more vulnerable. But whether any competitor can step up to the plate is another story.”</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.shoprunner.com/amazon-prime/" class="s1" target="_blank">At least one competitor quickly moved to secure some Amazon customers. ShopRunner, a network of retailers from Neiman Marcus to PetSmart that offers two-day shipping, </a><a href="https://www.shoprunner.com/amazon-prime/" class="a" target="_blank">said it would waive its fees</a> <span style=" color: #000;">for Amazon Prime members for a year. ShopRunner usually costs $79.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“People are a little upset with Amazon,” said Fiona Dias, ShopRunner’s chief strategy officer. “We hope a lot upset.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon blamed rising costs of fuel and transportation for the increase in the Prime fee, but Ms. Dias said the real problem was the cost to Amazon of all the content that it includes with Prime membership. Amazon has now moved into original programming, part of its continuing competition with Netflix.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Amazon is passing on the cost of video to a bunch of people addicted to buying online,” Ms. Dias said. “Maybe it sticks in their craw that they’re now being asked to pay more for stuff they don’t want.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prime members also get to borrow one free e-book a month from a lending library, but only if they have a Kindle. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is a mega-retailer, soon to hit $100 billion in revenue with 237 million active customers. It has completely reworked people’s experience with books, and is trying to do the same with other forms of entertainment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Land-based competitors from Sears to Staples are culling stores in a way they would not if Amazon did not exist. The company’s ambition is boundless.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet it is never clear how solid its achievement is. Amazon might have rewritten many of the rules for retail but at the end of the day it will still have to make a profit while pleasing customers. It certainly does the latter, but tends to skimp on the former.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“This is a rational business move but atypical, because they usually seem to hate raising prices until necessary,” said Sucharita Mulpuru, a Forrester Research analyst. “I suspect the people they lose will be offset by some people paying more, some more wallet share in categories like grocery and a bunch of people forgetting to cancel.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Mulpuru added, “Amazon is trying to figure out how to better manage shipping costs and it is coming at the expense of service.” She, like some of those on the Amazon forum, complained of slow Prime shipping.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which said in January it was considering raising the fee for Prime by as much as 50 percent, does not release any data it does not have to, so analyst estimates that there are 25 million Prime members are only a reasonable guess. Some are trial members or students, who pay much less.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts at Piper Jaffray surveyed 500 current Prime subscribers in the United States, asking them how likely they would be to renew if the fee went to $109. Two-thirds said no, but the analysts did not believe them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Psychologically no one wants to pay more for something,” wrote Gene Munster, one of the analysts, in a Thursday report. He estimated that a quarter of the Prime base was highly sensitive and might rebel. That might cut $800 million, or about 1 percent, from Amazon’s revenue. On the other hand the increased fee from more easygoing customers would add $150 million to the bottom line, which for Amazon would be a lot.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/technology/amazons-shares-fall-as-revenue-disappoints.html" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/technology/amazons-shares-fall-as-revenue-disappoints.html" target="_blank">Amazon to Raise Fees as Revenue Disappoints</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the first time since it was introduced in 2005, the price of Prime is going up, Amazon said. | Paul Sakuma/Associated Press</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020140313ea3e0035y</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_006.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark6">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</a><a name="bookmark7">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">A Firm Thrives Building Global Copycats of the Tech Industry&#39;s Hits</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MARK SCOTT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,408 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3 March 2014</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 7</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.

For Easy Taxi, think Uber for Nigerians.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And for all of them, think Rocket Internet, a budding tech empire here in Germany&#39;s capital.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From its low-key offices near the center of the city, Rocket Internet has turned the usual business model for technology companies on its head, compiling a team of high-flying finance and management specialists and arming them with the money they need to mimic already successful Internet companies -- applying these proven ideas in other countries, often in emerging markets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since starting in 2007, Rocket has backed about 75 start-ups in more than 50 countries that now generate more than $3 billion in annual revenue and employ about 25,000 people.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The business model stands in sharp contrast with the ethos that dominates Silicon Valley, where originality is perceived as the main currency for successful start-ups. It also has raised questions over whether Europe&#39;s tech sector, where Rocket is a major player, can ever foster the same level of innovation that has led to a conveyor belt of successful American tech giants like Oracle, Google and Facebook.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, Rocket Internet balks at criticism that it is purely a copycat machine. It says all successful business ideas are somewhat borrowed from others, and the ability to take proven tech ideas to emerging markets is a skill unto itself. The small tech start-ups that Rocket supports are often given as little as six months to succeed or face being shut down.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;If there&#39;s a clear business model that is proven to work, we will look at it,&#39;&#39; said Oliver Samwer, 41, one of three brothers who started Rocket Internet, and who travels almost constantly to visit the company&#39;s global portfolio of tech start-ups. &#39;&#39;Every new company is like a speedboat, and we want them to become aircraft carriers.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Within the global tech community, Rocket Internet and the start-ups it incubates are known for aggressively expanding into new markets and squeezing out local rivals. Zalando, a German copy of the American</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-commerce firm Zappos, has spread to 15 European countries since starting in 2008 and reported a 52 percent rise in its sales, to $2.4 billion, last year. Rocket Internet recently sold its remaining stake in Zalando, which is valued at around $5 billion, to the Swedish investment company Kinnevik, one of Rocket&#39;s main investors, though the Samwer brothers retain a stake through their own investment firm.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Rocket-backed e-commerce start-ups, including the Latin American e-commerce site Dafiti and its Russian counterpart Lamoda, also have secured large market shares in some of the world&#39;s fastest-growing developing economies. To succeed, they have had to tweak their business models for emerging markets. That involves offering cash-on-delivery services where few consumers have credit cards and running large fleets of delivery trucks where local logistics and infrastructure remain basic.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rapid expansion has fueled speculation that some of the tech firms could either be bought by larger United States rivals that want to expand globally or potentially become public companies through multibillion-dollar initial public offerings.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Rocket has disrupted the entire venture capital industry,&#39;&#39; said Christophe F. Maire, a leading Berlin-based investor who has backed several of the city&#39;s best-known start-ups, though none from Rocket Internet. &#39;&#39;It has groomed a lot of people in the art of going international.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the success has also raised questions about the value of a company that essentially depends on the ideas of others. Although the Rocket-supported companies are free to copy existing tech businesses as long as they do not infringe on copyrights and trademarks, there is nothing to stop competitors from rising up and pursuing the same strategy. And some companies have already popped up to parrot Rocket&#39;s business model.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While the company has created a growing stable of global e-commerce start-ups, it has had less success with other Internet businesses. The company&#39;s version of Pinterest, for example, which allows people to share photographs and other media, has so far failed to win over many consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And after Airbnb held talks in 2011 about acquiring Rocket&#39;s Berlin-based copy, the American short-term housing website eventually decided to beef up its own international operations instead of buying the smaller rival.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Others in the tech industry question whether Rocket Internet can maintain its success rate, as start-ups from Silicon Valley to Singapore look to expand globally as quickly as possible. That could cut the time Rocket Internet has to replicate successful tech ideas in emerging economies and other non-American markets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Just copying what the Americans have done is no longer a sustainable model,&#39;&#39; said Simon Cook, chief executive of the European venture firm DFJ Espirit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So far, though, no one has found the kind of success that Rocket has.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We don&#39;t worry if someone else has launched a similar business model before,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Samwer, who receives monthly updates on the company&#39;s start-ups during a marathon 20-hour conference call where each business leader is allotted just 30 minutes of Mr. Samwer&#39;s time. &#39;&#39;The Internet moves at Formula One speed; execution is the most important component of a successful business.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The track record of the Samwer brothers behind the company -- Oliver, Marc and Alexander -- dates to the first dot-com boom when they sold Alando, a German version of eBay, to its larger American rival for $50 million. The entrepreneurs, who were in their mid-20s, built and sold the start-up in less than 100 days.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After the eBay deal, they used some of the proceeds to start Jamba, a mobile phone services company that produced the Crazy Frog ringtone, which they sold to the American tech company Verisign for $270 million in 2004. The three German brothers also have bought and sold stakes over the years in a number of high-profile American start-ups, including Facebook, Groupon and Zynga, which have gone on to become global household names.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, they focus their attention on building start-ups around the world. And the formula is relatively simple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Typically, Rocket&#39;s core team finds the ideas (on a few occasions, outsides have brought them business plans), then brings in entrepreneurs to run the businesses. The Samwer brothers give M.B.A. graduates and former banking traders -- often from companies like Goldman Sachs and McKinsey -- as much as $20 million in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">early-stage investment. They are then dispatched to distant places like Moscow and Jakarta, Indonesia, where American rivals have yet to establish a strong foothold. Along with borrowing ideas from some of the world&#39;s largest and most established e-commerce Internet companies, the company&#39;s entrepreneurs also have emulated younger businesses like Square, the mobile-payments company founded by Jack Dorsey, the chairman of Twitter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The pressure is intense on the start-up managers, who are usually paid a salary and do not receive a major stake in the company they operate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to harm their future career opportunities, remember high-pressured arguments when financial targets were not met and late-night calls from senior managers ordering them back to the office.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Ralf Wenzel and his company are evidence that the method works.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the co-founder of FoodPanda, an online takeout delivery service for restaurants that mirrors the popular American company GrubHub, Mr. Wenzel juggles a 650-person team spread across more than 40 countries.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Large flat-screen televisions throughout the open-plan office keep the staff of FoodPanda, which was founded in 2012 and has raised almost $50 million in venture capital, on top of food deliveries ranging from sushi orders in Moscow to takeout burgers in Hanoi, Vietnam.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We&#39;re a global, not European, company,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Wenzel, 35, who spends roughly 80 percent of his time traveling between the company&#39;s international offices. &#39;&#39;Getting to these new markets quickly gives us a huge competitive advantage.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pinterest, which allows people to share photographs and other media, left, is mimicked by Pinspire, above, from Rocket Internet.

All Rights Reserved. [Video: Netflix Drone To Home Watch on YouTube.]</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Netflix on Tuesday released a satirical video promising &#39;&#39;Drone to Home&#39;&#39; delivery of DVDs to customers, taking an obvious swipe at Amazon&#39;s plan to deliver items to consumers via small octocopters, a.k.a. drones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Netflix video quickly bounded across the Internet, passed along on Twitter and Facebook.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Barely a minute long, the video purports to show a Netflix warehouse with cute little copters flying off carrying the distinctive red Netflix DVD envelopes. &#39;&#39;Unlike other companies trying to rush unproven technology to market, we have literally spent days working out most of the bugs,&#39;&#39; the narrator says, as one woman tries to run away from a drone following her, and another explodes in the background.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even when the DVDs are delivered successfully, the delivery is a little too all-knowing -- through the open sunroof of a car, to a person camping, even to a man standing at a urinal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Netflix has lately had fun taking jabs at rivals, including HBO and now Amazon, whose Prime Instant Video streaming service is competing for viewers who watch TV and movies online. In Air Prime, the name for Amazon&#39;s drone delivery plan, Netflix has an easy target -- the idea is widely parodied online, with one popular version from the Taiwanese animators who make a living riffing on the news.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Close observers of the tech world took note of an ad in January for Amazon Prime, which includes free two-day shipping and video streaming, that referred indirectly to Netflix, saying, &#39;&#39;Who needs to subscribe to another video service? You get video, great movies right there on-demand as part of Prime.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Amazon plan came to light on &#39;&#39;60 Minutes&#39;&#39; in a rare interview with the company&#39;s founder, Jeff Bezos, who took the reporter Charlie Rose to a secret room where the drones were being tested. In the interview, which promoted the speed and applicability of drones to do many of the deliveries Amazon makes, Mr. Bezos alluded to the need to get everything right. &#39;&#39;Look, this thing can&#39;t land on someone&#39;s head while they are walking around -- that&#39;s not good.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTF000020140226ea2q0007e</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_008.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark10">INDIA INK</a><a name="bookmark11">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Questions Abound, but India Sees Room to Grow in E-Commerce</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By MARK BERGEN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,442 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24 February 2014 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 2</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BANGALORE -- Snapdeal and Flipkart, India&#39;s two largest online marketplaces, are frequently recipients of honorific, hopeful nicknames. They are, respectively, called the eBay and Amazon of India.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But lately, Kunal Bahl, the young chief executive of Snapdeal, has been drawing parallels with another</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-commerce juggernaut, Alibaba of China. India lags well behind China in e-commerce shoppers; incomes, credit card use and Internet penetration are lower as well. But the Indian e-commerce market has headroom, and its leaders are trying to convince the global finance world that Alibaba&#39;s success can be replicated in India.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bahl, 30, recently toured Silicon Valley, where the New Delhi-based company is said to be seeking $100 million in investment to give it a valuation of $750 million to $1 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eight years ago, Mr. Bahl, a graduate of the Wharton business school, was settling into corporate life in the United States, first with Deloitte, then Microsoft. But in 2007, his visa renewal was rejected, forcing him to return to India.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It was a blessing in disguise,&#39;&#39; he said in a recent interview in Bangalore. After starting Snapdeal, the baby-faced entrepreneur became a poster boy for the faults of American visa policy, landing at the center of an 2011 USA Today article on the technology brain drain in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At that time, Snapdeal had about 400 employees. Now, its staff of 1,300 coordinates deliveries to about 4,000 towns and cities in India. The company, incorporated as Jasper Infotech, has altered its shape along the way.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Mr. Bahl started his company with Rohit Bansal, a high school friend, the pair focused on online coupons, a model similar to Groupon&#39;s. They tried other iterations of deals and discount cards, with little momentum.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;For the first two years or so, we were struggling,&#39;&#39; Mr. Bahl recalled.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Feb. 4, 2010, Snapdeal.com began operations primarily as a website for restaurant discounts. A year later, the company received its first significant investment, from Nexus Venture Partners, and morphed into its current form, a marketplace for Indian sellers and buyers to find one another. Today, it lists goods from about 20,000 merchants in a variety of categories and has about 20 million registered users.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Bahl, whose father ran a small automotive parts business, casts Snapdeal as a champion of tiny enterprises in the country. &#39;&#39;Irrespective of who you may be, you have a level playing field against anyone in the market,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Estimates of the size of this market vary. The brokerage firm CLSA suggests Indian e-commerce will expand to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$22 billion, from $3.1 billion, in five years. Flipkart, a Bangalore company that sells books, clothes and electronics online, predicts a market of $70 billion by 2020.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the projections have grown rosier, technology investors have poured in funds. In a May 2013 report, Allegro Advisors, an investment bank, said 53 e-commerce companies in India had secured $853 million in venture capital funds in the previous three years.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But now, financing is slowing and several online retailers are shutting down. Analysts say the industry is consolidating, with the victors emerging. &#39;&#39;The e-commerce landscape in India is becoming clearer,&#39;&#39; said Deepak Srinath, an Allegro partner. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a two-horse race; it&#39;s Snapdeal and Flipkart.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Flipkart has netted about $540 million in funding since it began in 2007, including a $160 million investment in October. (In November 2012, a government agency began investigating whether Flipkart, which had received venture funds from American firms, had violated foreign investment laws.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Flipkart previously sold to consumers from an affiliated seller, WS Retail, before turning into a full merchant marketplace in April. So far, its marketplace has 1,000 sellers and 14 million registered users, well below Snapdeal&#39;s totals. For the past fiscal year, which ended in March 2013, Flipkart posted revenues of $190 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Srinath says Flipkart is leading in name recognition -- a crucial category in India, where brand and service matter immensely. When Motorola introduced its newest phone in India, on Feb. 6, it chose Flipkart as its exclusive vendor for early sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;It&#39;s almost like e-commerce is synonymous with Flipkart,&#39;&#39; Mr. Srinath said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bahl&#39;s company is now compared most often with eBay, which led a $50 million round of strategic funding in Snapdeal in June. Since 2011, the company has raised more than $200 million from investors, including Intel Capital and Nexus Venture Partners.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Bahl said Snapdeal planned to go public but would not specify a date. In an interview with VentureBeat, he said he was planning an initial public offering in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An I.P.O. would come after the company reached $1 billion in sales, he told India Ink. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ll be there in a matter of months,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Likewise, Flipkart has broadcast its desire to file an I.P.O., although it has no &#39;&#39;fixed timelines,&#39;&#39; a company spokeswoman in India said in an email. The company expects to hit $1 billion in sales by 2015.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The two firms may be racing to go public for an unspoken reason. One technology industry adviser suggests that India&#39;s online shopping potential is being oversold, saying that e-commerce firms may be increasing their sales but are not adding new users as quickly as they claim.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To warrant a large valuation, either company would need to mimic Alibaba&#39;s spectacular success and quickly reach 100 million Indian shoppers. This is unlikely, said the adviser, who asked for anonymity because his data on the companies was not public.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If that truth surfaces with one I.P.O., a second would fetch much less interest, he said. In short, India won&#39;t produce an Alibaba, let alone two.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Until either company goes public, parsing their financial data is very difficult, said Aditya Rath, an associate director at PricewaterhouseCoopers India. &#39;&#39;I would not be overly enthusiastic about sales,&#39;&#39; he cautioned.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For Snapdeal, he added, a bigger question lingers: &#39;&#39;When are they going to meet their investment targets?&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Snapdeal has set ambitious goals before. In a 2010 interview, Mr. Bahl pledged that the company would soon be expanding to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Singapore. Those plans were shelved; the company is focused solely on India now.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the moment, India&#39;s surviving online retailers are sheltered from competition abroad, thanks to the government. In September 2012, India&#39;s cabinet opened its retail sector to foreign direct investment but excluded e-commerce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which entered India in June, spent some of its lobbying funds in the United States on issues related to India&#39;s foreign direct investment laws, according to the company&#39;s latest disclosure. Industry experts do not expect the law to change soon, particularly not before the May elections.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But Amazon isn&#39;t holding back. On Feb. 5, the company added luggage, video games and music to its product list in India. The list now encompasses 900,000 items, excluding books, and it has 2,300 sellers in India. It is working with the postal service to ship to remote areas and has started same-day delivery in six Indian cities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In its latest earnings report, Amazon posted $74.5 billion in global sales in 2013, with a market capitalization more than twice that -- dwarfing both Flipkart and Snapdeal.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, analysts noted that Indian companies would not necessarily be plowed under if foreign e-commerce arrived in full force. India&#39;s market is diverse and complex, traits that give local companies a leg up. A total of 65 percent of Snapdeal&#39;s customers pay in cash; other companies see even higher rates. And India&#39;s poor roads and highways make logistics difficult.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bahl insisted that Snapdeal, as it grew and shape-shifted, had adapted enough to the peculiarities of India to handle competition. When asked about his better-funded rivals, Mr. Bahl offered a boastful verdict on his industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It&#39;s not about the money that you have in the bank; it&#39;s how you spend it,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;This is a game of execution. India&#39;s not an easy market to execute in.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Mark Bergen is a freelance journalist based in Bangalore.

This past week a British court ruled in Lush’s favor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lush says its does not sell its products on Amazon, because it strongly disagrees with the company’s tax practices. Amazon has been criticized for minimizing its taxes in Britain by routing sales to British customers through Luxembourg.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In ruling for Lush on Monday, Judge John Baldwin of the High Court said the right of the public to benefit from retail technologies did ‘‘not go so far as to allow a trader such as Amazon to ride roughshod over intellectual property rights.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon plans to appeal the decision, a spokesman, Ben Howes, said Friday.Mr. North, meanwhile, is said to be ‘‘hopping mad’’ about his namesake shower gel, his lawyers were quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mark and Mo Constantine, who founded Lush in 1995, said they had tried to resolve the issue amicably. ‘‘We asked them 17 times before we went to court,’’ Mr. Constantine told The Guardian.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lush brought the case after Amazon bid on keywords containing ‘‘lush’’ within Google’s AdWords service as a way to drive traffic to the Amazon site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Constantines said that the Christopher North shower gel had not actually gone on sale. But now that Amazon is fighting the court ruling, they say, they are no longer ruling out a range that might include deodorant and leg wax.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And in case Amazon was considering a counterattack, Mr. Constantine has reportedly bought the trademark to his own name.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140215ea2f00007</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_010.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark14">State of the Art Technology; Personal Tech</a><a name="bookmark15">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">How to Survive the Next Wave of Technology Extinction</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By FARHAD MANJOO</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,338 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13 February 2014 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014.

After failing to douse Amazon’s Kindle, Barnes &amp; Noble has spent the last year refashioning its Nook strategy, and with </a><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/barnes-and-noble-hardware-engineering-staff-2014-2" class="a" target="_blank">its recent reductions</a> <span style=" color: #000;">in e-reader staff, the Nook’s end looks nigh. If you own a Nook, the fate of your books may now be up in the air. Sorry, you bet on the wrong horse.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3006699/tech-edge/when-it-comes-to-tech-investing-vcs-are-venturing-forth-cautiously" class="s1" target="_blank">The Nook’s fate isn’t unusual these days. Technologies have always gone belly up, but tech extinctions may become even more common over the next few years. We’re living through an exhilarating and mystifying time in the tech business, when every established brand and business model — from the Windows PC to the whole idea of selling software and hardware for a profit — </a>is suddenly under assault<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Today, five behemoths — Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft — plus a dizzying array of start-ups are competing to win every dollar and minute you spend in tech. While each of these companies offers differing sets of technologies sold under widely varying business models, they all share a common feature — trying to hook you deeply into an ecosystem of interconnected technologies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The trouble arises when you are sold on a tech ecosystem that doesn’t prosper. It’s likely that at least one, if not several, of today’s tech behemoths won’t be around a decade from now. Thus the pervasive worry of choosing tech in these uncertain days: How do you avoid betting on the wrong horse?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is hope. By following a simple strategy, you can get the most out of the digital world while reducing the chance you’ll be burned by a single wrong move. The point is to minimize the danger of getting locked in to any one company’s ecosystem. The strategy also ensures that you can easily move from device to device without much hassle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The key is promiscuity. When you decide what to use, you’ve got to play every tech giant against the other, to make every tech decision as if you were a cad — sample every firm’s best features and never overcommit to any one.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This sounds difficult. It isn’t. Here’s the game plan:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://gizmodo.com/one-huge-reason-to-not-switch-to-android-or-windows-1301382833" class="s1" target="_blank">BUY APPLE’S HARDWARE Apple’s phones, tablets and PCs are the best-designed and best-made computers on the market. They are also the easiest to learn to use and the most durable. And if you’re kind to them, they’ll </a><a href="http://gizmodo.com/one-huge-reason-to-not-switch-to-android-or-windows-1301382833" class="a" target="_blank">carry a far higher resale value</a> <span style=" color: #000;">than rival devices.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I say this after having tried just about every competitor to Apple’s machines. Some non-Apple phones and tablets are nearly as nice as the iPhone and iPad (Google’s Nexus line is quite good), but I haven’t found any that beat it, and none that are as pleasurable to use.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But the best thing about Apple’s hardware is that it maximizes your ability to be promiscuous with software. Apple’s App Store is home to more programs than any other app marketplace. What’s more, the most innovative</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://stevecheney.com/why-android-first-is-a-myth/" class="s1" target="_blank">start-up firms often create apps for Apple’s platform </a>before they bother with Android<span class="p">. Since software is the soul of a machine, the source of all our devices’ advancing powers, you’re best off getting the gadgets that can run the widest range of software. (A note for the sticklers: Yes, Apple restricts the ways you can tinker with the deeper parts of your mobile devices. But if you’re a tinkerer, you don’t need to read a column to decide what to buy.)</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/07/google_v_flickr_the_best_place_to_store_your_photos.html" class="s1" target="_blank">USE GOOGLE’S SERVICES. My phone and tablet carry Apple’s logo, but almost everything I do with them is routed through the search company’s servers. There’s Google’s Gmail app for email, Google’s Calendar to manage your day, Google Maps to tell you where to go, Chrome to browse the Web and even the otherwise useless Google Plus social network </a>to back up your photos<span class="p">.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Throwing your data at Google is a good idea for two reasons: First, the company is incredibly good at managing it; it lets you have access to stuff on pretty much any device, anywhere in the world, all the time. Its services almost never go down, its data is extremely accurate (see Maps), and, barring</a> intrusion by the N.S.A.<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/180744?hl=en" class="s1" target="_blank">, Google offers solid security (like </a>two-factor authentication<span class="p">).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I also love the handy tricks Google adds as it learns more and more about me (yes, I’m aware I sound like a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">P.O.W. praising my jailers — but count my blinks, it’s true). For instance, its Google Now feature, available as part of the Google Search app on the iPhone, can automatically predict what you are doing next and show you relevant information like traffic directions and boarding passes just when you need it. It even automatically enhances your photos, making your pretty face even prettier.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en" class="s1" target="_blank">Wait a second, though — aren’t you committing to Google by giving it all your stuff? Nope, because here’s the best thing: Unlike many of its rivals, </a><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en" class="a" target="_blank">Google allows you to download your personal data</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/takeout" class="s1" target="_blank">from </a><u>most of its services</u> <span style=" color: #000;">so you can easily move to some other pusher.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">BUY MEDIA FROM AMAZON. This one is a no-brainer. If you’re looking to buy a movie on your Windows laptop today, shouldn’t you get one that will also work on an Android tablet you buy tomorrow? If you buy a book to read on your iPad, shouldn’t you also make sure it works on the Kindle you’re planning to get for Christmas?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Different media providers offer different levels of such interoperability, but books, music and movies from Amazon are the most widely viewable. You can watch and read Amazon’s media on Apple devices, Google devices, Amazon’s own Kindle line and lots of other places, like cheap streaming devices for your TV. In contrast, a book from Apple’s iBookstore is probably never going to work on an Android phone, because Apple really doesn’t want you to buy an Android phone. So why bother with iBooks?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BET ON CONNECTORS. In our multidevice world, Amazon’s media store functions as what I like to call a “connector” — it bridges the chasm between otherwise foreign technologies.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">This gets to the most important principle for dealing with an uncertain future: Invest your time and money in connectors. For instance, store all your important documents on the cloud-storage service </a>Dropbox<a href="https://evernote.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">, because its business model depends on it working everywhere. And it does: The documents you create on any single machine are replicated on all your other machines, instantly. Similarly, when someone hands you a business card, you can snap a photo of it on the note-taking app </a>Evernote<span class="p">, which also functions as a connector, letting you get at your scribbles regardless of which machine you move to next. And in a cloudy future, who knows what that could be?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stuart Goldenberg | Apple’s hardware, including the iPad, allows you to maximize your ability to be promiscuous with software. | Quinn Rooney/Getty Images | Google Street View cameras have been all over, including a beach in the Florida Panhandle. | Colin Hackley/Visit Florida, via Associated Press | Amazon&#39;s Kindle app for the iPad.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020140212ea2d0035x</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_011.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark16">India Ink</a><a name="bookmark17">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">World; Asia Pacific</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Penguin Withdraws Book by American Scholar of Hinduism to Settle Lawsuit</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">761 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11 February 2014 NYT Blogs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

Prior to the lawsuit, he filed </a><a href="http://www.bharatiyashiksha.com/?p=217" class="a" target="_blank">a notice</a> <span style=" color: #000;">to Ms. Doniger and Penguin Group USA , then the parent of Penguin Books India, in 2010, saying that Ms. Doniger’s book “has hurt the religious feelings of millions of Hindus” and therefore breached section 295A of the Indian Penal Code.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The book, which was released in the United States and India in 2009, offended Hindus because of its “tendency to over-eroticize” the religion, said Ashok Malik, a journalist who reviewed “The Hindus” when it first came out. “I thought it was overdone.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, he did not support Penguin Books India’s decision to withdraw the book. “Why did Penguin go for an out-of-court settlement? They could have waited for a judgment,” he said. “This is part of a larger trend where publishers keep away from controversial topics.”</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/books/review/Mishra-t.html?_r=0" class="s1" target="_blank">In a </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/books/review/Mishra-t.html?_r=0" class="a" target="_blank">New York Times book review</a> <span style=" color: #000;">, the author Pankaj Mishra called the book “a salutary antidote to the fanatics who perceive — correctly — the fluid existential identities and commodious metaphysic of practiced Indian religions as a threat to their project of a culturally homogenous and militant nation-state.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Batra said in an interview Tuesday that Shiksha Bachao Andolan would continue to battle books that hurt religious sentiment, and Madan Mohan Sharma, a member of Bharatiya Shiksha, a sister organization, said the group felt vindicated by Penguin Books India’s decision.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In an email to India Ink, Ms. Doniger said that she was “angry and disappointed, and deeply concerned for freedom of speech in India.” Penguin India did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The book is not banned in India, and it is still available as an e-book on Amazon. “If a smaller publisher wants to get the rights transferred and publish it, they could,” said Nilanjana S. Roy, an author who is also a New York Times op-ed contributor. “But most publishers would not want this. Going to the courts is not what a publisher wants to do.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Doniger’s scholarly work has drawn opposition from Hindu groups in India and overseas. During a lecture in London in 2003, Ms. Doniger was almost hit by an egg thrown by a Hindu nationalist who was angry at the “sexual thrust” of her interpretation of the “sacred” “Ramayana,” Mr. Mishra wrote in his book review.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/petitions/dharma10/signatures" class="s1" target="_blank">In 2010, </a><a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/petitions/dharma10/signatures" class="a" target="_blank">an online petition</a> <span style=" color: #000;">started by the Sarasvati Research Trust, an educational institution based in New Delhi, demanded that Penguin Group USA withdraw the book from India.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Roy said Penguin Books India’s settlement sets a bad example. “There will be more people who would put pressure on the publishers, and they would not have the resources or the time to stand up for each of their books,” she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last month, Bloomsbury India withdrew “The Descent of Air India ,” by Jitender Bhargava, a former Air India executive director, who wrote about the national airline’s recent turbulent history. Local media reports said a lawsuit was filed by a former minister who was blamed in the book for causing the airline’s downfall. The publisher also issued a public apology to the minister.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Vikram Sampath, an author and the organizer of the Bangalore Literary Festival said, “The answer to a book you don’t agree with is another one –not a ban or withdrawal. If this trend continues, we will be left with chick lit books only, unfortunately.”</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://twitter.com/Raksha_Kumar" class="s1" target="_blank">Raksha Kumar is a freelance journalist.

If you think about it, though, the ease with which packages are moved over long distances really is a miracle, and involves some incredibly sophisticated capabilities, like route optimization and real-time tracking.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Personally, I think UPS and FedEx could do a better job of highlighting just how good they have become at moving stuff.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/01/amazon_earnings_how_jeff_bezos_gets_investors_to_believe_in_him.html" class="s1" target="_blank">And maybe that is why Amazon does not want to acknowledge that anything tricky happens after your order leaves the warehouse. It doesn’t own the delivery services, and it doesn’t want to empower other corporations, so it hides the costs involved. That seems to be a reasonable strategy — especially if it doesn’t </a>need to make a profit<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What does this have to do with Paul Downs Cabinetmakers? A lot, actually. It’s about the expectations that are being created for online shoppers everywhere. We are being taught to think only of the thing we buy and not to consider where it came from or how it gets to us. The upside of this is that we have access to an incredible variety of stuff from all around the world. And the downside? For buyers, there may not be one. But for sellers, it means that a significant cost needs to be considered in a new way. It is increasingly difficult to pass on the costs of shipping by simply tacking them onto the item price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ten years ago, through no efforts of my own, Google vaulted my work to the top of organic search results for a particular product, conference tables. Suddenly my market expanded from local to national. It took us a while to master the shipping of large, delicate objects over long distances, but we have become very good at it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When we started shipping our work, we added a line item to our price quotes, separating the cost of freight from the price of the table. We are able to get an instant price estimate for shipping our work nearly anywhere, but it is just an estimate because the numbers are based on the exact size and weight of the crate, which we do not know until the table is complete. So we list shipping as a separate line item in the price quote and try to close deals.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of our clients do not question the line item, and they place the order. Some grumble a bit and place the order anyway. And some look at the total cost and decide not to place the order. The additional cost is an issue, particularly for clients west of the Mississippi, which is why we do not do as much business there as I would like.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/business/smallbusiness/mistake-in-a-pay-per-click-campaign-leaves-a-business-puzzled.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Last week, I was showing a new employee how our </a>Google AdWords campaign works<span class="p">. I noticed that a couple of new competitors were showing up on some of our searches — and that all of their ads included the promise of free shipping. Our ad was the exception. It promises a bunch of good things but not that we will eat the cost of transporting large tables across our enormous country. Seeing the competition throw down that offer made me say, “Hmmmm, could we do that?”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We send our tables to distant customers via LTL — less-than-truckload — trucking services. The parts of the table are packed in foam and cardboard and then into a custom crate. These are big — usually eight feet long, four feet wide and four feet tall — and generally weigh about 850 pounds. The labor and materials required to pack up the tables is always included in the price of the table. We charge for the trucking and the installation in a separate line item.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I read through my competitors’ sites to review their terms. In every offer I looked at, installation services were excluded. So we were really talking about the trucker’s charges. These are not nothing, but they also are not, for us, a deal-breaker. In 2013 we had revenue of $2.6 million. Of that, we paid out $87,000 for freight, or 3.32 percent, which is not a huge percentage. On the other hand, it was more than we generated in profits last year. Let’s leave that aside for a moment and look at the pros and cons of offering free shipping.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Pros:</p><ul id="l2"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our pricing formulas, which predict the amount of time required to make a table, are being overtaken by increased efficiency on the shop floor. Our actual labor costs per table are dropping fast. So we have some extra money available to strengthen our marketing efforts, without raising prices for the tables themselves.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our clients do not seem to object to the price of the tables (at least as far as we can tell). We do know, however, that they object to paying shipping — we close far fewer sales on West Coast inquiries.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While I have no intention of giving away the freight, we could hide it in our prices. We could build a fixed shipping cost into every job, adjust the hours estimate to account for our improved efficiency and keep prices the same.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our most profitable tables are in<a href="http://www.custom-conference-tables.com/custom-conference-table-gallery-premium.aspx" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.custom-conference-tables.com/custom-conference-table-gallery-premium.aspx" class="a" target="_blank">the middle of our price </a><span class="s4">range</span>, generally $10,000 to $20,000. In 2013, the percentage of our revenue produced by that band fell to 33 percent, down from 36 percent the year before. I’d like that segment to grow.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Omitting free shipping from our ads probably makes them less effective, particularly if our competition is trumpeting that benefit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Cons:</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It ain’t broke, so maybe we shouldn’t fix it. Good clients expect to pay shipping; only bottom feeders want it free. (On the other hand, folding a fixed shipping charge into our table prices would increase the price of the lower-cost tables by the highest proportion, while the higher-cost tables will look cheaper by comparison.)</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We might devalue our brand. When I click through the ads that offer free shipping, I generally land on sites with cheap product. Will we start to seem like those vendors?</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Could a flood of cheapskate buyers overwhelm our sales staff? Possibly, but we take good records of incoming calls, so we can identify any change in the overall pattern of callers. We could change course if that happens.</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So that’s my question, one that might be of interest to any small business that wants to use the Internet to expand its market from local to national or international: Should I offer free shipping? I am leaning strongly toward it, but since I have the opportunity to put this problem in front of my readers, I won’t do anything until I hear from you.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What would you do?</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://custom-conference-tables.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">Paul Downs founded </a><a href="http://custom-conference-tables.com/" class="a" target="_blank">Paul Downs Cabinetmakers</a> <span style=" color: #000;">in 1986.

Your positive reviews could help them become series, joining “Alpha House” and “Betas” from the first round last year.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And there may be evidence that the Amazon system works, to a point, because the three comedies on offer are in some ways an advance over the comedies from last time — more polished and artful, if also more calculated and conventional. More like television, in fact. (Which could just mean that they had larger budgets.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maybe the same evolution will take place with dramas, because the two that went up this week, the company’s first, leave a lot of room for improvement. This is especially disappointing because both projects involved intriguing talent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s no surprise that “The After,” written and directed by Chris Carter, doesn’t live up to his first and greatest TV creation, “The X-Files” — his subsequent series didn’t (though “Millennium” had its moments) and neither have any of the many “X-Files” imitations from other producers. But “The After” pilot is surprisingly, almost distressingly bad. It has the feel of an elaborate put-on whose meta-joke is never revealed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A particularly cliché-ridden group — an Irish drunk, a black convict, a smarmy lawyer (Adrian Pasdar from “Heroes”), a French actress, a dithering Beverly Hills matron (Sharon Lawrence, unrecognizable) and a clown in full costume — are thrown together by a ludicrous series of contrivances during an unspecified apocalyptic event. The nature of the crisis (earthquake, terrorist attack, alien invasion, the Rapture) is kept vague, allowing for portentous speculation about redemption and the wages of sin.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To be fair, in its last moments, “The After” suddenly veers into the kind of straight-up horror that “The X-Files” excelled at, offering a slight reason to stick with it if Amazon gives it a series order.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The second drama, “Bosch,” is a neo-noir cop show that also carries the imprimatur of a well-known writer. In this case it’s the mystery novelist Michael Connelly, who wrote the script (based on his Harry Bosch series) with the TV writer Eric Overmyer (“The Wire,” “Treme”). But the real reason to be excited about the pilot was its casting: Bosch, a hard-core Los Angeles police detective, is played by the excellent actor Titus Welliver, whose quiet, coiled aggression has been seen to good effect in “The Good Wife” and “Sons of Anarchy.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even Mr. Welliver, however, can’t enliven “Bosch,” which is dead on the page, despite the best efforts of the accomplished director Jim McKay and an abundance of evocative Los Angeles locations. (Like Elliott Gould’s Philip Marlowe in the Robert Altman adaptation of “The Long Goodbye,” Bosch lives in an improbably picturesque home with a multimillion-dollar view.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The script by Mr. Connelly and Mr. Overmyer illustrates how hard it is to transfer romanticized pulp to the screen without making it stilted, flat and overly expository, as well as how important it is to avoid the genre’s more familiar aspects. When Bosch, who’s on trial for excessive force, encounters the obligatory cops from internal affairs and calls them the rat squad, it’s about time to give up. Again, though: If the show gets made, it will be worth going back to see whether Mr. Welliver can find something in the character besides the dark past and grim present he’s been given so far.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/arts/television/07stew.html" class="s1" target="_blank">The comedies are all better, but not in earthshaking ways. The most TV-ready of the three is probably “Mozart in the Jungle,” written by Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman and Alex Timbers and directed by Paul Weitz (“About a Boy”). It’s set in the world of classical music and tries to combine the dark backstage comedy of “</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/arts/television/07stew.html" class="a" target="_blank">Slings</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/arts/television/07stew.html" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/arts/television/07stew.html" class="a" target="_blank">and Arrows</a>” with the gilded New York debauchery of “Sex and the City.” Gael García Bernal is quite amusing as a young maverick conductor hired by a fictional New York orchestra, Saffron Burrows less so as a veteran cellist. Malcolm McDowell and Bernadette Peters guest star.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The Rebels” stars Natalie Zea as a former cheerleader whose husband dies and leaves her a professional football team, which she decides to run with the help of an inexperienced young general manager (Josh Peck). The pilot is mostly worth watching for Billy Dee Williams’s cameo as the coach.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The most distinctive, though not necessarily the most enjoyable, of the half-hour pilots is “Transparent,” a family dramedy that has some of the L.A.-grotesque flavor of “Six Feet Under” — on which its writer and director, Jill Soloway, worked — but framed in a more mainstream, “Parenthood” style, with just a touch of “Arrested Development” zaniness. Reinforcing that last connection is the presence of Jeffrey Tambor, who gives what could grow into a great performance as a father with a secret that’s more life-changing than just selling the family home.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/amazon-publishing-starts-a-christian-imprint/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Publishing Starts a Christian </a><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/amazon-publishing-starts-a-christian-imprint/" target="_blank">Imprint</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/springsteen-album-leaked-through-amazon-download/" class="a" target="_blank">Springsteen Album Leaked Through Amazon </a><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/springsteen-album-leaked-through-amazon-download/" target="_blank">Download</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/art-collectors-diary-me-my-mouse-and-i/" class="a" target="_blank">Art Collector’s Diary: Me, My Mouse and </a><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/art-collectors-diary-me-my-mouse-and-i/" target="_blank">I</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/amazon-reviewers-have-a-few-thoughts-about-that-monet/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Reviewers Have a Few Thoughts About That </a><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/amazon-reviewers-have-a-few-thoughts-about-that-monet/" target="_blank">Monet</a></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon Re-Enters Online Art Market<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020140207ea27002ms</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_014.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark22">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark23">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">When Your App Is in the Cloud</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">761 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 February 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

Revenue last year was about $50 million, more than double the year before, he said.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Twilio generally sits in the background while larger companies use its technology to quickly create things like customer call centers, collaborative communications networks or text and image-messaging functions.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.tropo.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">Another company, called </a>Tropo<a href="http://plivo.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">, also allows for faster deployment of communications applications, while others create cloud-based call centers. </a><a href="http://plivo.com/" class="a" target="_blank">Plivo</a><span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">may be Twilio’s most direct competitor, with cloud-based voice services that can be added to apps.

Mr. Lawson said Twilio beats the incumbents by 90 percent or more on both counts, but it’s hard to judge that claim independently (though even 50 percent would be impressive). A Cisco spokesman said the two products are not directly comparable, since Cisco’s product can do many more things.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What usually happens next with these cloud products, however, is where it gets more interesting.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/technology/ibm-to-announce-more-powerful-watson-via-the-internet.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Software developers find new things they can do, once factors like speed and cost become less limiting.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon investors might have finally heard the news they have been waiting for: The retailer is raising shipping fees.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has 237 million active customers but as a general rule makes almost no profit. Thursday’s announcement that the company was considering raising prices by as much as 50 percent on its $79 Prime shipping program could mean $500 million for its skimpy bottom line.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“This is the first time we’ve ever seen Amazon flex its muscles in terms of pricing,” said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. “It’s hugely significant.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The news came in a conference call when the Seattle-based retailer discussed its fourth-quarter earnings. The announcement helped deflect disappointment that Amazon’s torrid growth might be slowing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has been pouring money into new ventures, ranging from new warehouses to free videos for Prime subscribers. The eternal question is when it will turn all that expansion into profits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Raising fees for the estimated 25 million Prime subscribers indicates that moment might be sooner, rather than later.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">“They don’t think they will lose customers,” Mr. Munster said. “They are doing this from a position of strength.” Still, there are risks for Amazon.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The more expensive Prime is, the more they are going to have to live up to their promises,” said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research. “In my experience, a significant portion of the deliveries take more than the advertised two days.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">By her estimates, Amazon is losing $1 billion to $2 billion a year on Prime. Without the Prime news, the dismay over the results would have been palpable.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1895485&amp;highlight" class="s1" target="_blank">Considered in isolation, the </a><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1895485&amp;highlight" class="a" target="_blank">quarterly numbers</a> <span style=" color: #000;">were terrific. Revenue was $25.59 billion, up 20 percent from the quarter in 2012. Earnings per share were 51 cents, up from 21 cents.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But expectation is all, and Wall Street expected more. Analysts had forecast the retailer would report revenue of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">$26.06 billion and earnings of 66 cents a share. The stock immediately fell as much as 10 percent, or $40. Then came word of the potential Prime increase, the first in the program’s nine years.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The stock quickly shaved about half its losses, dropping only 4 percent in after-hours trading.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon shares had been up sharply in regular trading Thursday. They rose $18.81, to $403.01, just short of the stock’s record high.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thomas J. Szkutak, Amazon’s chief financial officer, said the price increase for Prime, if it happens, would be $20 to $40.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Shipping costs have gone up a lot, fuel costs have gone up a lot,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He gave few other details, nor would he say exactly how many Prime customers there are.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is usually downbeat about the next quarter, and in this it did not disappoint. Sales would grow in the first quarter by 13 to 24 percent from 2013, the company said, while it once again forecast that it might lose money. Operating income in the first quarter of 2013 was $181 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite its new ventures, Amazon is still primarily a retailer, which makes its growth all the more remarkable. Amazon revenue grew 22 percent in 2013. Walmart’s sales, by comparison, rose only 2.2 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 4pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, in fact, is growing faster than global e-commerce sales, which according to emarketer.com rose 18 percent last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 2pt;text-align: left;">“Amazon has a reputation among consumers of being the lowest price, even if they are not always, and of having the best shipping,” said Yoram Wurmser, an e-marketer retail analyst. “Eventually they’ll run out of white space but in the meantime they are entering new markets like groceries.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company’s valuation is increasing so fast — shares are up tenfold in five years — that skeptics wonder if things are getting out of hand.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners who has been cautious on Amazon’s prospects, laid out some of the growth conundrums on Thursday in a research note.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is now valued at $176 billion, he said, which gives it the 17th-largest valuation in the S.&amp;P. 500-stock index. But Amazon also has by far the highest price to earnings ratio among companies with a market capitalization above $25 billion. It’s ranked only 18th in revenue growth using the same criteria.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We see that the price investors are paying is expensive for the current level of revenue growth given the uncertainty around the degree of leverage that the company may be able to achieve,” Mr. Gillis wrote. Amazon may be the next Walmart, he added, but “it may take years for Amazon to grow into this valuation fully.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A worker at an Amazon warehouse in Phoenix before Cyber Monday, one of the biggest online shopping days of the year. | Ralph D.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post has significantly increased its budget and plans to make dozens of newsroom hires under its new owner, the Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, the paper’s executive editor, Marty Baron, said in an interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos has closely consulted with The Post’s leadership in plotting its growth strategy and the moves represent Mr. Bezos’ ‘‘first mark on the paper,’’ Mr. Baron said Wednesday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Post will introduce several initiatives this year, Mr. Baron said in a memo to his staff on Wednesday. There will be five new politics reporters as well as photo editors, data visualization specialists, news desk staff and web designers. It will add a breaking news desk and a Sunday style and arts section, as well as a revamped Sunday magazine that will be ‘‘bigger in dimension and in the number of pages, with a new design and a range of new features.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The plan will be executed quickly — interviews for new hires began weeks ago — and represents ‘‘a substantial expansion of the budget,’’ Mr. Baron said, though he declined to provide precise figures.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shortly after Mr. Bezos bought the paper, Mr. Baron and other senior staff were ‘‘asked to come up with ideas for what we wanted to do,’’ Mr. Baron said. In late October, he and several colleagues flew to Bellevue, Wash., to meet with Mr. Bezos and present the plan. There were also conference calls and email exchanges, as well as</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in-person meetings at The Post’s offices in Washington.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Bezos would ‘‘just challenge our assumptions, cause us to rethink things,’’ he said. ‘‘He’s spent his entire life and his entire career thinking about where the consumer will be in the long run, and where the technology will be in the long run.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The crucial question, and the one that preoccupies Mr. Bezos, Mr. Baron said, is, ‘‘How do we produce growth?’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘And obviously our growth,’’ said Mr. Baron, ‘‘as well as the growth of institutions like The New York Times is likely to come from the digital arena.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There has been fervent speculation about Mr. Bezos’ intentions since August, when he announced that he was paying $250 million in cash to acquire The Post. Many hoped he would try to reinvent the ailing newspaper business just as he had revolutionized retail at Amazon.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Baron said he believed that Mr. Bezos ‘‘was purchasing The Post in order to make more of it, rather than make less of it.’’ That became clear in their discussions about the paper’s initiatives.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘His entire business history is oriented around growth,’’ Mr. Baron said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos has not weighed in on individual hires, Mr. Baron said, but his involvement has been more at a strategic level, discussing the paper’s priorities and goals.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘He hasn’t been passive,’’ Mr. Baron said. ‘‘He’s heavily engaged, keenly interested in what our ideas are. He offered his own thoughts and expressed a willingness to invest.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140130ea1v0006p</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_018.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark30">Front Row Fashion &amp; Style</a><a name="bookmark31">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">A Vogue Alum Dives Into Digital With Zappos</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By JOHN KOBLIN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">746 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23 January 2014 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IN THE 11 MONTHS since the fashion eminence André Leon Talley parted company with Vogue, he has pursued a number of new gigs. Since February, he has been an editor at large for the Russian version of Numéro magazine. There was talk of a late-night TV show, which has not gotten off the ground. “Nothing has happened with that recently, no meetings, nothing is happening,” Mr. Talley said. (“My Ed McMahon would be Gloria von Thurn und Taxis,” he joked.) Recently he interviewed Diane von Furstenberg for “Entertainment Tonight.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And in December, Mr. Talley was named artistic director for Zappos, the online retailer specializing in shoes and known for its perky customer service representatives and relaxed return policy. Well, to be precise, he’ll be the artistic director for Zappos’s lesser-known couture site, where the same return policy exists. (Whether it’s a pair of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$50 Chucks or a $2,050 Calvin Klein whisper white dress, customers have a year to return the item.) On Wednesday, Zappos Couture revealed its redesigned website with Mr. Talley as the centerpiece.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I took the job because I felt that this was a new experiment that I needed to have going toward the future because digital and online is so important in today’s world,” Mr. Talley said in a phone interview from Basta Pasta in Manhattan.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The reconceived site will include features like Dude of the Month (Mr. Talley’s friend Marc Jacobs is up first), book recommendations (Mr. Talley is a very big fan of the Mike Tyson memoir, “Undisputed Truth”) and commentary on celebrities and apparel. For the debut, Mr. Talley tapped the fashion photographer Francesco Carrozzini, the son of the Italian Vogue editor Franca Sozzani, to shoot an editorial feature.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the Zappos team, Mr. Talley’s presence on the site, not to mention his Rolodex, is a welcome one. Zappos Couture has existed since 2004, but it has had a hard time attracting luxury designers and brands to the site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It’s definitely been a slow process, for sure,” said Jennifer Sidary, the head of Zappos Couture.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Sidary was approached by Mr. Talley’s agent at Designers Management Agency shortly after she spoke at a digital conference hosted by Women’s Wear Daily in June.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“André and his team didn’t even know that we had a couture site because it’s still kind of a well-kept secret among customers and brands,” Ms. Sidary said. Since Mr. Talley has come on board, she said, Oscar de la Renta has agreed to sell jewelry and handbags on the site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Talley is well known for his devotion to fashion history, and his deep connections to the industry — he revealed in a talk at the 92nd Street Y last year that Karl Lagerfeld gave him $50,000 for his 50th birthday — but he said that the new job was teaching him to look at fashion a little differently.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I was looking at shoes at the store I just left today, and I didn’t think, ‘Oh, those shoes I like,’ ” he said. “I thought, ‘Will that customer respond to that shoe in a picture on their computer?’ ”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though Mr. Talley sounded a bit wistful for his days at Vogue (“I miss the gilded cage,” he said. “That’s with a capital G and a capital C.”), the new job has perks, too. His salary at Zappos Couture is “very generous, very generous,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Money isn’t everything, but when you become my age at 65 and you’re thinking of going into the second, the third, the fourth stage, you have to think about money,” he said. (Likewise, he told Women’s Wear Daily after he joined Russia Numéro last year that he “needed more financial security.”)</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Despite making the transition into digital, Mr. Talley has never bought a clothing item online. “I have, of course, not bought anything online except music and books,” he said.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Sidary, for one, is hopeful that in time he will become an online Zappos customer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“He can definitely start buying Uggs on our Zappos site,” she said. “We actually even carry his size. Maybe I can get him to start buying his Uggs online, right?”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zappos Couture revealed its redesigned website with the fashion eminence André Leon Talley as the centerpiece. | Elizabeth Lippman for The New York Times</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020140122ea1n003ux</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_019.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark32">SMALL BUSINESS</a><a name="bookmark33">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Some Businesses Go Creative on Prices, Applying Technology</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DONNA FENN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,378 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23 January 2014 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Many business owners struggle with pricing. Should their first concern be covering costs or figuring out what the market will bear? How do they determine what the market will pay without raising prices high enough that some customers flee? And can they offer discounts without damaging their price brand?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There may be no easy or universal answers to these questions, but new thinking and new technology has made it possible for some, like the airline and hotel industries, to use what is known as dynamic pricing to vary prices according to demand and fill seats and rooms more efficiently. Now, more small businesses are finding ways to adapt their strategies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can find consultants that charge for results rather than by the hour, restaurants that charge what is essentially a ticket price that varies according to how busy the restaurant is, and even some businesses that ask customers to pay what they wish.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And Uber, a Silicon Valley company founded four years ago, has a mobile app that connects a small army of black cars with people who need rides in 70 cities worldwide and employs &#39;&#39;surge pricing.&#39;&#39; Uber, which takes 20 percent of all fares, charges more when demand is high and the supply of cars low.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;You get far more cars on the road and they stay out longer when surge pricing is in effect,&#39;&#39; said Travis Kalanick, a co-founder.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You also get some cranky customers. In the last few months, the company has received an onslaught of complaints when the cost of a ride rose to as much as seven times the normal rate during a snowstorm and on New Year&#39;s Eve.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;One of the things we&#39;ve learned,&#39;&#39; Mr. Kalanick said, &#39;&#39;is that the more crisply you deliver the message to the customer and the more you set expectations ahead of time, the more you get to a place where there&#39;s no issue with it.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Uber&#39;s prices are controlled by an algorithm -- technology that is increasingly available to even the smallest enterprises. Craig Clark, for example, sells more than 2,600 items -- vintage china, bras, house numbers -- on a variety of online marketplaces. Two years ago, he was collecting $2,000 a month in revenue from his sale of house numbers on Amazon.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Six months into it, my sales went down all of the sudden,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Amazon went out and got a wholesale account and started selling the numbers themselves. So you&#39;re not just competing against other sellers, you&#39;re also competing against Amazon.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Clark had been laid off from his job as an analyst for a telecom company outside Philadelphia, so his online retail ventures had become his only source of income. Like many Amazon sellers, he started re-pricing items manually, but found the process wildly time-consuming. And mistakenly pricing a Jenga game at $13.99, instead of $23.99, once cost him $1,200.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then, he learned of FeedVisor, which makes re-pricing software. &#39;&#39;You tell them what the item cost you, the commission you pay to Amazon, and your highest and lowest price,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Clark, whose annual revenue is</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">approximately $500,000. &#39;&#39;FeedVisor then algorithmically decides the best price within your parameters and what everyone else is selling at.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company, one of many that sells re-pricing software, charges 1 percent of sales and provides a dashboard that lets sellers analyze sales and profits. Using FeedVisor last summer, Mr. Clark said his &#39;&#39;sales on Coobie bras went up 25 percent almost overnight.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FeedVisor reduced the price on the bras, which he was selling for between $19 and $23, by $2 or more to make them more competitive. That reduced his profit margin, Mr. Clark said, to 37 percent from 39 percent -- but increased his volume. The software also produced sales increases on other items of from 15 to 40 percent, he said, and helped him unload stale inventory, such as a pallet of pots and pans. &#39;&#39;I hadn&#39;t sold one in six months,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Clark, &#39;&#39;and I got rid of them in four days.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Restaurants, too, are using innovative pricing strategies. In September 2012, Groupon acquired a restaurant reservation engine, Savored, and has since integrated it into a new high-end division called Groupon Reserve. Instead of offering customers, say, $50 off a meal as traditional daily deals do, Savored lets restaurants offer customers a percentage off an entire meal in return for dining at a specified time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cacio e Vino, a Sicilian restaurant based in Manhattan, has been using the app for two years, said Christine Ehlert, the manager. &#39;&#39;On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, we offer a certain number of tables for a 40 percent discount,&#39;&#39; she said. Wednesday and Thursday diners may get 30 percent off through the app and customers who make reservations for between 5 and 7 p.m. on Friday and Saturday get a 25 percent discount.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ms. Ehlert said that she initially worried whether the discounting might damage her brand. &#39;&#39;But since we only offer a limited amount of discounted tables at certain times,&#39;&#39; she said, &#39;&#39;I feel that we can explain to people that it&#39;s a way to drive new business to us in off hours.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cacio e Vino pays Groupon a flat fee of $2.50 per diner. &#39;&#39;The nice thing is that if it seems we&#39;re going to be too busy,&#39;&#39; Ms. Ehlert said, &#39;&#39;I can call our rep at Savored and close out the deal.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before using Savored, she said, the restaurant typically had $800 in sales on Mondays and Tuesdays. &#39;&#39;Now, it&#39;s between $1,200 and $1,500,&#39;&#39; she said, with a profit margin on the discounted customers that is about half that of the full-price customers. She said slightly fewer than half of the restaurant&#39;s discounted customers come back, typically for another discounted meal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Frank and Rhonda Duffy run Duffy Realty of Atlanta, one of a growing number of real estate agencies trying new pricing strategies. The Duffys charge an upfront listing fee of $500 and one third of 1 percent when a house sells. According to Zillow, the agency has about 800 active listings and had more than 1,400 sales in the last 12 months. Mr. Duffy said the agency&#39;s 2013 revenue was $5.3 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the reduced fee, the Duffys offer limited service. The firm adds homes to the local Multiple Listing Service, as well as on Zillow and Trulia, supplies sellers with a 60-point, do-it-yourself marketing guide, rents lockboxes for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$100, and charges $94 for a home to be professionally photographed. One of the firm&#39;s four listing specialists is likely to come to take your information. Then, a team of specialists, including client services representatives, buyer&#39;s agents and contract negotiators, moves buyers and sellers through the sale process.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To provide an incentive to agents from other firms to bring buyers, the Duffys encourage sellers to offer the buyer&#39;s agents commissions of 3 percent or even 4 percent. Most sellers do it, he said, because they still come out ahead. On the sale of a $300,000 home, for example, a traditional agent might split a 6 percent commission, or $18,000, with a buyer&#39;s agent. A seller listing with Duffy will pay a $1,520 commission ($500 plus one third of 1 percent, or $1,020), plus 3 percent ($9,000) or 4 percent ($12,000) for a buyer&#39;s agent, or a total of between</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$10,520 and $13,520.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The pricing model does not suit all sellers. &#39;&#39;The danger is you&#39;re not getting the advice and guidance,&#39;&#39; said Frank</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">S. Alexander, a real estate professor at Emory Law School. &#39;&#39;What do you with inspection results, or during the due diligence period, or in a contract negotiation?&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For experienced sellers, or in a particularly hot market, that may not matter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Craig Clark, who sells items on Amazon and ships 40 to 100 packages daily, uses special software to constantly gauge demand and the competition, and adjusts his prices accordingly.

Two years ago, he was collecting $2,000 a month in revenue from the sale of house numbers on Amazon. “Six months into it, my sales went down all of the sudden,” he said. “Amazon went out and got a wholesale account and started selling the numbers themselves. So you’re not just competing against other sellers, you’re also competing against Amazon.”</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://feedvisor.com/" class="s1" target="_blank">As Donna Fenn writes, Mr. Clark had been laid off from his job as an analyst for a telecom company outside of Philadelphia, so his online retail ventures had become his only source of income. Like many Amazon sellers, he started repricing items manually but found the process wildly time-consuming. Then, he learned of </a>FeedVisor<span class="p">, which makes repricing software.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“You tell them what the item cost you, the commission you pay to Amazon and your highest and lowest price,” said Mr. Clark, whose annual revenue is about $500,000. “FeedVisor then algorithmically decides the best price within your parameters and what everyone else is selling at.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Please read Mr. Clark’s example as well as the others in the article and then tell us what you think. Have you tried anything similar? If so, how did it work?</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/the-best-small-business-posts-of-2013/" class="a" target="_blank">The Best Small-Business Posts of </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/the-best-small-business-posts-of-2013/" target="_blank">2013</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/study-suggests-online-sales-tax-bill-could-leave-billions-untaxed/" class="a" target="_blank">Study Suggests Online Sales Tax Bill Could Leave Billions </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/study-suggests-online-sales-tax-bill-could-leave-billions-untaxed/" target="_blank">Untaxed</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/is-affiliate-marketing-worth-the-risk/" class="a" target="_blank">Is Affiliate Marketing Worth the </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/is-affiliate-marketing-worth-the-risk/" target="_blank">Risk?</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/today-in-small-business-gloomy-numbers/" class="a" target="_blank">Today in Small Business: Gloomy </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/today-in-small-business-gloomy-numbers/" target="_blank">Numbers</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/can-you-attract-top-sales-representatives-if-you-dont-pay-sales-commissions/" class="a" target="_blank">Can You Attract Top Sales Representatives if You Don’t Pay Sales </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/can-you-attract-top-sales-representatives-if-you-dont-pay-sales-commissions/" target="_blank">Commissions?</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Craig Clark uses software to control the pricing of the goods he sells online. | Laura Pedrick for The New York Times</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020140122ea1m0025u</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_023.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark40">BITS</a><a name="bookmark41">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">IBM Has Big Plans for Investments in the Cloud</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By QUENTIN HARDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">612 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">20 January 2014 The New York Times NYTF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Edition - Final 4</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IBM is moving rapidly on its plans to spend heavily on cloud computing. It expects to spend $1.2 billion this year on increasing the number and quality of computing centers it has worldwide.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The move reflects the speed at which the business of renting a lot of computing power via the Internet is replacing the conventional business of selling mainframe computers, computer servers, and associated hardware and software. Champions of cloud computing cite both lower costs and faster deployment as the reasons for the shift.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;This is a key growth area for IBM,&#39;&#39; said Erich Clementi, senior vice president of IBM Global Technology Services. &#39;&#39;We are building out a global footprint.&#39;&#39; In addition to selling raw computing and data storage capabilities, he said, IBM plans to offer over 150 software and software development products in its cloud. Among the products is Watson, an advanced cognitive computing framework. Last week, IBM&#39;s chief executive, Virginia Rometty, announced a new business group inside IBM for Watson.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;This is a series of investments that started years ago,&#39;&#39; Mr. Clementi said. &#39;&#39;Under Gini, we&#39;re doubling down.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One reason for IBM&#39;s urgency is the rapid growth of competitors, in particular Amazon Web Services, but also Google and Microsoft. All these cloud providers, which offer a service that eats into IBM&#39;s traditional revenue, have said they will spend at least $1 billion annually on cloud computing for the foreseeable future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last year, IBM paid $2 billion to buy Softlayer, a cloud company with 13 data centers. IBM already had 12 data centers of its own, in the United States and overseas, for a total of 25. The smallest of these contains over 16,000 servers, and most are significantly larger. By the end of 2014, the company plans to have 40 centers in 13 countries scattered over five continents. In addition to building computing centers in mainland China and the Middle East, IBM will build two facilities in the United States specifically designed to handle government workloads.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The China and government initiatives, in particular, seem aimed at Amazon. Amazon came into China only in December, where it has to be to attract Chinese businesses. Over much of last year, IBM contested a $600 million deal between Amazon and the Central Intelligence Agency for cloud services before withdrawing its protest in October. IBM is likely to offer specialized clouds that meet health care and financial regulations at some point in the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As all the competitors begin to jockey for contracts from start-ups and established businesses, each is expected to bring its own relative strengths to bear. For IBM, Mr. Clementi said, this would include the ability to integrate existing computing facilities with an external cloud; stronger management and privacy controls; and a deep understanding of business processes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I don&#39;t encounter Google outside of their traditional work,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;They aren&#39;t delivering the ability to deliver a mobile application that can hook into a general ledger. Sometimes I run into Amazon.&#39;&#39; Referring to more traditional competitors, he said, &#39;&#39;With Hewlett-Packard, I don&#39;t see the reach or the breadth.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">H.P. has also been running a cloud business, and in November the company announced with Salesforce.com a deal to run Salesforce&#39;s cloud-based software on H.P. machines.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Virginia Rometty, IBM&#39;s chief, said this month that IBM would invest more than $1 billion in a new group related to Watson.

Wednesday’s vote does not affect the vast majority of the 1,500 packers and shippers at the distribution center, one of more than 40 Amazon warehouses across the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The workers at Amazon faced intense pressure from managers and anti-union consultants hired to suppress this organizing drive,” said John Carr, a spokesman for the union.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Our employees have made it clear that they prefer a direct connection with Amazon,” said Mary Osako, a company spokeswoman. “This direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the wants and needs of our employees.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has vigorously opposed unionization by its employees, saying that it has competitive wages and an open-door policy that encourages employees to bring their concerns directly to management.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Officials of the machinists’ union said safety and promotions were among the main concerns of the Delaware technical workers.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/business/workers-of-amazon-divergent.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Amazon, based in Seattle, has handily beaten back previous rumblings in favor of unionization in the United States, but last year hundreds of its workers in Germany </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/business/workers-of-amazon-divergent.html" class="a" target="_blank">went on strike</a> <span style=" color: #000;">as part of a long and continuing dispute over wages.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020140116ea1g000mh</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_025.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark44">Business Day; Media &amp; Advertising</a><a name="bookmark45">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Holiday Sales Slide 60% at Barnes &amp; Noble Nook Unit, Pointing to Tests for Chief</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By JULIE BOSMAN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">698 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">10 January 2014 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In late 2009, Barnes &amp; Noble introduced its first e-reader, the Nook, and within a relatively short time had picked up 25 percent of the e-book market, slicing into Amazon’s dominance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now those gains seem to have faded. On Thursday, Barnes &amp; Noble, the nation’s last remaining major bookstore chain, said that it had steep sales declines in its digital division during the holiday period, continuing a steady decline for a unit that was once the centerpiece of its growth strategy.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/press_releases/1_9_14_2014_holiday_sales.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Revenue in the Nook division, which includes digital content and devices, </a><a href="http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/press_releases/1_9_14_2014_holiday_sales.html" class="a" target="_blank">was $125 million,</a> <span style=" color: #000;">a 60.5 percent drop compared with the nine-week holiday period a year earlier. Barnes &amp; Noble executives said their total share of the e-book market had fallen to 20 percent.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The drop-off underscores the significant challenges facing the new chief executive, Michael P. Huseby, a company insider who was appointed to the post on Wednesday. He said Barnes &amp; Noble was determined to find a way to reverse the losses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Our objective is to stop the decline and turn it around so we get back into growth mode,” Mr. Huseby said in a telephone interview. “Obviously the loss was big. So that’s why our focus is on rationalizing the business.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The news was much cheerier from the brick-and-mortar side of Barnes &amp; Noble, with its 673 retail stores. Bookstore sales decreased only 6.6 percent compared with the previous year, to $1.1 billion. Mr. Huseby said he was “very happy” with the company’s performance in retail bookstores, which have set aside space in recent years for toys, educational games, greeting cards and other gift items.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mitchell S. Klipper, the chief executive of Barnes &amp; Noble’s retail division, said he did not expect any significant changes ahead in the bookstores. “You’re not going to see any major departures in the near future in our stores,” he said. “We’re happy with what we have.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The losses in the Nook division reflect Barnes &amp; Noble’s decreasing digital ambitions, as it declined to release a new color tablet in 2013. The bookseller has said it will pull back from trying to compete in the crowded tablet market against big companies like Amazon and Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asked to explain the decline in digital sales, Mr. Huseby said that Barnes &amp; Noble was fighting intense competition from Amazon and Apple and deep discounts on books from other retailers that influenced Barnes &amp; Noble’s own pricing. Analysts suggested that the Justice Department’s lawsuit against publishers, which resulted in allowing retailers to discount e-books more freely, might have contributed to Barnes &amp; Noble’s troubles.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Huseby, previously the president of Barnes &amp; Noble and chief executive of Nook Media, added that Barnes &amp; Noble was looking into forming partnerships with other device manufacturers, but that no plans had been completed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jack W. Perry, a publishing consultant, said that Barnes &amp; Noble’s position had become precarious. “They need to get their act together now,” he said. “They need to do something now before the Nook is no longer viable.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble has sold more than 10 million Nook devices since its debut in 2009.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The results, which cover the nine-week period that ended Dec. 28, are likely to further unsettle publishers, authors and agents who have fretted about Barnes &amp; Noble’s stability for years. Since Borders went out of</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">business in 2011, Barnes &amp; Noble is the last significant bookstore chain in the country.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble appointed one of its top executives on Wednesday to fill the post of chief executive, a job that has been vacant since William Lynch Jr. abruptly resigned from the company in July.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Michael P. Huseby, the president of Barnes &amp; Noble and chief executive of its digital division, Nook Media, will become the chief executive effective immediately, a statement from Barnes &amp; Noble said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His appointment comes as Barnes &amp; Noble, the nation’s largest bookstore chain, continues its struggles to find its footing. It has invested heavily in its digital division in the hopes of competing with Amazon, building a line of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-readers and tablets and devoting significant floor space in its stores to their sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But sales have been disappointing and the company has recently failed to make headway in gaining e-book market share from Amazon. Last year, the company signaled it would scale back its efforts in the digital device market, where it failed to gain traction against powerful competitors like Amazon and Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Mr. Lynch stepped down last summer, Barnes &amp; Noble, the nation’s largest bookstore chain, made no immediate moves to replace him. Instead it made Mr. Huseby head of the digital division, while Leonard Riggio, the company’s chairman, largely focused on the retail bookstores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In November, Barnes &amp; Noble said that its revenue declined 8 percent, to $1.7 billion, in the quarter that ended Oct. 26.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Huseby brings a largely financial background to the role of chief executive. He joined the company in March 2012 as its chief financial officer, and had previously worked as the chief financial officer of Cablevision.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Although a relative newcomer to the retail book business, he has quickly developed a comprehensive understanding of the unique opportunities and challenges the company faces, and he has a vision for the future in which I am in complete accord,” Mr. Riggio said in a statement. “Mike also has a passion for bookselling, which makes him a perfect fit for this job.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barnes &amp; Noble also said on Wednesday that it had closed one of its remaining bookstores in Manhattan, a store on Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron district. Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &amp; Noble, said it was a college bookstore whose sales have been in decline for the last decade. Much of its business had already been transferred to campus stores operated by Barnes &amp; Noble College.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With sales of print books flat or in decline, publishing executives say they are more concerned than ever about the viability of Barnes &amp; Noble, the last major bookstore chain standing. Borders went out of business in 2011, taking with it more than 650 stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While publishers have experimented with promoting their books on social media and elsewhere, many fear that display space in brick-and-mortar stores is not easily replaced.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Michael P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Fab.com, an online retailer selling affordable high design, seemed last year as if it could be the next Amazon. Just a few months later, however, it looked as if it could become the next Pets.com.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Big-name venture capitalists, including the Andreessen Horowitz firm, poured money into the company over the past few years, lured by its startling growth rate. After raising some $170 million in venture funding, Fab accepted an additional $150 million in June, a round that valued the company at $1 billion and vaulted it into the club of billion-dollar technology start-ups that include Snapchat, Pinterest, Evernote, Spotify and Dropbox.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But by the end of the summer, Fab had fallen from that elite. Amid financial trouble, it fired hundreds of employees. A company co-founder and the chief operating officer left the company. Its valuation sank below $1 billion, leaving some investors with shares worth less then they had invested.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rise and stumbles of Fab demonstrate how swiftly the fortunes of start-ups can change. At the company’s giddy high point, it also illustrated why some billion-dollar-plus valuations have raised concerns of a new dot-com bubble.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Predicting what’s undervalued and what’s overvalued is fabulously hard,’’ said Josh Lerner, a professor of entrepreneurship at the Harvard Business School. ‘‘It’s a trope to see a young, highly valued company and say it’s wrong, but sometimes it is.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fab declined to comment for this article.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The growth of the billion-dollar club has eclipsed the exuberance of more than a decade ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the three years from 2011 through 2013, there were at least 34 investments that valued companies at $1 billion or more, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, compared with 16 from 1998 to 2000.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Yet it is more than a speculative frenzy that is driving up the valuations of these companies. A number of changes in the capital markets, the venture capital industry and the public equity markets have conspired to make it easier than ever for unproven start-ups to be valued at $1 billion or more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For one, the stock and merger markets have demonstrated that many companies’ high-flying valuations are justified. Facebook’s stock has surged after its early stumbles. Newly public companies like Twitter are performing well. And Instagram and Tumblr both sold for more than $1 billion each, emboldening venture capitalists.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘A number of high-profile companies in the social media space have been successful,’’ Mr. Lerner said. ‘‘It’s creating a feedback loop.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another factor driving up valuations is the 38 percent rise last year in the Nasdaq composite index, which is heavy with technology companies. For venture investors eager to find the next big thing, the healthy stock market acts as a green light to keep pouring money into private companies that might go public or get sold.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘There’s always this long and almost irrational exuberance tied to the enthusiasm, excitement and growth of a company when the economy is doing well,’’ said Jayshree Ullal, chief executive of Arista Networks, a cloud networking company reportedly valued near $2.5 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What is more, the availability of cheap financing for companies and investors, which has helped buoy the stock market, is allowing investors to easily finance deals and borrow money.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Pension funds and endowments are putting more money into venture funds. In the third quarter, venture capital firms raised $4.1 billion, an increase of 28 percent from the previous quarter, according to the National Venture Capital Association.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And with so much cash to deploy, venture funds are competing with one another to invest the money, a process that often drives up valuations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the ride-sharing service Lyft was seeking to raise a new round of financing last year, many firms, including Greylock Partners, were interested in investing. But before they could offer Lyft any cash, Andreessen Horowitz swooped in with an offer that Lyft could not refuse, according to people briefed on the situation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Andreessen Horowitz is known in Silicon Valley for such tactics, having had success with companies like Facebook, Twitter and Skype. According to CB Insights, which tracks venture investing, the average size of the firm’s investment was substantially higher than those of rivals New Enterprise Associates and Greylock.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Andreessen Horowitz is not alone. In the third quarter, venture capital firms invested $7.8 billion, an increase of 12 percent from the previous quarter, according to the venture capital association and PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The competition is especially tough when it comes to later-stage investments in the most admired billion-dollar tech companies, a group that includes such companies as Square, Box and Uber.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And the fight is becoming more fierce as new investors jockey to compete with venture funds. Competition from later-stage investors like Meritech Capital and Institutional Venture Partners and hedge funds like Tiger Global and Valiant Capital Management has driven up valuations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These funds expect lower returns than venture capitalists, so they take less risk by investing in more mature companies that are safer bets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘If you’ve got funds and you need to basically deploy pretty big chunks of capital, wouldn’t you rather invest in things that seem like a sure thing?’’ said Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures. In a widely read blog post on tech companies worth more than $1 billion, Ms. Lee called the group the ‘‘Unicorn Club.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last May, Evernote, a company that makes a productivity app, raised money that drove the valuation significantly higher. Just seven months later, interest from Valiant, a hedge fund based in San Francisco that also invested in Dropbox, and the AGC Equity Partners’ affiliate Capital, elevated the valuation to a reported $2 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For those venture firms that aren’t able to invest in the top companies, the inclination is to spread out their investments among a broad pool of companies, many of which are derivative.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the deals site Groupon was thriving, for example, big investors including Amazon poured money into rival LivingSocial. For a time, the company was valued at more than $1.5 billion. But in February, LivingSocial took</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$110 million in new funding at a lower valuation, a so-called down round.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘These funds have a lot of money and push money out into whatever looks hot,’’ said Alexander Ljungqvist, professor of finance at New York University. ‘‘It’s like throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With so much cash in the bank, many companies that in previous cycles might have been prompted to sell or go public can now stay private longer — a strategy they saw Facebook use with success.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘That’s why you’re seeing LinkedIn, Twitter, etc., going out at $20 billion valuations instead of a billion like eBay or Amazon,’’ said John Backus, founder of New Atlantic Ventures and a member of the National Venture Capital Association board. ‘‘There’s a lot more value accruing to the private investors.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And the rise in so-called secondary offerings, which allow executives and early employees to sell some of their shares when the company is still private, is driving up valuations as new investors compete for a limited number of shares on the secondary market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some find recent valuations unreasonable.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I don’t know any other way to value a company than to look at its future cash flow and compare it to current cash flow,’’ said Brian Hamilton, the chairman of Sageworks, which analyzes the financial strength of private companies. ‘‘Where we are today, I don’t see where the values are coming from based upon any judicious or even very optimistic view of a company’s future cash flow and revenue.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But many investors contend that young companies will one day justify their eye-popping valuations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘Valuations are never a reflection of today’s performance, it’s a reflection of the future opportunity,’’ Ms. Ullal of Arista Networks said. ‘‘Most of these companies grow into their valuations nicely and those that don’t fall by the wayside.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And technology boosters note that the market for Internet companies is larger than it was 15 years ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘In the last cycle, there were barely 500 million people online, and they were all on 56k modems,’’ said David Lee of SV Angel, an early-stage investor. ‘‘By 2015, there will be five billion people with a supercomputer in their hands.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, to some, Fab and other companies that attain high valuations are a sign that too much money is chasing too few good ideas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This is a drama that has played out many times before,’’ said Mr. Lerner of Harvard. ‘‘The music inevitably stops at a certain point.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020140106ea1600004</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_028.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark50">The Media Equation</a><a name="bookmark51">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business Day; Media &amp; Advertising</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Print Starts to Settle Into Its Niches</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID CARR</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,302 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 January 2014 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2014.

He decided to edit the thousands of reviews that had accrued over the last 10 years into a self-published print catalog — also called “Cool Tools” — which he would then sell for $39.99.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So, to review, his idea was to manufacture a floppy 472-page catalog that would weigh 4.5 pounds, full of buying advice that had already appeared free on the web, essentially turning weightless pixels into bulky bundles of atoms. To make it happen, he crowdsourced designs from all over the world, found a printer in China and then arranged for shipping and distribution. It all seemed a little quixotic and, well, beside the point.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Except the first printing of 10,000 copies, just in time for Christmas, sold out immediately, a second printing of 12,000 will go on sale at Amazon next week and a third printing of 20,000 copies is underway.

Print continues to be a remarkable technology, if not as lucrative as it used to be, with its own durable glories. I was just on vacation with five women — I was related to all of them, so don’t get any ideas</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">— and watched as a single paperback of<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/books/wild-by-cheryl-strayed-a-walkabout-of-reinvention.html?pagewanted=all" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/books/wild-by-cheryl-strayed-a-walkabout-of-reinvention.html?pagewanted=all" class="a" target="_blank">Cheryl Strayed’s magnificent “Wild”</a> was passed around, discussed and shared. I’ve never seen that kind of interaction over an e-book. And at Christmas, I spent time showing my daughter’s boyfriend “Cool Tools,” with its advice on hitchhiking, finding the most practical stapler, renting a bulldozer or building an igloo. With a frantic, jam-packed design and improbable juxtapositions, it’s a big, sprawling wonder of a book — half coffee-table tome and half Sears catalog of old. Having it in my hands made me happy.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cool Tools, both the website and the book, is not about getting more things, or expensive gadgets, but about finding the right stuff. For me, it was the $9 AccuSharp Knife Sharpener, remarkably useful because it makes something I already have — an indifferent set of kitchen knives — much more valuable. “Cool Tools” is an artifact about other artifacts, but it is not pro-consumption — in fact, there is an ecstatic review about a book that extols the benefits of decluttering your life. At its best, ”Cool Tools” is a guide to getting that one true thing — a device, a piece of clothing, a tool — that will make daily life better.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As practitioners of consumption, Americans lead poorly edited lives. We end up with basements and attics full of items that looked amazing in the store or online, but that lost their sparkle once they left the Bubble Wrap. “Cool Tools” fits into a growing wave of the so-called maker culture, a movement toward building real, actual things with our own two hands.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Kelly, who is often both grandiose and correct in his pronouncements, says he believes that a “third industrial revolution is stirring,” adding that the stuff in his book is “aimed at small groups, decentralized communities, the do-it-yourselfer, and the self-educated.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“These are tools to make us better humans,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Community workshops, with an array of tools and equipment for building things in metal and wood, are springing up and offering membership plans the way gyms do. Mr. Kelly points out that a new service allows people to drive their car to the airport and then rent it out while they are gone. The growing possibilities of 3-D printing are further democratizing the manufacturing process.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Of course, believing we can consume our way to a better future is a very American impulse, but Mr. Kelly argues that “access to something is going to be far more important than actually owning it.” He points to digital books and says that owning them will seem passé pretty quickly, predicting that Amazon and others will soon move to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">all-access memberships like Netflix.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“I am trying to maximize the number of great technologies that people have with which to express their creativity, but at the same time, I am trying to minimize the number of tools in my own life,” he said. “I think that function, of choosing what you actually need and can use, is going to get more and more complicated.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The book, he says, “is not a rejection of digital technology. We are just in the early days of what e-books are going to be and no one says that it is going to be a flat, one-size fits all device in the future. But for now, print seemed like the best way to go with this project.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It wasn’t easy. When he was getting the book printed, he received a call asking if his office had a loading dock. Mr. Kelly, who works from home, said hopefully, “I have a garage.” That, he was told, would not suffice, so he arranged for a book distributor to take delivery.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Having spent much of his life online, Mr. Kelly is suddenly living in a very physical world. “Right now, I have 70 metric tons of books headed my way on a ship,” he said. “I had to figure out where they were all going.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Email: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter: @carr2n</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Kevin Kelly self-published a collection of reviews accrued from a website over the years, and it sold extremely well.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020140106ea16000p4</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_029.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark52">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark53">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Ecuadorean Navy Delivers for Amazon Chief</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">303 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 January 2014 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2014 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CORRECTION APPENDEDThere&#39;s something brilliant, but also insidious, about services like Amazon Prime, where you don&#39;t have to reach for your credit card to pay. Spending is painless.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Credit cards have separated us from our cash. Services like Amazon Prime, iTunes and others have separated us from our cards. And once we can pay more easily with our smartphones, consumers will experience yet another degree of separation. All of this means that consumers need to work a bit harder to &#39;&#39;feel&#39;&#39; what they&#39;re spending -- and keep track of it. Behavioral scientists will tell you what you intuitively know: Willpower alone will take you only so far, and restrictive budgets eventually fail. But this is the time of year when many people try to get a grip on their spending.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Look for structural solutions or things that change your environment so you don&#39;t need to be constantly vigilant,&#39;&#39; said Stephen Wendel, a behavioral social scientist at HelloWallet, which helps employers provide financial guidance to their workers. &#39;&#39;My favorite technology is the automatic transfer, so you don&#39;t see the money in your account.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are some new financial apps that try to acknowledge our innate weaknesses as humans, most of whom despise deprivation and keeping tabs on every last dollar spent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I spent the last week testing several cash management tools, including the newest apps targeting younger generations as well as improvements made by established services like Mint.com that still dominate the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A note of caution: To use most of these apps and services, which promise bank-level security, you need to be comfortable entrusting them with the passwords to your financial accounts. To analyze your spending, they need to collect and then ferry data about your income and transactional history into their programs; many rely on established players like Yodlee and Intuit for that plumbing and do not have the ability to move your money. I&#39;ve also listed a couple of more traditional, and more labor-intensive, options.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LEVEL MONEY Less than three months old, this app is intentionally simple: You can&#39;t create fancy charts that categorize every last dollar, nor does it wag a virtual finger to alert you when you&#39;ve spent too much on restaurants in the last month. Instead, it acts as a spending meter or a gas gauge: On the first of each month, it fills up with your estimated income based on your previous history; from that, the app automatically subtracts your recurring bills and a saving rate. (It suggests 7 percent). The app is available for iPhone and is coming soon for Android.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The money remaining is what you can spend, and the app breaks that down on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. The app is connected to all of your credit, debit and banking accounts, so it knows every time you make a transaction and adjusts the money meter accordingly. If you had a day of heavy spending, it will show that you have less to spend for the remainder of the month. &#39;&#39;What we wanted wasn&#39;t a budget, but the digital equivalent of opening up your wallet and seeing how much you have left,&#39;&#39; said Jake Fuentes, 27, Level&#39;s co-founder and chief executive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The idea, Mr. Fuentes said, is to focus on decisions in the here and now. It&#39;s that simple -- and probably far too simple for many people. The app is geared to people 18 to 35 who are most likely to have less complex financial lives.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can&#39;t add in your cash transactions and the app won&#39;t work as well for people with inconsistent income and expenses, but the company is working on adding features that will address those issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BILLGUARD This app started life as a security service that scanned users&#39; credit and debit charges for potentially erroneous or unauthorized transactions -- a service Target shoppers can surely appreciate now. But last summer, it added a spending analytics tool and personalized savings alerts. The spending feature gives you a snapshot of your monthly spending, though you need be a heavy credit and debit card user for the numbers to have meaning. Every time you swipe a card, the transaction is automatically categorized. It did a relatively good job with the two cards I connected.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The analytics are informative, but one-dimensional. You can compare spending across all accounts with the previous month. You can compare spending across all accounts with the prior month, but the app doesn&#39;t provide insights into spending relative to income. Those features and customizable alerts will be added in coming months. &#39;&#39;It will be looking out for you almost like the perfect accountant in the background, letting you live your life and when you go beyond a certain threshold it will let you know,&#39;&#39; said Yaron Samid, founder and chief executive. The company is also working on letting users add cash transactions, alerts when users are close to incurring an overdraft fee, and other analytics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The app, which is available for the iPhone and will serve Android in February, also searches the Web for coupons that you are most likely to use based on your past spending. The app works for two linked accounts, but there&#39;s a one-time charge of $9.99 for up to 10 accounts. Yodlee handles account aggregation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MINT For several years now, I have had an on-again, off-again relationship with Mint.com, the automated money-tracking service introduced in 2007 and acquired in 2009 by Intuit for $170 million. If you want to get a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">better sense of where your money is going, keep tabs on your net worth and chart it all with pie and bar charts for different time periods, then Mint is still the most comprehensive tool on the market. LearnVest, which offers a human financial planner if you want one, has a similarly robust free tool, which I&#39;ve reviewed in the past.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mint&#39;s budgeting tool sets up a starter budget for you -- based on up to three months&#39; spending history -- across various categories from groceries to mobile phones. You can add to the list and customize to your heart&#39;s content. If you spend more than you&#39;ve allotted, you can set it up to receive an email or a text message. LearnVest has its own budgeting tool, which also provides some guideposts: You should spend no more than half of your income on essentials and no more than 30 percent on lifestyle expenses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mint users, estimated at two million by the company, can now track their spending, income and net worth via the mobile app, but people will inevitably find something that doesn&#39;t quite work for them. The app requires maintenance because its categorization is not flawless. It still irks me that Mint refuses to learn that the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">target-date mutual fund in my 401(k) is not Target, the retailer. The app is available for Android and Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">YOU NEED A BUDGET This budgeting program requires you to enter or import everything manually, though much of that can be done by syncing the program with its app. If you are reluctant to hand over passwords to your financial accounts, this could be a good option. You can give it a test run for 34 days. After that, it will cost $60 for the program.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The idea behind its method: Give every dollar a job. The program does seem geared for dedicated, disciplined self-starters who don&#39;t mind spending a chunk of time each week going over their spending. Tim Maurer, a financial planner in Hunt Valley, Md., makes time for it, and feels he&#39;s better connected to his family&#39;s spending patterns as a result. &#39;&#39;I do still use Mint occasionally, just to act as a one-stop dashboard of all my financial accounts, but it&#39;s really only casual use,&#39;&#39; Mr. Maurer said. &#39;&#39;Y.N.A.B. I use religiously, going through our household&#39;s weekly spending every Saturday morning. I load all my transactions and review my balances through the software on my laptop -- and then my wife and I reference the Y.N.A.B. iPhone app throughout the week.&#39;&#39; The program and its apps are available for Apple and Android.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MVELOPES This program tries to modernize your parents&#39; or grandparents&#39; envelope system, where you allocate money to various envelopes for different categories, like food. The idea is that when there&#39;s no money left, you either stop spending in that category or pull money from another envelope. The tool, which is available for Android and iPhone, automatically connects to your accounts with its own technology, though you have the option of entering transactions manually. While I found the envelope concept alluring, I didn&#39;t find the service at all intuitive and could not connect a Citibank account to the system. Creating up to 25 envelopes and adding four accounts is free, and includes a free phone session with a money coach (the service sells these sessions, too, but they aren&#39;t necessarily with financial planners or accountants). Unlimited service costs $9.95 monthly.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OTHER APPS AND SERVICES Dozens of other apps will help you track your money, from Spendee ($1.99 on an iPhone; it is coming to Android soon) to Bdgt ($1.99), both of which have been featured by the Apple app store. But they are really just electronic notebooks, requiring manual entry, that make tracking your spending easy to categorize.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you just want to raise your consciousness for a few weeks or months, you might try something like Spendee, which is easy to use and pleasing to look at, and can back up data to iCloud and export it if you wish.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even Jim Bruene, founder of the NetBanker blog who tracks innovations in personal finance technology, can appreciate old-school methods for a period of time. &#39;&#39;Diligently hand-entering every expense for a month or two can be eye-opening, at least for the more short-term scenario where you are trying to get a handle on what&#39;s happening with all your cash,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">But that&#39;ll require some willpower. Correction: January 8, 2014, Wednesday</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Your Money column on Saturday, about apps to help budgeters keep track of spending, gave outdated information on the BillGuard app&#39;s availability for the iPhone. It is available now; it will not be out in February. The column also misstated the price of the Bdgt app. It costs $1.99; it is not free.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Level Money&#39;s smartphone application, left and center, is aimed at adults under 35. It subtracts expenditures and indicates what&#39;s left. BillGuard, right, shows spending by amount and location.

Although the album could not be purchased and downloaded as a whole, all 12 of its songs could be purchased individually, Billboard reported. Except in the case of the title track, which has been available since Nov. 25, the loophole was closed quickly, but the album appeared on several file-sharing sites within hours.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The album, which is due out on Jan. 14, is a hard-driven 56-minute collection of oddities. Included are several new studio recordings of favorites from Mr. Springsteen&#39;s concert sets, with Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine joining Mr. Springsteen on guitar, along with earlier studio outtakes including Mr. Springsteen&#39;s longtime saxophonist, Clarence Clemons, who died in 2011. The track list includes no fewer than three covers -- unusual on an album by Mr. Springsteen -- and a weighty, electrified version of &#39;&#39;The Ghost of Tom Joad.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All rights reserved Ahem. Please find your seats.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is time again for DealBook’s annual “Closing Dinner,” at which we toast and roast the world of finance and corporations — and look back at the year that was.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This year’s table assignments were a bit trickier than in years past. Eric Holder, the United States attorney general, asked to sit next to Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase to “catch up on some unfinished business.” Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, asked to sit next to Mr. Holder as well but also “within earshot of Steven Cohen.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then, out of the blue, Carl Icahn, the activist investor, tweeted that he hoped to sit next to Tim Cook of Apple. Mr. Cook, presumably having tired of Mr. Icahn’s one-track conversations, replied with “#SeatCarlWithBillAckman.” We might sell tickets to that table. We sent an invitation to Jeff Bezos, but U.P.S. didn’t deliver it in time over the holiday. If only Amazon’s new drones were up and flying.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Edward Snowden, who could not leave Russia for obvious reasons, sent his regrets along with a note he asked me to give to Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook: “Those emails with your mother before the holidays were really cute.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s also nice to see Elon Musk, who just arrived, of course, in his Tesla. He has offered to cook dessert, which he promises will be a surprise flambé. (Rimshot, please!)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And Jamie, before I forget, a nice young gentleman from China asked me to pass you his résumé, but I’m not sure who his parents are. Please don’t hold it against him. (Ouch! I jest.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A big thanks to the Winklevoss twins, who were kind enough to pay for tonight’s festivities in Bitcoin. Dick Costolo of Twitter also chipped in by paying with his company’s stock. As a token of our thanks, there’s bubble gum and tulips in all of your gift bags.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Finally, before we begin the official toasts and roasts, we are lucky to have Pope Francis here, especially given his recent critical comments about capitalism and those “wielding economic power.” We sat him next to Donald Trump.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, in all seriousness:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SIMPLY, THANK YOU Ben Bernanke: Please take a bow as you prepare to depart the Federal Reserve as chairman. Everyone in the nation owes you a huge thanks. You have done an extraordinary job helping the country get out of a deep recession with little help from gridlocked officials in Washington. We still have a long way to go, but considering the economic abyss we were facing five years ago — and the unconventional steps you have taken over the years to reduce the unemployment rate — it is a minor miracle we are not in worse shape.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your first steps this month to taper the government’s bond-buying program appear to be working. Of course, there’s an argument to be made that some of your easy-money policies may have exacerbated inequality in the nation — most of the wealth generated over the last couple of years has accrued to those already with assets like homes or stocks — but it surely kept the economy from collapsing.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And if you ever think your actions weren’t appreciated enough, just think of the blunt bumper sticker that former Representative Barney Frank once joked he was going to buy, effectively saying: Things Would Have Been Worse Without Me. Your successor, Janet Yellen, has some big shoes to fill.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WORST C.E.O. OF THE YEAR This year’s prize for worst chief executive was a tie between Ron Johnson, who was ousted from J. C. Penney, and Thorsten Heins, who exited BlackBerry. Admittedly, both executives had tough turnaround assignments when they got the jobs. But both found novel ways to run their companies into the ground at breakneck speeds.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Johnson, who made his name building Apple’s retail business and liked to not-so-subtly compare himself to Steve Jobs, made the early — and patently wrong — decision to jettison Penney’s longtime customers in favor of catering to more upscale customers who never showed up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Heins’s reign at BlackBerry was doomed from almost the first week he took the job when he declared, “There’s nothing wrong with the company as it exists right now,” even though anyone with an iPhone or Android sensed trouble. And then, rather than introduce the first model of BlackBerry’s next-generation phone with a keyboard — the reason so many of its customers were loyal for so long — he introduced a keyboardless version.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BANK C.E.O. OF THE YEAR It’s not very popular to crown a “C.E.O. of the Year” these days, and even less so the chief of a big bank, but James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, deserves credit for turning around an institution that only a couple of years ago was on the verge of being written off. Mr. Gorman, a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">straight-talking former consultant from Australia, got the bank out of its riskiest businesses, was perhaps the most vocal about tamping down compensation and refocused the firm on the staid, perhaps even boring, business of wealth management.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the process, he may have taken Morgan Stanley out of competing head-to-head with the likes of Goldman Sachs — an assumption he would challenge and some old-timers would lament — but the firm’s turnaround has been a success.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company’s stock has jumped 61 percent this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE GANG THAT COULDN’T SHOOT STRAIGHT FINALLY DID One of the refrains we hear again and again from the business community is that Washington is creating unneeded uncertainty with its series of debt default threats and government shutdowns.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s not clear that praise deserves to be heaped on those who simply do their jobs, but since it seemingly happens so rarely in Washington, praise is in order to both Paul Ryan and Patty Murray for reaching a mini-budget deal without blowing up the economy again. It wasn’t a grand bargain, but it was a step in the right direction.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/icahn-tries-new-tack-to-stir-things-up-at-apple-his-own-web-site/" class="a" target="_blank">Icahn Amps Up Pressure on Apple, but His Stake Limits His </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/icahn-tries-new-tack-to-stir-things-up-at-apple-his-own-web-site/" target="_blank">Leverage</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/icahn-reviews-dinner-on-twitter/" class="a" target="_blank">Icahn Reviews Dinner on </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/icahn-reviews-dinner-on-twitter/" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Raise your glasses to the year that was in the world of finance. | Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times Document NYTB000020131231e9cu0005m</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_033.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark60">BU</a><a name="bookmark61">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">WELCOME TO MY RAIN FOREST</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By EDWARD LEWINE</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">31 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">29 December 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New York Times Abstracts NYTA</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

In a quote in its press release, Jeffrey Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, said: “Amazon Prime membership continues to grow, and we now have tens of millions of members worldwide.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Prime is the company’s $79-a-year membership service, which provides people with free two-day shipping and a list of other benefits. By all estimates, it has been a big hit for the company. Still, Amazon has never said how many Prime members it has, leaving Wall Street analysts to make educated guesses about just how many people are paying the annual fee for the service, which is crucial to Amazon’s strategy for increasing retail sales, building a video service to compete with Netflix and other ambitions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Of course, “tens of millions of members” leaves a lot to the imagination. Still, that choice of words clearly implies that Prime membership is north of 20 million accounts, higher than the 16 million to 18 million some analysts had estimated. Amazon also said it added more than a million new Prime customers during the third week of December.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s new spirit of transparency did not, however, extend to its Kindle family of devices, the total sales of which are still shrouded in mystery. How many of the devices did Amazon sell this year? The company said only that “millions of customers unwrapped Kindle e-readers and Kindle Fire tablets this holiday season.”</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/amazon-floats-the-notion-of-delivery-drones/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Floats the Notion of Delivery </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/amazon-floats-the-notion-of-delivery-drones/" target="_blank">Drones</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/amazon-tightens-shipping-requirements/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Raises Threshold for Free </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/amazon-tightens-shipping-requirements/" target="_blank">Shipping</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/the-price-of-amazon/" class="a" target="_blank">The Price of </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/the-price-of-amazon/" target="_blank">Amazon</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/26/amazon-starts-a-shopping-site-for-the-environmental-crowd/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Starts a Shopping Site for the Environmental </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/26/amazon-starts-a-shopping-site-for-the-environmental-crowd/" target="_blank">Crowd</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/questions-for-amazon-on-privacy-and-the-kindle-fire/" class="a" target="_blank">Questions for Amazon on Privacy and the Kindle </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/questions-for-amazon-on-privacy-and-the-kindle-fire/" target="_blank">Fire</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon said that there are “tens of millions of members” of its Prime service, which provides people with free two-day shipping and a list of other benefits. | Ross D.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A blue BMW crossed the cracked parking lot and rolled to a stop outside a tired-looking Macy’s.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The passenger door opened, and out sprang John Donahoe, the chief executive of eBay, who began striding toward the store. It was earlier this year, and from the outside the Westfield Valley Fair mall near San Jose had a kind of ghost-town feel to it. But Donahoe thinks he can change that. As he walked from store to store — a nearly empty GNC, a quiet Foot Locker — he pointed out how little had changed in physical retail stores over the last 30 or 40 years and what would have to change in the next few years in order for these stores to compete with Amazon and Walmart.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As he sat in a patisserie on the mall’s ground floor, Donahoe touched on his usual themes: how technology has driven scale and automation; how the big-box retailers have crushed Main Street; the way in which our shopping experiences have become less dependent on human interaction. And these changes in the commercial landscape, he said, tend to be ‘‘phrased in zero-sum terms: big retailers versus the little guy. Local versus global. The Chinese imports will kill you. Online is going to disrupt offline.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There has been much talk about Amazon driving retailers out of business — most recently, and somewhat unbelievably, by proposing to use drones to deliver purchases. For some time now, physical retailers have lived in fear of the various ways in which Amazon can undercut them. If you’re looking for a product that you don’t need to try on or try out, Amazon’s customer analytics and nationwide network of 40-plus enormous fulfillment centers is awfully tough to compete with. And even if you do need to try something on, Amazon conveniently includes a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bar-code scanner in its mobile application so you can compare prices while you’re in a store and then have the same item shipped to your home with just a few clicks. (Retailers call this act of checking out products in a store and then buying them online from a different vendor ‘‘showrooming.’’) Amazon holds such sway that for many it’s the default place to buy things online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And yet online commerce currently accounts for only about 6 percent of all commerce in the United States. We still buy more than 90 percent of everything we purchase offline, often by handing over money or swiping a credit card in exchange for the goods we want. But the proliferation of smartphones and tablets has increasingly led to the use of digital technology to help us make those purchases, and it’s in that convergence that eBay sees its opportunity. As Donahoe puts it: ‘‘We view it actually as and. Not online, not offline: Both.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most people think of eBay as an online auction house, the world’s biggest garage sale, which it has been for most of its life. But since Donahoe took over in 2008, he has slowly moved the company beyond auctions, developing technology partnerships with big retailers like Home Depot, Macy’s, Toys ‘‘R’’ Us and Target and expanding eBay’s online marketplace to include reliable, returnable goods at fixed prices. (Auctions currently represent just 30 percent of the purchases made at eBay.com; the site sells 13,000 cars a week through its mobile app alone, many at fixed prices.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under Donahoe, eBay has made 34 acquisitions over the last five years, most of them to provide the company and its retail partners with enhanced technology. EBay can help with the back end of websites, create interactive storefronts in real-world locations, streamline the electronic-payment process or help monitor inventory in real time. (Outsourcing some of the digital strategy and technological operations to eBay frees up companies to focus on what they presumably do best: Make and market their own products.) In select cities, eBay has also recently introduced eBay Now, an app that allows you to order goods from participating local vendors and have them delivered to your door in about an hour for a $5 fee. The company is betting its future on the idea that its interactive technology can turn shopping into a kind of entertainment, or at least make commerce something more than simply working through price-plus-shipping calculations. If eBay can get enough people into Dick’s Sporting</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Goods to try out a new set of golf clubs and then get them to buy those clubs in the store, instead of from Amazon, there’s a business model there.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A key element of eBay’s vision of the future is the digital wallet. On a basic level, having a ‘‘digital wallet’’ means paying with your phone, but it’s about a lot more than that; it’s as much a concept as a product. EBay bought PayPal in 2002, after PayPal established itself as a safe way to transfer money between people who didn’t know each other (thus facilitating eBay purchases). For the last several years, eBay has regarded digital payments through mobile devices as having the potential to change everything — to become, as David Marcus, PayPal’s president, puts it, ‘‘Money 3.0.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EBay’s current iteration of Money 3.0 sits on the third floor of a low-rise building on Sixth Avenue in the Flatiron district of Manhattan, in a series of spaces that the company calls the Commerce Innovation Showcase. A ‘‘brand ambassador’’ named Josh Beyers led me on a tour through them earlier this year. As he moved from a model living room to a model toy store to a model cafe, the PayPal mobile app served as a kind of virtual key that unlocked everything that you might want to do in places like these. Once Beyers ‘‘checked in’’ through the app at the toy store, for example, he was able to retrieve a purchase that he made earlier on the eBay website without ever having to remove his phone from his pocket. At the cafe, Beyers’s sandwich — which he ordered earlier from his phone, down to the condiments — was ready for him when he arrived. The app also saved his preferences, so he could order the same thing again later without having to repeat the process. His picture popped up on the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">point-of-sale system at the cafe, and the ‘‘clerk’’ verified who he was and then handed him his sandwich. At a model stadium, he entered with a digital ticket — StubHub, the online-ticket-resale vendor, was acquired by eBay several years ago — and was able to have food delivered to his seat and a souvenir jersey sent to his home that same day, even though the in-stadium store was sold out.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There was a hokey Potemkin village feel to the whole show, but the seamlessness of the personalization was striking. When you shop online — when you do anything online, as we are all supposed to know by now — you’re being tracked. Sites know who you are, when you’re there, how you got there, what pages you clicked on, how long you stayed on each page and in some instances exactly where and for how long your cursor hovered as you tried to make up your mind. Online companies collect all of this information and use it. Offline retailers — physical stores — do not have these advantages. They don’t know who you are unless you use your card to buy something, and that’s only after the fact. They can’t target you or make you any kind of specific offer, as online retailers can. The technology on display in eBay’s Commerce Innovation Showcase is designed to try to close that gap.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EBay can’t claim to be the only one capable of bringing this vision to life. Along with others, Walmart is also making the move into digital retailing as fast as it can in an effort to compete with Amazon — and in a much more direct way. Walmart’s reputation in Silicon Valley is for a kind of old-school efficiency: getting pallets of goods (often from China) into a big-box store in America and then into the hands of its customers, all for very low prices. There are more than 200 million visits to its stores every week. But until fairly recently, Walmart’s online search engine was having trouble doing something as simple as identifying what visitors wanted when they searched for ‘‘denim.’’ And so two years ago the company opened @WalmartLabs, in Silicon Valley, where 1,500 people now work. There are an additional 1,000 people around the world dedicated solely to e-commerce. All of Walmart’s stores are now ‘‘geofenced’’ — that is, they know when individual customers are in the store, thanks to the Walmart app on their phones that can guide them to what they want. In roughly 220 of Walmart’s 4,000 locations, customers can make their purchases with their telephones, bypassing registers (and their lines) altogether. ‘‘People know Walmart as the world’s largest retailer, but they’re going to know us as one of the largest and fastest-growing e-commerce companies,’’ Neil Ashe, the head of global e-commerce at Walmart, said. This is corporate messaging, to be sure, but it also reflects a very real shift in strategy. Ashe has said elsewhere that turning Walmart into a digital retailer is not just a project but a permanent part of its future as a business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“People expect Toys ‘R’ Us to act like Amazon,’’ said Christopher Saridakis, who heads eBay Enterprise, ‘‘but they don’t realize how hard it is.’’ He was preparing to show me around a 543,000-square-foot fulfillment center in a remote corporate complex in Walton, Ky. What he meant was that Amazon has conditioned consumers to expect an ease to online shopping — a few clicks, desired items always in stock, free two-day shipping and returns — that physical retailers have a hard time competing with. EBay Enterprise, which was known as GSI Commerce when eBay purchased it in 2011, now drives eBay’s effort to enable its larger retail partners to meet the same expectations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Saridakis referred to the facility in Walton as ‘‘the other side of the computer’’: When we press ‘‘buy’’ on the websites of Levi’s or Aéropostale or Quicksilver or PBS or Major League Baseball, whose products are all warehoused in Walton, that purchase often becomes a package bound from Walton for your door. Five miles of conveyor belts feed into a double-tilt tray sorter that dumps individually wrapped goods into the appropriate</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">chutes at one end of the facility and then packed-and-stamped boxes onto ramps that lead directly into UPS trucks at the other. Almost 200,000 products from nearly 600,000 unique locations within the facility make their way via human pickers and machine sorters into the proper packages and off to the people who want them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EBay Enterprise also helps retailers rethink and reorganize how they use their physical stores. Increasingly, retailers are starting to regard their stores as small-scale distribution centers for their products, as nodes in the fulfillment process as well as showrooms. If you live in Manhattan and you order Beanie Babies online from Toys ‘‘R’’ Us, sometimes it makes more economic sense for an employee at a local Toys ‘‘R’’ Us to pack and ship that order than it does to have the fulfillment center in Kentucky do it. This takes an enormous amount of integrated technology to orchestrate, but it’s also the only way to compete with Amazon: using everything from physical stores to mobile applications to delivery services to make sure that customers can get what they want when they want it. Walmart is doing some of the same things: building million-square-foot online-only warehouses and experimenting with using stores as distribution centers. The company is now shipping goods directly from roughly 35 of its 4,000 stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While this process is about efficiently moving goods, the deeper purpose is to improve and manage the relationship with the customer. Healey Cypher, the head of retail innovation at eBay, tells a story about a bookseller who was convinced that online commerce would kill his business: ‘‘I said to him: ‘How do you know when someone’s in your store? You don’t, unless they bought something, and then only after the purchase. What if you had a platform for the first time ever that said, ‘‘This person is in your store, they like these things, they bought these things on your web store, and here’s an offer you should give them based on their purchases’’? You don’t have to take it, but you’ve never had that opportunity before.’ ’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The best current example of the digital wallet’s promise, according to many in Silicon Valley, is Uber, a digital platform that connects riders and drivers. You enter your credit-card information into the Uber app once, and then every time you want to use it, the app knows where you are and shows you how many cars are nearby and how soon one can be available. You order with one touch on a mobile screen, and a text lets you know a driver is on the way and then another tells you when he’s near. He greets you by name, you tell him where you want to go and then, when you are dropped off, there is no further exchange — no tip, no receipt, no signing anything. The app takes care of all that for you. Uber didn’t change anything about the nature of cars or how they are driven. It just figured out how to use data and technology to make what was out there work much more efficiently. (EBay, through its acquisition of the company Shutl, has begun to exploit a similar inefficiency in the spare capacity of courier companies.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this fashion, services can become both frictionless and more personal to you. Imagine that everything functioned as Uber does. Steve Yankovich, the vice president of innovation and new ventures at eBay, often asks people to do just that in order to envision eBay’s plans for the future. Imagine that, when you walk into a store,  you could look at your mobile device and see everything currently available in your size there. Instead of having to stuff the ‘‘buy nine sandwiches, get the 10th sandwich free’’ cards from various merchants into your wallet, suppose every 10th sandwich showed up free without your having to do anything at all. Ditto your frequent-flier information and every other affinity or rewards program.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It’s not about payment,’’ Jack Dorsey, a founder of Square, a PayPal competitor, says. ‘‘It’s about identity. And it’s about the experience that a merchant can create, which is what actually builds loyalty. We believe that it’s important that the technology, the mechanics of payments, actually fade away to the background. They disappear completely.’’ After helping found Twitter in 2006, Dorsey became chief executive of Square in 2009. Its initial innovation was the Square Reader, a small device that plugs into the headphone jack of a smartphone or tablet and enables anyone, anywhere, to process a credit-card payment. (PayPal now has a similar reader.) In 2011, Square introduced what would become known as the Square Wallet, an app that links to a credit card (as Uber does) and allows consumers to pay either by holding their phones up to a scanner or, in some cases, simply by having the phones on in their pockets. Dorsey talks about how cool it is to get your coffee without having to do anything, but he also emphasizes what it means for the merchants. ‘‘The seller gets this very interesting tool,’’ he says. ‘‘They can recognize me when I walk in.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The idea is that, someday not too far off from now, you’ll store everything in your digital wallet that you currently store in your old leather one — including your driver’s license, health-insurance information, all of it. We’ve all gone out for the night and not wanted to bring a bulky wallet, so we grab our phone, our license, a credit card and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$20 and head out the door. The digital wallet, if it develops to its potential, will make the license and the credit card redundant, and eventually also the $20.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s hard to predict who will prevail in any sector of the tech world, but PayPal does have some advantages. This year Square processed more than $20 billion in payments — mostly through its card readers, not the wallet — but</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PayPal has 137 million active users, and millions of them have downloaded the PayPal app. PayPal’s head start has enabled it to create a greater variety of payment options than other companies offer. It doesn’t just link to a credit card. It’s set up more like a bank: through it, you can make payments with any of your credit cards or a debit card, have the amount withdrawn directly from your checking account or even finance the purchase through a line of credit with PayPal itself. And for up to a week after you’ve made a purchase, you can choose how you want to pay for it. Almost anybody can build a digital wallet. The trick is getting people to entrust that wallet with their financial information and then to offer them enough benefits that they’ll use it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Of course there’s a catch — or, really, a series of catches. The first is that there’s not much genuine demand for the digital wallet. Even Hill Ferguson, PayPal’s chief product officer, says, ‘‘The digital wallet is the linchpin for everything we do, but it’s interesting, because consumers aren’t asking for them.’’ People who don’t work at corporations that have a financial interest in digital wallets are even more direct. Sucharita Mulpuru, a vice president with Forrester Research who specializes in online commerce and consumer behavior, says: ‘‘Digital wallets, at this point in time, are solutions looking for problems. We don’t fundamentally have friction in payments in the U.S. People who want to use cash are using cash for a reason: They prefer to or they don’t want to be traced. As for credit cards, there is not something fundamentally inconvenient about them. They’re fast, they’re reliable, our networks are good.’’ She has also been watching a start-up called Coin, which is basically one card with a magnetic strip that can store any swipable card that you have. At the point of sale you can pick one by pressing a button on the card. This requires no change whatsoever in consumer behavior. (PayPal has issued a card, together with Discover, for much the same reason: some people aren’t quite ready to make the leap to purely digital transactions.) Credit cards really are pretty easy. And if you’re paying with your phone, what do you do if you run out of batteries or if the network is down? The credit-card network rarely falters, and it is ubiquitous; as of now, there are very few places that look anything like the Commerce Innovation Showcase.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another catch is that the ‘‘personalization’’ envisioned by the pioneers of the digital wallet isn’t really all that personal, and in many ways the process benefits retailers more than it does consumers. Entering a store that happens to be geofenced and receiving notifications on your phone based on who you are and where you’re standing — does anybody truly want that? The same can be asked of mobile coupons meant to pull people into stores. The lack of demand for this stuff right now suggests that consumers aren’t so sure. Having a clerk you don’t know identify you by your picture on a point-of-sale system and then hand you your macchiato isn’t much of a personal interaction. Yes, you might be addressed by name, but it doesn’t mean you’re going to get to know the clerk. People at PayPal and Square rhapsodize about the bygone era of 50 or 100 years ago when you went to a general store in which the owner knew your name and you had an account and simply took what you wanted and then settled up at some later date. But it’s a purposefully naïve reading of an idealized past that most of us never experienced. ‘‘We use newly coined ideas of authenticity to attempt to hold on to something we can’t quite articulate that might have been lost in the course of becoming modern,’’ Jaron Lanier, a well-known computer scientist and technology expert, writes in his recent book, ‘‘Who Owns the Future?’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are also privacy concerns. Consumers have to be willing to share information about themselves — their location, their preferences — in order for the software to do its job. With the recent revelations that the government has been watching us more thoroughly than we ever knew, that has become a tougher sell than it once was. Security and the risk of identity theft pose challenges, too. The hope, according to David Marcus of PayPal, is that biometric technologies — for example, the fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5s — will eventually become ubiquitous and create the sense of security that people need to make the leap to mobile-only transactions. In general, Silicon Valley tends to be overly optimistic about how fast new technologies and behaviors will be adopted. Payment companies talk about making the transition to digital payments within the next three to five years, but Mulpuru says she thinks it’s going to be at least 10 years before people are ready to accept such a radically new way of doing things.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In some ways, the future is already here. At City Winery in New York City right now, you can use your PayPal app to track your bill in real time as you eat and drink and then pay it (including the gratuity) on your phone without having to wait for the server. (Ferguson, who’s in charge of PayPal’s digital wallet, says that the early results indicate that diners leave bigger tips when they don’t have to wait for the check.) And maybe it is better if our phones can work quietly from our pockets instead of drawing our attention away from others. ‘‘I think technology is at its best when it reminds us that we already have everything we need,’’ Jack Dorsey says. ‘‘I’m excited when technology disappears more and we’re using what we already have. This whole trend of moving from a keyboard and a mouse to actually using our fingers, our voice.’’ We carry our phones with us everywhere today, but that doesn’t mean we will in a few years. The strategy of the future isn’t necessarily about your phone. It’s about your phone as another intelligent screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EBay and Square and retailers trying to compete with Amazon have to try to take advantage of every new technology because that seems to be the best way to avoid being squashed. Amazon is so big, has so many</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">distribution centers and offers so much ease of use that in some sense it has already won — unless its competitors can find new ways to bring the convenience and connectivity of online interaction to the physical retail world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But even John Donahoe hesitates to predict exactly what facets of the digital wallet, or of the technologies that eBay is trying to deliver to its retail partners, will take off. Maybe a ‘‘smart’’ mirror in a store, which takes your measurements and allows you to try on several outfits virtually and then purchase them from the screen itself, will catch on; maybe it won’t. (EBay has been experimenting with a concept it calls Connected Glass, and the company says it’s much less gimmicky than it sounds. Right now eBay uses it mostly to create interactive digital storefronts in physical locations like a mall or an unused building, but Yankovich says that someday we’ll pull up to a drive-through and order by touching the connected screen embedded in our driver-side windows.) Maybe eBay will find itself fabricating things via 3-D printing, instead of simply facilitating sales. Maybe you’ll be able to use your camera to take a panoramic scan of your surroundings and then tap on any item in the image and look up all kinds of things about it, from its cost to its user manual.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In five years, digital wallets may well be a part of how we live, but they might also remain the province of the same early adopters who bought Segways. The recent rise of Bitcoin proves how fast things can change.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nobody’s going to use a PayPal digital wallet just because John Donahoe wants them to. Many people at eBay said the exact same thing, as if singing from the same sheet: ‘‘The consumer leads; the technology enables.’’ A good tagline, but it’s also true. If you don’t like it, if it doesn’t give you something you don’t want to live without, you won’t use it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I would say everything we’re doing is just enabling the future,’’ Donahoe said, as we wrapped up our interview at the Westfield mall. The slow trickle of midday mall traffic eased past us. He sounded confident, even if the future was a little hard to see from where we were sitting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Himmelman is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of “Yours in Truth: A Personal Portrait of Ben Bradlee.” Editor: Dean Robinson</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Photo illustration by Grant Cornett Document NYTFEED020131219e9cm001jl</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_036.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark66">Q&amp;A</a><a name="bookmark67">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Personal Tech; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Saving Kindle Notes Online, and Cleaning an LCD Screen</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By J.

I know how to make notes and highlights in the text of a Kindle e-book, but how do you get all the annotations out of the book file for use elsewhere?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Amazon&#39;s website stores copies of all the notes and highlights you make in the e-books on your Kindle. To see a list of marked passages and virtual margin notes for each book, log in at kindle.amazon.com with your Amazon username and password, then click on &#39;&#39;Your Highlights&#39;&#39; at the top of the page.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the Your Highlights page, you can see a list of all your Kindle books -- with all the highlighted passages and personal notes in each one displayed.

What&#39;s the best way to clean a flat-panel HDTV LCD screen?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A. Check the manual or online support site for your television to get specific instructions, but definitely do not use Windex or other household cleaning solutions. Many cleaning products contain ammonia, alcohol or other chemicals that could damage the coating on the flat-panel screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even paper towels may cause scratches, so many manufacturers recommend using a soft, lint-free microfiber cleaning cloth to gently wipe down the screen. Some new televisions even include a cleaning cloth in the box, but if you have misplaced it, you can find microfiber wipes at electronics and camera stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some manufacturers advise slightly dampening the cleaning cloth with water -- or a highly diluted solution of water and mild dish soap for really dirty screens. Commercial kits that include the microfiber cloth and a cleaning solution meant for LCD screens are another option. In many cases, however, these can cost $10 to $20 to do the same job as a $2 microfiber cloth and a dash of water.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TIP OF THE WEEK Thanks to the notifications feature built into iOS, iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches can keep you up to date with alerts from your favorite apps and news sites. If you would like a little peace and quiet from audible notifications during the overnight hours or even during meetings (or naps), you can temporarily silence them all with the Do Not Disturb feature built into iOS 6 and later.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To set up Do Not Disturb in iOS 7, tap the Settings icon on the Home screen and then tap Do Not Disturb. In iOS 6, tap the Settings icon, then Notifications and then Do Not Disturb. Here, you can schedule regular hours without alerts (like 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. for a good night&#39;s sleep) while allowing FaceTime calls and messages from specific contacts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In iOS 7, Do Not Disturb can also be turned on and off manually by swiping up from the bottom of the screen to call up the Control Center and tapping the moon icon.

Until now, Cloudera had sold its software into private systems, either on its own or through resellers.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/technology/google-joins-a-heavyweight-competition-in-cloud-computing.html" class="s1" target="_blank">The move is another </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/technology/google-joins-a-heavyweight-competition-in-cloud-computing.html" class="a" target="_blank">acknowledgment of the growing power</a> <span style=" color: #000;">of public clouds, which are ways that companies and individuals can rent vast amounts of computing power, data storage and software over the Internet. In addition, it’s an admission by Cloudera that the company needs to take its products to a place where they could conceivably help a competitor.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloudera makes for big data analysis based on an open source project called Hadoop. Cloudera contributes to Hadoop but charges for the products it builds for itself. Amazon Web Services has released some of its own big data products this year, making it something of a Cloudera competitor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“People need to deploy their big data analysis systems where they have their data,” said Mike Olson, Cloudera’s chief strategy officer. “Increasingly, that is the public cloud.” He added: “We could go to others, like Microsoft or Google, but if you want market share, you’re going to Amazon.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloudera charges customers based on the number of servers using its software, a pricing model that should work tolerably well on Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S. Mr. Olson is hoping that the ease with which people can rent more servers on A.W.S. means he’ll make even more, at least at first. “More engines on the same data load is going to win,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He praised A.W.S. for the way it had “democratized” some of the more expensive parts of big data analysis, but also said that A.W.S. can add features and services that will enter Cloudera’s turf.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Do we end up overlapping? That may happen,” he said. “But it would be crazy not to be a part of this – those guys are a force of nature. We want to work with the best companies that have the best infrastructure.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a statement accompanying a Cloudera news release about the collaboration between the two companies, Terry Wise, a director of partnerships at Amazon Web Services, said the deal offered customers more choice of products. “Customers will have access to a leading Hadoop implementation,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon declined to provide any further comment on the move. That kind of restraint all but signals a battle for features, functionality and lower prices somewhere down the line.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/amazon-bares-its-computers/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Bares Its </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/amazon-bares-its-computers/" target="_blank">Computers</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/amazon-web-services-gets-personal-and-pretty/" class="a" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services Gets Personal and </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/amazon-web-services-gets-personal-and-pretty/" target="_blank">Pretty</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/g-e-s-industrial-internet-goes-big/" class="a" target="_blank">G.E.’s ‘Industrial Internet’ Goes </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/g-e-s-industrial-internet-goes-big/" target="_blank">Big</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/the-cloud-era-begins-for-enterprise-tech/" class="a" target="_blank">The Cloud Era Begins for Enterprise </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/the-cloud-era-begins-for-enterprise-tech/" target="_blank">Tech</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/big-data-in-more-hands/" class="a" target="_blank">Big Data in More </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/big-data-in-more-hands/" target="_blank">Hands</a></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mike Olson, chief strategy officer of Cloudera, which offers a popular version of the open source database called Hadoop. | Mike Olson, chief strategy officer of Cloudera, which offers a popular version of the open source database called Hadoop.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTB000020131219e9cj0030d</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_038.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark70">finance</a><a name="bookmark71">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon faces protest by Germans on home turf; Workers try to enlist aid of U.S. unions with rally at retailer’s headquarters</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">679 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">17 December 2013 International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon employees in Germany have been battling the retailer with a series of wildcat strikes, most recently at the end of November. These protests, involving hundreds of Amazon workers at two fulfillment centers, have been the first strikes against the e-commerce leader anywhere in the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Monday the strikers are hoping to increase the pressure by taking the battle to the retailer’s Seattle headquarters. A rally was scheduled for midmorning, with the organizers hoping to draw in local union workers as well as sympathetic members of the public.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Technology companies, including Amazon, are getting ever richer and more powerful, but there seems to be a bit of a backlash developing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In San Francisco last week, protesters briefly blocked a Google bus transporting workers to its Silicon Valley campus. Amazon’s announcement two weeks ago on the American news program ‘‘60 Minutes’’ that it was pursuing delivery by drones inspired not admiration but widespread mockery. Amazon, critics said, was dwelling in fantasyland.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps Amazon started talking about drones as a form of wish fulfillment. For the retailer, the moment when machines prepare and deliver packages could not come too soon. Germany is Amazon’s second-largest market, and the labor turmoil there shows no sign of resolution.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the surface, the dispute is about money. The German labor union ver.di wants Amazon workers classified as retailing employees, but Amazon says they are logistics workers who should be paid less.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon workers in Germany also staged a strike Monday. The company, which employs 9,000 warehouse staff in Germany plus 14,000 seasonal workers at nine distribution centers, said only 640 workers had failed to turn up for the early shift, The Associated Press reported.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ver.di said up to 700 workers joined the strike in Amazon’s logistic center in Bad Hersfeld, as did more than 200 in Leipzig, according to The A.P. Workers at Amazon’s center in Werne were set to strike on Tuesday, ver.di said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Underlying the discontent is a bigger question of whether the warehouse workers should have any control over their workplace. The employees, also known as pickers, assemble the orders. Amazon warehouses are marvels of engineering and efficiency, but picking is still hard physical labor. There is constant monitoring and little job security.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon, in its race to stay the dominant e-commerce company, wants maximum flexibility to use its workers as it will. Negotiating would impede efficiency and innovation, Dave Clark, the company’s vice president for worldwide operations and customer service, told The Times last summer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pickers see it differently. ‘‘The workers are treated more as robots than human,’’ Markus Hoffmann-Achenbach, an organizer for ver.di at the Amazon warehouse in the city of Werne, said by email. He was on his way to Seattle to participate in the demonstration.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘As a worldwide company,’’ Mr. Hoffmann-Achenbach added, ‘‘Amazon should treat their workers fairly and with respect in every country. The solidarity of American unions and ver.di, the united services union of Germany, is a</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sign that social movements are not bounded by national borders and that in times of globalization the workers worldwide stand together as one.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Also traveling to Seattle was Nancy Becker, an American who has been an employee of Amazon in Germany since 2001. ‘‘I’m coming to Seattle to dare Jeff Bezos to try working as a picker for a single week,’’ she said. ‘‘I’m sure he would not survive.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment, but Ralf Kleber, the top Amazon executive in Germany, dismissed the strikers in a recent interview with Reuters, saying the walkout did not slow down deliveries. He also said the workers were largely unskilled and had been unemployed for a long time, with the implication that they should be grateful to be working for Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">The union is promising another strike before the holidays.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Three months ago, you could buy a share of Amazon for $300. Today, it would cost you nearly $400. Surely such a run-up was driven by expectations that the company&#39;s all-important fourth quarter would be even better than forecast.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Except analysts have been cutting their profit estimates, not raising them. Three months ago, according to Yahoo Finance, analysts calculated that the retailer would earn 77 cents this quarter. Now they foresee only 66 cents.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is the kind of thing that drives Amazon detractors crazy. Lowered expectations mean Amazon has a greater chance of meeting or exceeding them, which would in turn be interpreted as bullish by investors, driving the stock up again.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Paulo Santos, a Portuguese trader who writes for Seeking Alpha, has been one of the most consistent and impassioned Amazon critics during the last few years. He has argued that the company is losing money not because it is investing for the future, which is what Amazon says, but because it is a less-than-great business. He has put his money where his arguments are, betting the stock will go down.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In retrospect, that was not a good idea.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I lost and lost big,&#39;&#39; Mr. Santos told me in an email.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Amazon is more unprofitable now than when I started writing about it, will remain more unprofitable than when I started writing about it, but the stock went up a lot in spite of that.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Santos declined to be more specific about his losses, but he said the final straw came when the company released its third-quarter results seven weeks ago. Amazon&#39;s revenue was about $400 million more than anticipated, and the stock rose nearly 10 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The unexpected increase in revenue, Mr. Santos argued, could be attributed to a change in accounting in which e-books are accounted for at 100 percent of revenue instead of 30 percent of revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Others wondered this as well. During the Oct. 24 earnings call, Tom Szkutak, Amazon&#39;s chief financial officer, was asked whether an accounting change was driving revenue growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;It&#39;s not a significant or meaningful impact to the overall growth rates, and certainly this transition has been going on for, you know, some number of quarters now, so it&#39;s not a lot I can help you with there,&#39;&#39; Mr. Szkutak said, according to the transcript.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a typical Amazon response. The company was eager to talk about delivering packages by drones, something that will not happen for years if it ever does. But in general, it says as little as it can about how it makes</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- or does not make -- money.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most investors and analysts believe there are good things happening that they cannot quite see. Only a very few, including Mr. Santos, argue that it is the opposite.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet even the analysts, who are paid big money to understand the company, often appear to be guessing.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A columnist for Barron&#39;s recently asked a half-dozen Amazon analysts for their Kindle Fire sales estimates. Their answers for 2012 ranged from seven million units to 12.6 million. For 2013, the range was even wider: 10 million to 22.6 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon says it sells the tablets at cost; it will make its money when people stock up the devices with entertainment. But it does not break out sales of digital media, either.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;They are remarkably adept at putting out a good press release that shows their forward momentum without actually showing their cards,&#39;&#39; Tom Mainelli, who covers tablets for IDC, told the newspaper.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Santos is still convinced he is right about Amazon, but he has thrown in the towel. &#39;&#39;I concede defeat,&#39;&#39; he told his readers. He described himself to me as &#39;&#39;frustrated and furious.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment about Mr. Santos, who might be defeated but cannot stay away from the subject. A recent post laid out the reasons Amazon is losing ground to both Google and Walmart.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Of the 25 analysts covering the electronics retailer </a><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/best_buy_company/index.html?inline=nyt-org" class="a" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> <span style=" color: #000;">, he was the only one to make a buy recommendation. And the stock kept going down.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Everyone thought Amazon was going to put them out of business,” Mr. Strasser told me this week. “I’d go into a meeting with clients and the minute I said the words ‘Best Buy,’ they’d look at their watch and say, ‘Gotta go.’ ”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No wonder: Many retail chains were reeling from Internet competition. Best Buy’s former rival Circuit City had already gone bankrupt. Best Buy’s stock had dropped to $11.29 last Dec. 28, from over $50 in 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Strasser clung stubbornly to his conviction that Best Buy would be an exception. Analysts at Janney aren’t allowed to invest in the companies they cover, but “if I could have dropped the coverage and bought the stock, I would have,” Mr. Strasser said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But not even Mr. Strasser believed Best Buy could pull off one of the biggest turnarounds in retail history, which may be what it’s doing if the stock price is any measure.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Best Buy stock has gained nearly 240 percent so far this year, putting it among the top three performing stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index. Now every struggling chain, from J. C.

A French-born graduate of the prestigious École des Hautes Études Commerciales and the Institut d’Etudes Politiques, both in Paris, Mr. Joly was chief executive of Carlson, which owns the travel service Carlson Wagonlit, the Radisson Hotel chain and T.G.I. Fridays restaurants.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because Carlson, based in Minneapolis, is privately held, Mr. Joly wasn’t known in the investment community. And given the length of the search that resulted in his selection at Best Buy — nine months — many investors assumed that numerous others had rejected the job.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Everyone assumed they had to scrape the bottom of the barrel,” Mr. Strasser said. “But my brother’s in the hotel business and he knew this guy. He said, ‘He’s the smartest guy in the room, even if he does speak with a French accent.’ ”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Best Buy at the time was in turmoil, its staff demoralized from declining same-store sales, its stock price falling, the previous chief executive ousted in a sex scandal and a leveraged buyout attempt underway by Best Buy’s founder, Richard M. Schulze. That effort later collapsed.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/897815-best-buys-plan-to-turn-itself-around.html%23document/p23/a137201" class="s1" target="_blank">In his first major presentation to analysts, Mr. Joly coolly analyzed Best Buy’s strengths and weaknesses — which </a><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/897815-best-buys-plan-to-turn-itself-around.html%23document/p23/a137201" class="a" target="_blank">included the perception</a> <span style=" color: #000;">that Best Buy was not the low-price leader. In one survey, only 23 percent of respondents thought Best Buy’s prices were “lower than others,” far behind Walmart (71 percent), Amazon (56 percent) and Target (38 percent). The result was that many shoppers were browsing in a Best Buy store, using their phones to compare prices and then ordering online from a Best Buy competitor.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like many ideas that seem brilliant in hindsight, “the strategy is very simple,” Mr. Joly said in 2012, soon after he took the job. “We believe that price-competitiveness is table stakes. The way we want to win is around the advice, convenience, service.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By matching the lowest price and enhancing service, he was determined to make sure that a customer who came to Best Buy as a showroom had no reason to buy anywhere else.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Strasser attended a conference where Mr. Joly spoke. “It jumped out at me,” Mr. Strasser said, “that the most important thing they said was, ‘If we get someone in the store and they don’t buy, then shame on us. If we get them in the store, they’re going to buy.’ ”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A few other analysts also took note.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Embracing the showroom — that was brilliant,” said Anthony Chukumba, an analyst at BB&amp;T Capital Markets, and the first analyst to upgrade Best Buy to buy, which he did in January of this year. “Customer traffic was never the problem. It was conversion. Best Buy said it would match any price. The knee-jerk reaction was that that would kill the margins. But Best Buy took out a lot of costs, and it can make back the margins on volume.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the strategy wasn’t premised just on price-competitiveness.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Our goal is not to be lower than the competition,” Mr. Joly said. It’s to offer “a very compelling set of customer promises with the assortment, the advice, the convenience, the service. So our goal is simply to eliminate price as an obstacle to buying.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As it happens, I’ve been in the market for a new television since the debut of “House of Cards,” the original Netflix series that I couldn’t get on my still-functioning television with its giant tube in the back. Call me hopelessly dated, but sometimes it pays to wait.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After doing some research online, I settled on what the reviews called a “low-end” Panasonic Viera model (the 50-inch X60 series plasma), which seemed perfect for my modest needs. These TVs once sold for thousands of dollars, but (even before I had the idea for this column) I found it on the Best Buy website for $399.99, with free delivery. This week, it had jumped to $499.99.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon had it for $610. Walmart didn’t have it. Sears offered it for $499.99, but wouldn’t deliver to my Manhattan neighborhood. On Google shopping, the lowest price was $399 with free shipping at ElectronicMegaSale.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(A Best Buy spokeswoman said the store would match any price if a customer showed it to an employee and the price was from a lengthy list of designated sellers. But ElectronicMegaSale.com doesn’t qualify. She said Best Buy would also match its own lower price within 15 days of purchase or, in the case of the holiday season, through Dec. 24.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I scheduled delivery online, and the night before, Best Buy called with a two-hour window. (Don’t waste your time calling them, because when I tried, the waiting time to speak to someone was “over 20 minutes.”) The TV arrived just a half-hour into the designated period, which is virtually unheard-of in my experience in New York City. And the deliveryman took away the huge old TV, all at no charge.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When it came time to set it up, I realized I needed a Blu-ray Disc player for DVDs and streaming from the Internet. So I walked a few blocks to the Best Buy store, which was recently renovated to feature Best Buy’s new “store within a store” concept featuring showrooms by brand, including Apple and Samsung. (In this, it’s mimicking broader-line department stores.) I was in the store only a few moments when a salesman materialized offering help. He quickly steered me to a Sony Blu-ray player that was $69.99.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At that price, I didn’t bother to comparison-shop, but when I later checked online, Amazon had it for $78, as did Walmart. The lowest price on Google shopping was also $78. The salesman seemed to know what he was talking about and made no effort to move me to a more expensive model — he said I didn’t need one — or talk me into any kind of service contract. I was out of the store in about five minutes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As far as I was concerned, Best Buy seems to be delivering on its promises. And that seems to be showing up in the operating results. Best Buy announced a few weeks ago that the decline in same-store sales had been reversed in the most recent quarter, and had advanced 1.7 percent. Online sales jumped 15 percent. And earnings beat expectations.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83192&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1878110&amp;highlight" class="s1" target="_blank">“Our focus on delivering our unique customer promises is starting to pay off,” </a><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83192&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1878110&amp;highlight" class="a" target="_blank">Mr. Joly said last month</a> <span style=" color: #000;">, as are “our efforts to control cost and to bring greater efficiency to our operations by improving our profitability.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He added, “While we remain mindful of the fact that we still have a long way to go, we are pleased with the progress.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The lessons for other retailers may be fairly obvious: “Embrace your customer, don’t alienate them,” said Mr. Chukumba. “They want the lowest price? They’ll get it. Better service? Give it to them.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By contrast, he said, J. C. Penney seemed to go out of its way to reject its customers. “The sales you always counted on? They’re over. The brands you love? Gone,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No one expects Best Buy stock to gain another 250 percent next year, but both Mr. Strasser and Mr. Chukumba are still recommending it. Fourteen analysts now rate it a buy or strong buy, and no one has downgraded the stock this year. But not everyone loves the Best Buy turnaround story: Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities has had a sell recommendation all through this year’s run-up, and is now the only analyst who rates Best Buy a sell.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The negative case is simple,” he told me. “It’s Amazon. The misperception about Best Buy is that, because they’re successful at intercepting the customer in the store and getting them to buy a television — and they’re doing a great job at that — they can do that with everything. That’s not even close to being true.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He pointed to Sony lithium-ion batteries. He said they were $4.99 each at Best Buy, and $8.99 at Amazon — for 20.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“That’s 45 cents each!” he said. “Yes, Best Buy will match it, but who’s ever going to buy batteries there once you see that?”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amazon doesn’t care if people buy televisions at Best Buy, he said, dismissing my shopping experience. “That’s a low-margin product,” he said. “And Best Buy’s margins are eroding.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The verdict is still out on this year’s holiday season, which will be an important test for Mr. Joly and his strategy. Mr. Strasser isn’t breaking out the champagne just yet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It was phenomenal, and it’s been a fun ride,” he said. “But the reality of this business is, you’re always right or wrong. You get humbled every day because something goes wrong. You’re only as good as your last call.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hubert Joly, the chief executive of Best Buy, at the opening of a &quot;store within a store&quot; featuring Samsung at a Best Buy in New York. | Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Samsung</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020131213e9ce003pp</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="284" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_041.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark76">COMMON SENSE</a><a name="bookmark77">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business/Financial Desk; SECTB</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Underdog Against Amazon, Best Buy Charges Ahead</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By JAMES B.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was a lonely holiday season last year for David Strasser, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. Of the 25 analysts covering the electronics retailer Best Buy, he was the only one to make a buy recommendation. And the stock kept going down.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Everyone thought Amazon was going to put them out of business,&#39;&#39; Mr. Strasser told me this week. &#39;&#39;I&#39;d go into a meeting with clients and the minute I said the words &#39;Best Buy,&#39; they&#39;d look at their watch and say, &#39;Gotta go.&#39; &#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No wonder: Many retail chains were reeling from Internet competition. Best Buy&#39;s former rival Circuit City had already gone bankrupt. Best Buy&#39;s stock had dropped to $11.29 last Dec. 28, from over $50 in 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Strasser clung stubbornly to his conviction that Best Buy would be an exception. Analysts at Janney aren&#39;t allowed to invest in the companies they cover, but &#39;&#39;if I could have dropped the coverage and bought the stock, I would have,&#39;&#39; Mr. Strasser said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But not even Mr. Strasser believed Best Buy could pull off one of the biggest turnarounds in retail history, which may be what it&#39;s doing if the stock price is any measure.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Best Buy stock has gained nearly 240 percent so far this year, putting it among the top three performing stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500-stock index. Now every struggling chain, from J. C. Penney to Barnes &amp; Noble, is scrutinizing Best Buy to figure out how the company did it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hardly anyone on Wall Street knew Hubert Joly when he was installed as Best Buy&#39;s chief executive in August 2012.

That, at least, is one conclusion to take from a new </a><a href="http://www.sba.gov/advocacy/7540/758295" class="a" target="_blank">study</a> <a href="http://www.sba.gov/advocacy/" class="s1" target="_blank">sponsored by the Small Business Administration’s </a><u>Office of Advocacy</u><span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The study found that if the proposed federal law excludes small sellers from having to collect sales taxes online, as many favor, it will probably leave at least 40 percent of all online sales untaxed. As a result, the law would not do as much as some may hope to support traditional Main Street businesses or to increase revenues for strapped municipal governments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113%3As.00743" class="s1" target="_blank">Retailers, along with state and local government officials, have joined forces to back the </a><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113%3As.00743" class="a" target="_blank">Marketplace Fairness Act</a><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113%3As.00743" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113%3As.00743" class="a" target="_blank">of 2013</a>, which passed the Senate earlier this year. The retailers say they are eager to level the playing field with merchants who sell exclusively online and collect sales taxes only in states where they have a physical presence.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The retail coalition supporting the legislation includes local businesses and national chains, mostly those whose vast networks of outlets force them to collect sales tax for most online transactions. The local governments hope to reverse a sharp decline in sales tax collection that has followed the move of commerce to the web. The proposed law carves out an exemption for small sellers — those with revenues of less than $1 million.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://web.utk.edu/%7Edbruce/" class="s1" target="_blank">The study, conducted by a University of Tennessee professor, </a>Donald Bruce<span class="p">, found that a handful of very large online sellers make the lion’s share of all sales. In fact, the 100 biggest retailers account for about half of all online sales in the United States, and the 10 largest account for a quarter of those sales. All together, e-stores with at least $1 million in sales account for more than 57 percent of total sales.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/in-tax-fight-amazon-hands-baton-to-ebay" class="s1" target="_blank">The upshot, the study suggests, is that if an online sales tax law includes an exemption for small sellers, it does not really matter where the threshold is set. Put it at $10 million, as eBay</a>has advocated<span class="p">, and the law will begin to tax somewhere between 56 and 57 percent of online sales. Set it at $500,000, as an earlier version of the Marketplace Fairness Act did, and it appears that the share of online sales subject to the tax rises to 58 percent, at most. (The study does not explicitly say this, but the amount can be derived by using Mr. Bruce’s figures.)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For states hoping to use the law to fill growing revenue holes, this bad news is made worse by the fact that many of the larger e-tailers are already collecting sales tax in many jurisdictions. In a separate 2009 study, Mr. Bruce estimated that states lost $11.4 billion to untaxed online sales. Now, however, he finds that of the portion that states could recoup — that 57 percent, give or take, not claimed by small retailers — big companies are already collecting sales tax on nearly half of the sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nor should brick-and-mortar retailers be too sanguine about the small-seller exception. In practice, the distinction between competing with small online retailers and with Amazon, the world’s largest retail website, appears to be evaporating. That’s because third-party sales through Amazon’s Marketplace for independent sellers are a growing share of total retail sales through Amazon.com, and they will probably exceed Amazon’s own retail sales this year, said Gene Munster, an analyst who follows Amazon for Piper Jaffray &amp; Co.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/271450/monthly-unique-visitors-to-us-retail-websites/" class="s1" target="_blank">Not only do those small sellers have access to Amazon’s extraordinary online presence and reach — </a><a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/271450/monthly-unique-visitors-to-us-retail-websites/" class="a" target="_blank">162 million</a><a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/271450/monthly-unique-visitors-to-us-retail-websites/" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/271450/monthly-unique-visitors-to-us-retail-websites/" class="a" target="_blank">visitors each month</a><a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/271450/monthly-unique-visitors-to-us-retail-websites/" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a>to its American site — but increasingly, they are also relying on Amazon to warehouse and ship their inventory, said Mark Miller, an analyst for the investment firm William Blair &amp; Company. All told, Amazon.com will probably account for a third of all domestic online sales in 2013, Mr. Miller said.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-19/the-internet-sales-tax-is-back-now-without-small-business-exemptions" class="s1" target="_blank">Somewhat surprisingly, given their claims to unwavering support for small businesses, House Republican leaders </a><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-19/the-internet-sales-tax-is-back-now-without-small-business-exemptions" class="a" target="_blank">appear</a> <span style=" color: #000;">to be leaning toward legislation that would offer no small-seller exemption at all. But House Republicans are divided about collecting online sales tax — Democrats largely support it — and the bill faces an uphill road in the chamber, with or without a small-business exemption.</span></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/for-local-businesses-the-internet-threat-isnt-just-the-sales-tax/" class="a" target="_blank">For Local Businesses, the Internet Threat Isn’t Just the Sales </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/for-local-businesses-the-internet-threat-isnt-just-the-sales-tax/" target="_blank">Tax</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/finding-the-right-words-to-confront-a-showroomer/" class="a" target="_blank">Finding the Right Words to Confront a </a><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/finding-the-right-words-to-confront-a-showroomer/" target="_blank">‘Showroomer’</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/partisan-divide-in-d-c-not-over-the-s-b-a/" class="a" target="_blank">Partisan Divide in D.C.?

All Rights Reserved. Raise your hand if you get this whole Amazon drone thing.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By now the next bright idea from Jeff Bezos -- that tiny drones will one day be whizzing overhead and dropping Amazon packages at America&#39;s doorsteps -- has gone through a few turns of the spin cycle. For many, it sounds like a sci-fi fantasy wrapped in public relations hype, or a total nightmare. Maybe both.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To which I say: pizza. (Stay with me.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Most of us take it for granted that we can have a pizza delivered to our door in about 30 minutes. But that kind of routine, hyper-convenience usually ends at the edge of the pizza box. Books, clothes, groceries: It usually takes at least 24 hours, and often two to five business days, for goods like those to be delivered.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Like it or not, e-commerce is changing the way the world shops. It is also changing expectations. Two-day delivery was great then, but this is now. Mr. Bezos is not the only one who says technology will continue to reshape the old-school delivery business just as it has reshaped so much else.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why? In no small part because there is money to be made. Worldwide, e-commerce sales topped $1 trillion last year, according to the research firm eMarketer. Sales growth in the double digits will almost certainly continue through at least 2016. There is going to be a lot more stuff to deliver out there. What we buy on our smartphones in seconds we want on our doorstep in minutes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even the serious technophiles like Mr. Bezos say delivery drones and their ilk are still years away. Many ordinary people probably think the idea sounds dangerous, maybe even a little creepy, given that these drones will have cameras. So far, the Federal Aviation Administration has resisted the idea. Swarms of computer-guided octocopters? As if the F.A.A. doesn&#39;t have enough to do.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But given the explosive growth of e-commerce, some experts say the shipping business is in for big changes. United Parcel Service, which traces its history to 1907, delivers more than four billion packages and documents a year. It operates a fleet of more than 95,000 vehicles and 500 aircraft. The ubiquitous Brown is a $55</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">billion-plus-a-year business. And, like Amazon, U.P.S. is reportedly looking into drones. So is Google. More and more e-commerce companies are making a point of delivering things quickly the old-fashioned way -- with humans.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of the dreamers in the technology industry are dreaming even bigger. It won&#39;t be just drones, they insist. Robots and autonomous vehicles -- think Google&#39;s driverless car -- could also disrupt the delivery business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;As cities become more automated, you&#39;re going to start to see on-demand delivery systems that look like small delivery vehicles and can bring you whatever you want to wherever you are,&#39;&#39; said Bryant Walker Smith, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School and a member of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford. &#39;&#39;Rather than go to the store to buy some milk, a robot or drone will go to a warehouse and get it for you, then deliver it.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Smith said these delivery vehicles would come in all shapes and sizes. Some might be able to scurry down alleyways and avoid traffic. Others could be refrigerated to store food.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brad Templeton, a futurist and a member of the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the current systems for delivery -- &#39;&#39;with the exception of pizza&#39;&#39; -- were too cumbersome and expensive for today&#39;s online shoppers. Autonomous vehicles, including drones, promise a faster, cheaper option.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The cost of use will be pennies on the dollar compared to today&#39;s delivery systems,&#39;&#39; Mr. Templeton said. This, he added, could very quickly eat into the business of many delivery companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;None of the horse and carriage companies of the past ended up becoming automobile companies today,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Templeton, who is also a consultant on the Google team designing a driverless car.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The roadblocks, real and potential, are significant. Safety is one worry. Another is current technology. Drones like the ones showcased by Amazon are electric and are estimated to be able to carry only small packages weighing less than five pounds. That means they would not work for most online purchases.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hal Bennett, a drone researcher, has a possible answer for that. He wants to build drones powered by tiny jet engines rather than electric ones. He says they could carry 50- and 100-pound packages 45,000 feet up at 250 miles an hour. While his drones are still in a research phase, and very much under wraps, Mr. Bennett said the possibilities were endless.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Imagine you&#39;re climbing around in Yosemite and you decided you want a Burger King hamburger. You just order it on your GPS,&#39;&#39; Mr. Bennett said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many people probably don&#39;t want to imagine that. Drones over El Capitan? Delivering, of all things, fast food?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then again, American pizzerias really began routine deliveries only in the 1950s, reflecting the rise of another bit of technology: the automobile. Then, in the &#39;60s, a man who started out with one pizzeria in Ypsilanti, Mich., came along and made quick delivery a priority. His name was Thomas Monaghan. The company: Domino&#39;s.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:bilton@nytimes.com" class="s1" target="_blank">Email: bilton@nytimes.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In an out-of-the-way Google office, two life-size humanoid robots hang suspended in a corner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Amazon.com can imagine delivering books by drones, is it too much to think that Google might be planning to one day have one of the robots hop off an automated Google Car and race to your doorstep to deliver a package?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Google executives acknowledge that robotic vision is a ‘‘moonshot.’’ But it appears to be more realistic than Amazon’s proposed drone delivery service, which Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, revealed in a television interview the evening before one of the biggest online shopping days of the year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the past half-year, Google has quietly acquired seven technology companies in an effort to create a new generation of robots. And the engineer heading the effort is Andy Rubin, the man who built Google’s Android software into the world’s dominant force in smartphones. The company is tight-lipped about its specific plans, but the scale of the investment, which has not been previously disclosed, indicates that this is no cute science project.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At least for now, Google’s robotics effort is not something aimed at consumers. Instead, the company’s expected targets are in manufacturing — like electronics assembly, which is now largely manual — and competing with companies like Amazon in retailing, according to several people with specific knowledge of the project.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A realistic case, according to several specialists, would be automating portions of an existing supply chain that stretches from a factory floor to the companies that ship and deliver goods to a consumer’s doorstep.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The opportunity is massive,’’ said Andrew McAfee, a principal research scientist at the M.I.T. Center for Digital Business. ‘‘There are still people who walk around in factories and pick things up in distribution centers and work in the back rooms of grocery stores.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google has recently started experimenting with package delivery in urban areas with its Google Shopping service, and it could try to automate portions of that system. The shopping service, available in a few locations like San Francisco, is already making home deliveries for companies like Target, Walgreens and American Eagle Outfitters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps someday, there will be automated delivery to the doorstep, which for now is dependent on humans.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘‘Like any moonshot, you have to think of time as a factor,’’ Mr. Rubin said. ‘‘We need enough runway and a 10-year vision.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Rubin, the 50-year-old Google executive in charge of the new effort, began his engineering career in robotics and has long had a well-known passion for building intelligent machines. Before joining Apple Computer, where he initially worked as a manufacturing engineer in the 1990s, he worked for the German manufacturing company Carl Zeiss as a robotics engineer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I have a history of making my hobbies into a career,’’ Mr. Rubin said in a telephone interview. ‘‘This is the world’s greatest job. Being an engineer and a tinkerer, you start thinking about what you would want to build for yourself.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He used the example of a windshield wiper that has enough ‘‘intelligence’’ to operate when it rains, without human intervention, as a model for the kind of systems he is trying to create. That is consistent with a vision put forward by the Google co-founder Larry Page, who has argued that technology should be deployed wherever possible to free humans from drudgery and repetitive tasks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The veteran of a number of previous Silicon Valley start-up efforts and twice a chief executive, Mr. Rubin said he had pondered the possibility of a commercial effort in robotics for more than a decade. He has only recently come to think that a range of technologies have matured to the point where new kinds of automated systems can be commercialized.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Earlier this year, Mr. Rubin stepped down as head of the company’s Android smartphone division. Since then he has convinced Google’s founders, Sergey Brin and Mr. Page, that the time is right for such a venture, and they have opened Google’s checkbook to back him. He declined to say how much the company would spend.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Rubin compared the effort to the company’s self-driving car project, which was started in 2009. ‘‘The automated car project was science fiction when it started,’’ he said. ‘‘Now it is coming within reach.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He acknowledged that breakthroughs would still be necessary in areas like software and sensors, but said that hardware issues like mobility and moving hands and arms had been resolved.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Rubin has secretly acquired an array of robotics and artificial intelligence start-up companies in the United States and Japan. Among the companies are Schaft, a small team of Japanese roboticists who recently left Tokyo University to develop a humanoid robot, and Industrial Perception, a start-up in Palo Alto that has developed computer vision systems and robot arms for loading and unloading trucks. Also acquired were Meka and Redwood Robotics, makers of humanoid robots and robot arms in San Francisco, and Bot &amp; Dolly, a maker of robotic camera systems that were recently used to create special effects in the movie ‘‘Gravity.’’ A related firm, Autofuss, which focuses on advertising and design, and Holomni, a small design firm that makes high-tech wheels, were acquired as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The seven companies are capable of creating technologies needed to build a mobile, dexterous robot. Mr. Rubin said he was pursuing additional acquisitions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unlike Google’s futuristic X lab, which does research on things like the driverless cars and the wearable Google Glass device, the robotics effort — moonshots aside — is meant to sell products sooner rather than later. It has not yet been decided whether the effort will be a new product group inside Google or a separate subsidiary, Mr. Rubin said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Google robotics group will initially be based in Palo Alto, with an office in Japan. In addition to his acquisitions, Mr. Rubin has begun hiring roboticists and is bringing in other Google programmers to assist in the project.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While Google has not detailed its long-term robotics plans, Mr. Rubin said there were both manufacturing and logistics markets that are not being served by today’s robotic technologies, and that they are clear opportunities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is not the first time that Google has strayed beyond the typical confines of a technology company. It has already shaken up the world’s automobile companies with its robot car project. Google has not yet publicly stated whether it intends to sell its own vehicles or become a supplier.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Document INHT000020131204e9c50006b</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_046.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark86">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark87">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">IBM’s Big Plans for Cloud Computing</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By QUENTIN HARDY</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">804 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 December 2013 NYT Blogs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

If any other company is thinking of entering the business, like China’s Tencent, for example, they’ll need to move fast or come up with something revolutionary.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IBM’s response? You ain’t seen nothing yet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/i-b-m-buys-cloud-computing-firm-in-deal-said-to-be-worth-2-billion/" class="s1" target="_blank">In 2014, the company will make a series of announcements that will shiver all challengers, according to Lance Crosby, chief executive of SoftLayer, a cloud computing company that </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/i-b-m-buys-cloud-computing-firm-in-deal-said-to-be-worth-2-billion/" class="a" target="_blank">IBM purchased earlier this year for $2</a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/i-b-m-buys-cloud-computing-firm-in-deal-said-to-be-worth-2-billion/" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/i-b-m-buys-cloud-computing-firm-in-deal-said-to-be-worth-2-billion/" class="a" target="_blank">billion</a><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/i-b-m-buys-cloud-computing-firm-in-deal-said-to-be-worth-2-billion/" class="s1" target="_blank">.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">More than 100 products, like e-commerce and marketing tools, will be put inside the cloud as a comprehensive series of offerings for business, Mr. Crosby said. So will another 40 infrastructure services, like big data analysis and mobile applications development.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It will take Amazon 10 years to build all of this,” he said. “People will be creating businesses with this that we can only dream about.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maybe. IBM already claims to lead in cloud computing revenue, with $1 billion in revenue in the past quarter alone. That’s impressive, though that revenue includes revenue from software that used to be attributed to a different category at the company. And some of the revenue is being generated by companies IBM recently acquired, including SoftLayer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On many other fronts, such as the number of machines it operates, the number of major companies running big parts of their business on IBM’s public cloud, and the new technology it appears to have built for cloud computing, IBM is arguably the laggard among the top four providers. As the SoftLayer purchase indicates, it has had to buy big for what the others have mostly grown internally.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What IBM does have, however, is a lot of money and resources it plans to throw at cloud computing. And given its experience in the early-1990s, when it faced a near-death experience after missing a major technology shift, the company may also have a belly for a swift change.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The big push will begin in February, Mr. Crosby said, with a formal inauguration of its new cloud offerings by Virginia M. Rometty, IBM’s chief executive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/" class="s1" target="_blank">IBM has also deployed </a><a href="http://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/" class="a" target="_blank">400 employees to OpenStack</a><a href="http://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/" class="s1" target="_blank">, an open source software project with more than </a><a href="http://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/" class="a" target="_blank">200</a><a href="http://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/" class="a" target="_blank">corporate members</a><a href="http://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a>that goes after much of the proprietary cloud systems of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. This seems much like IBM’s involvement a decade ago in Linux, which helped that open source operating system win corporate hearts and minds.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to the consolidation of online software and services, Mr. Crosby said, IBM is “absolutely” looking to sell its big mainframe computing capabilities as a cloud-based service. It also plans to draw on the insights it has gained from building and licensing technology used by Microsoft in the Xbox gaming console, and Google in its own network operations, he said, and will make more acquisitions for the cloud business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We make the processors in Google’s server racks,” he said, “We understand where gaming is going. Before I got here, I thought this was a big old tech company, too; I didn’t see all of the assets.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s true that IBM is big. And, it is also a tech company. And undeniably 102 years old, which makes it both a survivor and a creature of successful processes. Mr. Crosby has two bosses between him and Ms. Rometty, and numerous executive vice presidents above him that may agree on the eventual future, but have their own views about the speed with which they’ll move there.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/mainframe-computers-that-change-with-the-times/" class="a" target="_blank">Mainframe Computers That Change With the </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/mainframe-computers-that-change-with-the-times/" target="_blank">Times</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/oracle-and-salesforce-a-data-sharing-deal/" class="a" target="_blank">Oracle and Salesforce: a Data-Sharing </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/oracle-and-salesforce-a-data-sharing-deal/" target="_blank">Deal</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/i-b-m-inflates-its-cloud/" class="a" target="_blank">I.B.M.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The United States Supreme Court has let stand a ruling from New York’s highest court requiring Internet retailers to collect sales taxes even if they have no physical presence in the state.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As is their custom, the justices gave no reasons for their decision on Monday not to hear the case, which involved Amazon.com, the online giant, and a smaller competitor, Overstock.com. The two companies challenged a 2008 state law that required online companies to collect sales taxes on purchases made by New York residents.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brick-and-mortar companies often complain that they are put at a competitive disadvantage when they are required to collect sales taxes and online companies are not.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In March, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the companies had a sufficient presence in the state because of affiliated independent sites that linked to the retailers in return for a commission. ‘‘The bottom line,’’ the chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, wrote for the majority, ‘‘is that if a vendor is paying New York residents to actively solicit business in this state, there is no reason why that vendor should not shoulder the appropriate tax burden.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The chief judge added that it might be time to reconsider the basic rule that states may not collect taxes from out-of-state companies without some physical presence in the state, a principle recognized by the United States Supreme Court in its 1992 decision in Quill Corporation v. North Dakota.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The world has changed dramatically in the last two decades,’’ Chief Judge Lippman wrote, ‘‘and it may be that the physical presence test is outdated. An entity may now have a profound impact upon a foreign jurisdiction solely through its virtual projection via the Internet. That question, however, would be for the United States Supreme Court to consider.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Monday’s order indicated that such reconsideration must wait. The cases were Overstock.com v. New York Taxation Department, No. 13-252, and Amazon.com v. New York Taxation Department, No. 13-259.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a statement, Amazon urged Congress to act to impose a national solution. ‘‘The Supreme Court already has addressed the sales tax issue, saying in Quill that Congress can and should act to resolve it,’’ the statement said. ‘‘The Marketplace Fairness Act now pending before Congress would protect states’ rights to make their own revenue policy choices while allowing them to collect more than a fraction of the revenue that’s already owed.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For now, Amazon has been making some state-by-state accommodations. It has struck deals in several states to build warehouses in exchange for agreeing to collect taxes. According to its website, Amazon collects taxes in 16 states, including California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Texas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In asking the Supreme Court to step in, Theodore B. Olson, a lawyer for Amazon, wrote that ‘‘this case raises issues of exceptional importance.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The decision below,’’ he wrote, ‘‘leaves in place a state law that will significantly and unduly burden interstate commerce, provides a road map for other jurisdictions to inflict similar burdens on interstate commerce and threatens to sow widespread confusion in an area that is — in the best of times — already ‘something of a quagmire,’’’ he wrote, quoting from the Quill decision.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In urging the justices not to hear the cases, Barbara D. Underwood, New York’s solicitor general, wrote that the state law called for only simple fairness.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Although sales taxes are indisputably owed when a New York resident purchases goods from an out-of-state retailer for delivery in-state, the overwhelming majority of those purchases are never reported to the state taxing authorities, and hence taxes on them are never collected,’’ she wrote.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The law, she continued, ‘‘seeks to restore a level playing field between in-state brick-and-mortar stores and their out-of-state Internet-only counterparts.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020131203e9c40003h</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_049.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark92">finance</a><a name="bookmark93">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon delivers some timely pie in the sky; News Analysis</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID STREITFELD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,264 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 December 2013 International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">17</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hard to believe, but there was once a time when the visionaries worked for the government. Rebuilding a ruined Europe, putting a man on the moon, ending poverty, connecting the American interior with highways — these were immense tasks undertaken, and often achieved, by bureaucrats.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The wild dreamers these days work for technology companies. Elon Musk, not content with making the first commercially viable electric car, has a proposal for a trainlike system that would speed travelers at 600 miles, or 965 kilometers, an hour. Google, hard at work assembling the world’s information, has started a company to cheat death. Mark Zuckerberg has plans to put everyone in the world in touch.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And now Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, says he is planning to take what looks like a barbecue grill, attach eight propellers and a basket to it and use it to deliver small items to people’s houses. He sketched a vision where no one would ever have to get off a hammock for a resupply of Pringles or Milk Duds.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The announcement by Mr. Bezos on the American television news magazine program ‘‘60 Minutes’’ on Sunday was one of those moments when the future suddenly seemed much closer. But the news also served to emphasize a less appreciated hallmark of the technology world: its masterful use of public relations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Certainly Amazon, especially in Europe, would not mind changing the subject right now. Amazon warehouse workers are striking in Germany. The French are proposing to restrain the company with a law that forbids discounting on books. And in Britain, sending an undercover reporter to an Amazon warehouse is becoming routine. The most recent such investigation, which offered an indictment not only of Amazon but also of the workplace culture that makes it such a success, was published last weekend in The Guardian.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And so why not distract the world, if at least briefly, as Mr. Bezos seems to have done. Package delivery by drone is a loopy idea, far-fetched and the subject of instant mockery on Twitter — but it is hard to deny its audacity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I am blown away by what I see coming out of the private sector these days,’’ said Andrew McAfee, co-founder of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. ‘‘All the building blocks are in place for breakthroughs: The Internet goes everywhere. Everyone has a device connected to the network. And the cost of technology experimentation is so low. We don’t need one single entity with massive resources to deliver these really cool innovations.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The announcement by Mr. Bezos on Sunday evening came at the end of a ‘‘60 Minutes’’ feature about Amazon and its preparations for so-called Cyber Monday, the most hyped online shopping day in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘We can do half-hour delivery,’’ Mr. Bezos said. He also said the drones could carry as much as five pounds and could fly 10 miles from the delivery center. ‘‘I don’t want anybody to think this is just around the corner,’’ he said in an uncharacteristic note of caution.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Which brought up the immediate question: Why announce it now? Amazon is so tight-lipped it will not often confirm what happened in the past, like how many Kindles it has sold. It almost never talks about the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the show, Mr. Bezos dodged a question about whether Amazon would soon release a television set-top box. ‘‘I don’t want to talk about the future road map of our devices,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unless, apparently, he did want to.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Whether this ever amounts to anything, it was definitely a good P.R. move,’’ said Tory Patrick, leader of the retail technology practice at Walker Sands Communications, a consulting firm. ‘‘It’s Cyber Monday and Amazon is on the brain.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Beyond that — beyond Amazon’s meteoric stock price, its capacity to bring more goodies to more people in less time, its ceaseless innovation, its ability to make other retailers look hapless — the company is enduring an unusual period of criticism. Its success is breeding anger.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the Guardian article, Carole Cadwalladr wrote that her fellow workers used to be builders, hospitality managers, marketing graduates, carpenters and electricians.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘They owned their own businesses, and they were made redundant,’’ she added. ‘‘Or the business went bust. Or they had a stroke. Or their contract ended. They are people who had skilled jobs, or professional jobs, or just better-paying jobs. And now they work for Amazon, earning the minimum wage, and most of them are grateful to have that.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the United States, any resistance is much more muted. But Amazon fought back hard this fall against a new book, ‘‘The Everything Store’’ by Brad Stone, accusing it of containing an unbalanced depiction of the company as a brutal place to work.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The timing is interesting,’’ said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester. ‘‘The drones could be a game-changer — 20 years from now.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon webpage put up immediately after the ‘‘60 Minutes’’ broadcast was much more bold about the drone delivery service, which is called Prime Air. ‘‘We’ll be ready to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place,’’ Amazon promised.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That, it said, meant 2015, when the Federal Aviation Administration will issue new rules for commercial drones. The F.A.A. needed a year merely to prepare its 74-page plan for the integration of drones into the national airspace. Specific details on putting those rules into effect are still to come, the agency said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In fact, civilian use of drone aircraft so far meets fewer regulatory obstacles in Europe than in the United States. While the European Union, like the F.A.A., is trying to map out rules, individual countries — including Britain, France and Germany — are taking their own approaches, in many cases even encouraging drone development. So far, nearly 1,000 unmanned vehicles are authorized to fly commercially in and around a dozen European countries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said he was dissatisfied with the F.A.A. plan because he felt it had scant privacy protections. ‘‘Clear rules must be set that protect the privacy and safety of the public,’’ he said in a statement on Monday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jaron Lanier, a technology skeptic who wrote ‘‘You Are Not a Gadget,’’ said the drones would encourage the sort of divisions that undermine society.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘I can easily picture a scenario where drones deliver things to upscale tech-savvy customers,’’ he said. ‘‘But note the implication, whether intended or not, that working-class truck drivers will no longer transgress geographic class lines.

An apartment in central Illinois might be worth 20 times as much in Manhattan, because a Manhattan apartment gives its resident access to many more goods, activities and high-paying jobs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This is not to say that urban living is always the best, or that all urban properties are created equal. Locations involve trade-offs, and rural areas offer amenities that big cities cannot. But for centuries, real estate markets have shown that people and businesses are willing to pay more for urban properties.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2013/08/41509/from-the-north-fork-to-nyc-commuters-tell-their-stories/" class="s1" target="_blank">As technology helps with moving goods and people more cheaply, it might seem that urban real estate would give up some of its price premium because distance becomes less of an obstacle to economic transactions. Wouldn’t a driverless car cause some workers to sell their Manhattan apartments and commute to their jobs from more spacious homes in the suburbs or even </a>rural New York State<span class="p">?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But don’t forget that many people and businesses currently avoid urban areas because of the monthly expense of owning or renting urban property. New technologies might allow them to use urban properties on a part-time basis, or use less urban property to accomplish the same tasks, which would make urban property more valuable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A restaurant may need less refrigeration and storage space because it takes multiple food deliveries per day. Grocery stores may save on shelf space by having a greater fraction of their items delivered directly to customers without being shelved in the store. Households may opt for less storage space or parking, for example — and more room for people — when they can get items and transportation cheaply and on time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For every Manhattan resident who leaves his apartment for the suburbs, there could be many others for whom technology induces them to use a Manhattan property on a part-time basis.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">New technologies are more likely to emerge in urban areas, because that’s where the innovators expect to find the most customers.

It’s a striking vision, but it seems as overly optimistic as investors’ expectations of the company over all. Amazon’s market value has ballooned to $180 billion, despite big profits always hovering in the future.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drone technology has advanced tremendously over the past decade because of improvements in software, robotics and networking. The use of these unmanned vehicles is already common in the military, and cheap, fast and automated shipping could benefit all kinds of businesses. Mr. Bezos says Amazon could use drones within four or five years, delivering goods weighing less than five pounds inside 30 minutes.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_aviation_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org" class="s1" target="_blank">It’s perhaps fitting that a long-term thinker like Mr. Bezos should be testing the boundaries of what’s possible. But at best, it’s a long way off. The </a><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_aviation_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org" class="a" target="_blank">Federal Aviation Administration</a> <span style=" color: #000;">may start allowing commercial drones to operate in 2015, but widespread use is likely to come only many years later. Letting robots fly freely in densely populated areas poses all kinds of safety, security and privacy questions – never mind logistical challenges and concerns that hackers or old-fashioned villains might intercept the vehicles or the packages they carry.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos has always made clear that he runs Amazon with the goal of rapid growth while maximizing profit over the long run. Getting everyone to talk about his company on Cyber Monday, the most important day of the year for online shopping, will help accomplish the former. Analysts expect Amazon’s revenue to be around $75 billion this year, 23 percent more than last.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=TRI&amp;inline=nyt-org" class="s1" target="_blank">But it’s still not clear when Amazon will deliver normal, never mind supernormal, profitability.

He showed Charlie Rose a video of a tiny helicopter seizing a package from a warehouse and airlifting it to a house. The drone then took off again.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has already named its future delivery system Prime Air. “I know this looks like science fiction,” Mr. Bezos said. “It’s not.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, even the hyper-optimistic Mr. Bezos cautioned that there were “years of additional work from this point.” He told the show the hardest challenge would be convincing the Federal Aviation Administration that this is a good idea.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, the F.A.A. and everyone else. The commercial use of drones was legalized early in 2012, but there has been a good deal of outcry about drones possibly being used for surveillance. Some communities are banning local police from using drones. How receptive they would be to e-commerce applications is unclear.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ref_=tsm_1_tw_s_amzn_mx3eqp&amp;node=8037720011" class="a" target="_blank">An Amazon promotional page</a> <span style=" color: #000;">for Prime Air, however, said the delivery system was practically a done deal.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“From a technology point of view, we’ll be ready to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place,” the company said. It said that could be two years away.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No mention was made of what would happen if you live in an apartment. Or whether you would get your money back if your neighbor shot down your delivery.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Or, as Mr. Bezos said: “The hard part here is putting in all the redundancy, all the reliability, all the systems you need to say, ‘Look, this thing can’t land on somebody’s head while they’re walking around their neighborhood.’” He later added, “That’s not good.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If Amazon could do it, so presumably could Walmart and the many other retailers trying to do same-day delivery. It might bring a whole new meaning to the phrase “e-commerce wars.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The general reaction among Amazon-watchers, however, was that Amazon had scored a significant P.R. coup. “60 Minutes” had teased the revelation over the weekend, setting Twitter afire.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://twitter.com/scottEweinberg" class="s1" target="_blank">“Does @Amazon sell pets?

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A FEW years ago, one of my graduate students showed me a Google Earth image that changed my view of the world. On a photo showing all of South America, I could clearly see a single soybean farm in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. My first thought was that a farm that big, sitting on the edge of the Amazon, must be an environmental disaster. But when it comes to agricultural sustainability, all is not what it seems.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite what you might hear at your local farmers’ market or Whole Foods, not all big farms are bad. Nor are all small organic farms sustainable. They may produce high-quality food, but if they don’t produce a lot of calories per acre, they are doing little to help increase the global food supply. How we increase this supply over the next few decades will determine agriculture’s sustainability. It’s worth exploring why this is so, because sustainable food production is a fundamental human need. Getting it right will require us to carefully assess the consequences of where and how we farm.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Already, the world’s farms take up an area the size of South America. By 2050, a global population of nearly 10 billion people will require roughly 70 percent more food. We have two options: Either we need to get more food out of the land we already farm, or we need to farm more land.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nowhere are farmers pursuing the first option faster than in Mato Grosso. Last January I decided to see the consequences for myself. After a long flight from Boston, I rode the night bus nearly 500 miles of rutted roads to reach the frontier town of Canarana. Only about 25,000 people live here, but the main street has several stores selling million-dollar tractors. Waiting for my ride to the farm, I met a man from Silicon Valley who commutes every month to sell heavy equipment. He told me, “This is where the money is.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How can we determine if these farms are sustainable? Admittedly, it’s unnerving to stand in an endless sea of soybeans where there was once rain forest. Exotic animals like tapirs, jaguars and rheas wander through the monocrop desert, and macaws compete for airspace with crop dusters. But sustainability has little to do with appearances. Sustainability depends on whether a farm can continue to produce food over the long term, without irreparably damaging the environment or causing other land to be cleared in the quest for increased food production.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the past five years, my students, colleagues and I have been trying to understand the sustainability of these giant soy farms. Although I typically work on tropical forests and the soils that sustain them, the fate of the forests I love is intimately intertwined with the way people use them. When colleagues suggested that I come to Mato Grosso to see this bustling agricultural frontier, I jumped at the chance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We focused first on fertilizer. Fertilizer helps grow more food on a given plot of land, but overuse can have serious environmental consequences. Largely, these depend on how efficiently farms use nitrogen and phosphorus.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These two elements, which limit how much crops can grow, are the main components of fertilizer. Crops don’t absorb all the fertilizer farmers apply, and what’s left behind often ends up in waterways, where it fuels algae growth. Fifty years of heavy fertilizer use in the breadbaskets of the United States and Europe has left lakes, rivers and coasts with algae-choked “dead zones.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We expected the story to be similar in Mato Grosso. But to our surprise, we’ve found that streams draining the farms there have no more nitrogen or phosphorus than those in adjacent forests. The deep tropical soils are highly efficient filters, removing nutrients before they reach the water. In the American Midwest, scientists have long been searching for ways to clean up farm runoff. In Mato Grosso, the soils do the work.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But these same soils present a sustainability concern on a different front. After millions of years of heavy rainfall, Mato Grosso’s soils have lost nearly all their phosphorus. The soils efficiently remove phosphorus before it reaches the streams but also bind phosphorus added as fertilizer, leaving less for the crops. As a result, farms here require twice as much phosphorus fertilizer as their counterparts in more temperate regions, where the soils are younger and more fertile. And phosphate ore, the source of phosphorus fertilizer, is a finite resource.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16101666" class="s1" target="_blank">The world’s phosphorus reserves are held by a handful of countries — the exact distribution is disputed, but possibly half of it is in Morocco alone. Much of Morocco’s phosphate ore is carried 61 miles across the Western Sahara to the Atlantic, on the </a><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16101666" class="a" target="_blank">world’s longest conveyor belt</a> <span style=" color: #000;">. A farm might not be sustainable if it depended on political stability in faraway countries. And how should we weigh the negative of phosphorus depletion against the positive of reduced water pollution? We don’t yet know the answers.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fertilizer story makes it complicated to figure out the sustainability of Mato Grosso’s farms, which send their soy to China, as animal feed, and to Europe. Even more complicated is the question of how these farms will affect the global climate. The link, while not obvious, is important. Global warming results largely from burning fossil fuels. But another important contributor — about 15 percent of our carbon-dioxide emissions — comes from changing land use, primarily the burning of tropical rain forests to make room for food or biofuel crops. If we really want to know the environmental impact of these soy farms, we need to understand their effect on carbon-dioxide emissions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural science alone cannot answer this question, so I increasingly find myself talking to economists and sociologists. Because at the end of the day, the carbon footprint of these farms will depend on whether their economic success leads to more deforestation. If so, their carbon footprint will be huge. This would be a deathblow to their sustainability.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the other hand, these soy fields produce more calories than the low-productivity pastures they replaced. Remember options one and two: To feed a growing population we will need to either farm more land, or to get more food out of the land we farm. Either option will need to be coupled with efforts to reduce food waste and to feed fewer crops to animals.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For now, deforestation rates in Mato Grosso have slowed, as pastures have been converted to soy. It may be that megafarms, unlike the small-scale landholders they replace, are more reticent to take on the sanctions that come with illegal deforestation, though there are certainly other potential explanations. We don’t know if the slowdown in deforestation will continue. If it does, and if big soy is a reason, one could argue that these fields are a boon to the global environment far greater than your local organic farm.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One thing is clear: In the coming decades we will need to produce a lot more food. I’m not suggesting Mato Grosso’s farms are the answer, far from it. But it’s time to move beyond the oversimplification that large-scale agriculture is incompatible with environmental goals. There are vast areas of the tropics with similar soils. They are likely to be the megafarms of the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We need to admit that food production is going to be the dominant use of land in the 21st century, and to decide whether we are going to farm more land or farm more intensively. Then we can move on to the grand challenge of making our farms sustainable.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Stephen Porder is an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Brown University.

In every case, he said, Amazon Web Services had developed ways to make its computers run cheaper and more efficiently than standard commercial products.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We’re changing everything everywhere,” said James Hamilton, vice president and distinguished engineer at Amazon Web Services. “All of our engineers are focused” on reducing the costs of computing. He was speaking at Amazon’s second annual gathering of A.W.S. customers, partner companies and analysts, an event that drew 9,000 people.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Amazon, which rarely talks about Amazon Web Services, it was an unusually frank and detailed explanation of a system on which the company is thought to spend perhaps $1 billion annually (Amazon officials would not confirm this number, but did not dispute it when asked directly.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s data storage system, Mr. Hamilton said, handles 1.5 million requests a second, and holds trillions of “objects,” or individual stored items. Its custom-built storage machines pack their systems far more densely than the most advanced commercial systems, he said, and weigh over a ton. The first database system he’d worked on professionally, Mr. Hamilton said, was considered cutting edge when it ran 69 transactions a second.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.W.S. has built power substations with capacity in excess of 50 megawatts to have sufficient power for the computing it expects to have within two years. Amazon has hired power engineers to rethink power redundancy in cloud computing.

On the weekend, too,” Mr. Hamilton said.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/microsoft-the-cloud-cant-be-slave-to-the-past/" class="s1" target="_blank">In part, the talk was an acknowledgement that large competitors like </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/microsoft-the-cloud-cant-be-slave-to-the-past/" class="a" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/google-let-a-billion-supercomputers-bloom/" class="s1" target="_blank">and </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/google-let-a-billion-supercomputers-bloom/" class="a" target="_blank">Google</a> <span style=" color: #000;">are now gunning for</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.W.S. With competitors, Amazon now has to engage in a customer outreach that fronts Amazon’s technical prowess.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Big public cloud computing “is such an obviously good market that we know every major player will be in it,” he said. “We still want all the jobs on A.W.S.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Hamilton also stressed that global clouds operated with a scale and velocity that enables efficiencies individual companies can’t get running their own cloud systems. For example, by handling the peak loads of tax preparers in April and the peak loads of retailers in December, A.W.S. servers run at a higher and more efficient rate, annualized, than any individual company can realize.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/vmware-killed-the-past-can-it-claim-the-future/" class="s1" target="_blank">This was an indirect attack on </a>VMware<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/for-dell-consolidation-is-innovation/" class="s1" target="_blank">, </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/for-dell-consolidation-is-innovation/" class="a" target="_blank">Dell</a><span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">and other companies offering private clouds to corporations.

Currently no major commercial networking company consistently achieves that sustained cost performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While it’s possible that Amazon will continue its openness and share its discoveries with the world. Mr. Hamilton also said Amazon was not interested in participating in industry standards discussions, which could publicize its many technical advances.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Standards say, ‘you must do this,’” he said. “We don’t like ‘you must.’”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In fairness, Google publishes some technical papers about its big computers, but does not talk about things like the semiconductors it has developed internally to handle computing at this scale. There are so few companies able to operate that this level that every aspect of systems, even electricity usage, is considered by these companies to be potentially significant proprietary knowledge.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/facebooks-other-big-disruption/" class="s1" target="_blank">The notable outrider among the giant computers is </a>Facebook<span class="p">, which isn’t selling its own system.

All rights reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LAS VEGAS — Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing part of Amazon’s sprawling online empire, is known for its globe-spanning system of millions of computer servers, data storage systems and complex software, estimated to be five times larger than 14 other cloud computing providers combined.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Wednesday Amazon indicated that its ambitions were potentially much bigger — it wants to provide desktop computing to all the mobile devices in the world and remake mobile gaming.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At a developer conference in Las Vegas, A.W.S. announced Amazon WorkSpaces, a way to provide applications, documents and computing resources to laptops and tablets, including iPads, Android tablets and Amazon Kindle Fires. Prices vary from $35 to $60 a month per user, depending on how much computing power and storage someone wants. A license for Microsoft Office and some antivirus software is another $15 a month per person.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s hard to say just how many tech companies Amazon is rattling with this one. Google, with its Chromebooks and Google Drive, which already offer cheap ways to do computing online, is one candidate. Microsoft is selling licenses, but potentially losing out on operating system revenue, if this succeeds.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All the major makers of personal computers and, yes, laptops, could also be affected if someone makes an Android-based desktop terminal that could be sold as a cheap way to equip call centers or offices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“No hardware, no software, no long-term commitments,” said Andy Jassy, the head of A.W.S. “You can access this at half the price of a typical infrastructure desktop solution.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is not a slam dunk, however. While virtual desktops are on the market, usually offered as a way to give information technology departments a lot of low-cost centralized control, in general the systems have not sold well. Even Google’s Chrome desktop product has disappointed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The product will come out in limited release, probably meaning A.W.S. wants to see how well it can operate these systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The other new business, called Amazon AppStream, enables developers of mobile games to deliver what Amazon said was the consistent streaming experience of high-quality gaming — the kind associated with a Microsoft Xbox or a Sony PlayStation — to a smartphone or tablet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using AppStream, A.W.S. examines a device’s characteristics and connectivity, and according to the company will be able to send even complex, three-dimensional games to a user in a consistent manner. Like WorkSpaces, the service will start out in limited release.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">AppStream is one of several mobile development offerings that A.W.S. has been rolling out over the last couple of years, including data analytics, ad networks for mobile devices and purchasing systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While currently limited to mobile development, many of these services could conceivably reach other businesses, like Web page development and virtual desktops, with relatively modest modifications.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is the kind of thing Amazon has done before, starting with A.W.S.’s origins as a service for Amazon’s own operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thursday morning, A.W.S. also announced tweaks to its databases that it said would make gaming, mobile and ad placement technology faster and more powerful.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/g-e-s-industrial-internet-goes-big/" class="a" target="_blank">G.E.’s ‘Industrial Internet’ Goes </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/g-e-s-industrial-internet-goes-big/" target="_blank">Big</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/the-cloud-era-begins-for-enterprise-tech/" class="a" target="_blank">The Cloud Era Begins for Enterprise </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/the-cloud-era-begins-for-enterprise-tech/" target="_blank">Tech</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/a-shifting-workplace-experience/" class="a" target="_blank">A Shifting Workplace </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/a-shifting-workplace-experience/" target="_blank">Experience</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/tech-rivals-lay-down-arms-for-youth-coding/" class="a" target="_blank">Tech Rivals Lay Down Arms for Youth </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/tech-rivals-lay-down-arms-for-youth-coding/" target="_blank">Coding</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/daily-report-europe-weighs-regulations-for-cloud-computing/" class="a" target="_blank">Daily Report: Europe Weighs Regulations for Cloud </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/daily-report-europe-weighs-regulations-for-cloud-computing/" target="_blank">Computing</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Andy Jassy, the head of Amazon Web Services. | Andy Jassy, the head of Amazon Web Services.

Is he independently wealthy?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bharara demurred. “Not compared to the people in this room,” he said, to an auditorium filled with business people.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While he did not discuss his own wealth directly, Mr. Bharara said his brother, Vinnie, tends to pay for dinner when they go out, ever since he “came into a little bit of cash.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I got it,” Vinnie Bharara said at a dinner recently, according to Preet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition, the prosecutor touched on some familiar themes, such as the importance of holding institutions — and not just individuals — accountable for wrongdoing.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cash-short United States Postal Service, which has failed to win congressional approval to stop delivering mail on Saturdays to save money, has struck a deal with Amazon.com to deliver the company’s packages on Sundays — a first for both, with obvious advantages for each.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the Postal Service, which last year reported a loss of nearly $16 billion, first-class mail delivery, particularly on Saturdays, is often a money loser, whereas package delivery is profitable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The deal, announced on Sunday and taking effect immediately, in time for the holiday shopping season, gives the Postal Service a chance to take some business from United Parcel Service and FedEx, which do not deliver on Sundays. Now, some orders that would have been handled by either of those carriers for Monday delivery will go through the Postal Service and arrive on Sunday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Postal Service said it expected to make more such deals with other merchants, seeking a larger role in the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$186 billion market for electronic commerce. Amazon.com would not say whether it would try to arrange Sunday deliveries with other parcel carriers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For this holiday shopping season, Sunday delivery of Amazon products will be limited to the Los Angeles and New York metropolitan areas, which in New York’s case includes parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. In 2014, it is expected to expand to other cities including Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Among the primary beneficiaries of the new delivery schedule will be Amazon Prime members, who pay an annual fee for premium services including free two-day shipping for certain items, said Kelly Cheeseman, a spokeswoman for Amazon. ‘‘Now every day can be an Amazon delivery day,’’ she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Postal Service officials called the agreement an important step in diversifying its services and expanding those that make a profit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Consumers have shown that there is a market for package deliveries seven days a week, and we are glad to be in a position to partner with Amazon on providing this service,’’ said Patrick R. Donahoe, the postmaster general.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Neither Amazon nor the Postal Service would disclose financial arrangements or discuss the volume or revenue they expected to generate from Sunday deliveries. The Postal Service already delivers some packages on Sundays and holidays for an extra fee.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shipping and package services have been one of the few bright spots for the beleaguered Postal Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First-class mail, its main source of revenue, declined to almost 69 billion pieces last year from nearly 92 billion in 2008.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That contributed to a decline in revenue to $65 billion in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 2012, from nearly</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$75 billion in 2008. Shipping and package volume has increased to about 3.5 billion pieces since 2008, and accounts for about $11.6 billion in revenue for the agency.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Donahoe, the postmaster general, said the deal with Amazon was part of the Postal Service’s attempt to alter its business model. That effort includes increasing package delivery to take advantage of the growth of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-commerce, streamlining the work force and eliminating mail delivery on Saturdays.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though the Postal Service would continue to deliver packages on Saturdays, the proposal to halt Saturday delivery has met resistance from the business sector and some members of Congress. A move to cut Saturday delivery would save about $2 billion annually, postal officials said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The agency faces myriad problems that have led to its financial decline. It faces legal constraints that prevent it from diversifying into certain lines of business. It is also barred from raising postage prices faster than the rate of inflation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But an even bigger cause of the financial decline is a 2006 law that requires the Postal Service, unlike any other government agency, to pay $5.5 billion a year into a health fund for its future retirees.

The booksellers would get a small payment on each sale and a commission on all e-books that the reader buys in the next two years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was a great deal, booksellers said — for Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I seriously doubt that many independent stores will take them up on it,” said Bill Petrocelli, co-owner of two stores in the Bay Area.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/a-new-book-portrays-amazon-as-bully/" class="s1" target="_blank">Many booksellers are distrustful of Amazon, a company of boundless ambition and </a>some aggressive ways<span class="p">. Stores dismissed the new program as a Trojan horse aimed at further undermining their business. Independents make up about 10 percent of book sales, down from as much as 25 percent before Amazon.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We help Amazon grow its business and, in return, get a thin slice of the sale?” asked J. B. Dickey at Seattle Mystery Bookshop. “That’s not cooperation. That’s being complicit in your execution.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jason Bailey, co-owner of another Washington store, JJ Books in Bothell, had a more nuanced view. He has already signed up with the program and was featured on Wednesday on the Amazon site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I have people coming in with their e-book readers to look at my books and then buy them online,” Mr. Bailey said in an interview. “I may have helped sell the book, but I generated income for someone else. Now I have a chip in the game.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokeswoman, Kinley Pearsall, said she did not have the total number of retailers in the program. (One other bookstore, a college store in Washington, was featured on the site.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I can tell you anecdotally that the interest we’ve seen since announcing this morning has been very strong,” Ms. Pearsall said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has lost valuable real estate for its Kindle line of e-readers in recent years, as its brick-and-mortar competitors have dropped the devices from their stores. Last year, both Target and Walmart said they would no longer sell the Kindle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new program, Amazon Source, lets stores either buy Kindles for a 6 percent discount and receive 10 percent of the revenue from e-books that customers purchase, or gives them a 9 percent discount without any other payment. The cheapest Kindle is $69. Most e-books are about $12, although many self-published ones are much less or even free.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s aggressive discounting of physical books as well as its creation of an e-book empire have helped thin the ranks of independent bookstores over the last decade. But the stores scored at least a temporary victory with the lackluster performance of Amazon’s publishing program, which offered up a handful of big names to weak sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One reason: The independents refused to sell the books.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon portrayed Amazon Source as a win for both parties. “Customers don’t have to choose between e-books and their favorite neighborhood bookstore — they can have both,” an executive, Russ Grandinetti, said in a news release.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But even Mr. Bailey, who got early word of the program through a soccer buddy who works at Amazon, sees risks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I had to debate whether this is the next nail in my coffin, the next step down into the grave,” he said. Switching metaphors, he added, “But I decided to step into the whirlwind.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His hope is that a customer will buy a Kindle from him, and yet remain a customer for physical books in forms that are not yet popular in electronic formats: children’s books, for example. His three-year-old store will get a modest but presumably steady commission on e-book purchases.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other bookstore owners said any potential income was negligible, but the potential problems were enormous. When stores sell a Kobo reader, for example, customers can buy their e-books directly from the store itself, creating a tighter relationship. But when a customer buys a Kindle, the e-books come from Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another problem is letting Amazon scoop up even more data about who is buying what.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Our customers are buying e-books from us that are way more eclectic than people are buying from Amazon,” said Michael Tucker, owner of Books Inc., a San Francisco chain of 12 stores. “Giving away that information would be like giving away the farm for a nickel.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has had some public relations setbacks recently. An in-depth look at the company by Brad Stone, a former New York Times reporter, written with official cooperation, presented a view of Amazon as a Darwinian snake pit. This week Amazon fired back, denouncing “The Everything Store” as one-sided.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With that as a backdrop, booksellers were not inclined to see any proposal from Amazon in a benign light.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I was kind of wondering if it was April Fools’ Day,” said Karen Hayes, a co-owner of Parnassus Books in Nashville.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">David Streitfeld reported from San Francisco and Julie Bosman from New York.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon wants independent bookstores to sell its Kindles. | J.

Mr. Stone, the author, is a senior writer for Bloomberg Businessweek and a former reporter for The New York Times.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Ms. Bezos’s review, which is the only one-star review of “The Everything Store,” she accused Mr. Stone of making factual errors and, noting that Mr. Bezos was “never interviewed for this book,” took issue with Mr. Stone’s use of the phrases “Bezos believed” and “Bezos felt.” Readers, she wrote, should “take note of how seldom these guesses about his feelings and motives are marked with a footnote indicating there is any other source to substantiate them.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Mr. Stone did not interview Mr. Bezos specifically for his book, he spoke to him periodically over the years and said that he interviewed more than 300 people who work or previously worked at Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sarah Gelman, a spokeswoman for Amazon, confirmed that the review was written by Ms. Bezos but declined to comment further.

It’s a small bet by a very big company, but one that could create additional momentum for the further disruption of what we still call television but is quickly becoming something more complicated and interesting.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/garden/18roomies.html?_r=0" class="s1" target="_blank">The program is loosely based on </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/garden/18roomies.html?_r=0" class="a" target="_blank">a house that served as a crash pad</a> <span style=" color: #000;">for four Democrats in Washington, including Senators Charles E.

Durbin, and Representatives George Miller and Bill Delahunt.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Except on “Alpha House,” the four men are all senators, all Republicans and all flawed in ways that give the comedy impulse plenty of room to roam.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tea_party_movement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" class="s1" target="_blank">Mr. Goodman’s character, Gil John Biggs, is a revered former basketball coach of the University of North Carolina Tar Heels and now a Republican senator from that state who is confronting a </a><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tea_party_movement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" class="a" target="_blank">Tea Party</a> <span style=" color: #000;">challenge from Digger Mancusi, the current Duke coach.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a scene filmed last month, Mr. Biggs is bathing in post-gaffe regret — we will avoid spoilers here — trying to deal with a video gone “virile,” as he describes it. When an aide tells him there are in fact six deeply embarrassing videos making the rounds on the Internet, Mr. Biggs’s face becomes a portrait of hatred for this modern age.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He swears lustily, and then moans, “It’s like the Clemson game all over again!” After his wife and aide suggest that he go on a morning show as part of an apology tour, he swears again, and says, “I don’t need to humanize myself! I’m plenty human.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Washington’s feet of clay are all the rage on television right now — there’s “Scandal” on ABC, “Veep” on HBO and, of course, “House of Cards” — but another trend is afoot. Big Internet players like Netflix and Amazon are stepping up their efforts in original programming, competing for viewers in the world of streaming.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the instances of “House of Cards” and “Alpha House,” they are even presenting the same general subject matter, albeit taking different approaches — “House of Cards” is a whodunit-to-whom drama while “Alpha House” is full-contact comedy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The reasons are obvious, even if the economics are a little opaque. Both companies want a substantial footprint on your various devices, and to be part of the television ecosystem, they decided they had to make “television.” In doing so, they become less of a hostage to the traditional content providers while putting consumers on notice that interesting television, if that is what it is, can come from all kinds of places.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That lesson had to be learned by content creators as well. “Alpha House” had been percolating for a while with Mr. Trudeau, who wrote “Tanner 88” for HBO. He and Jonathan Alter, the journalist and author, have been taking trips to the New Hampshire primary for the last 20 years, and the concept came up again in 2012. Mr. Alter took the idea to Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I had no interest in making YouTube videos and didn’t really understand that Amazon was getting into full-fledged productions,” Mr. Trudeau said. “It soon became clear that they were willing to put significant resources into original content.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/for-house-of-cards-using-big-data-to-guarantee-its-popularity.html" class="s1" target="_blank">The business models — and the marquee programs — of Netflix and Amazon bear surface similarities, but different agendas are at work. Netflix is a pure-play entertainment company that </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/for-house-of-cards-using-big-data-to-guarantee-its-popularity.html" class="a" target="_blank">uses data, licensed content and</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/for-house-of-cards-using-big-data-to-guarantee-its-popularity.html" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/for-house-of-cards-using-big-data-to-guarantee-its-popularity.html" class="a" target="_blank">streaming distribution</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/for-house-of-cards-using-big-data-to-guarantee-its-popularity.html" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a>to build an audience of subscribers — similar to cable, but without the actual cable. “House of Cards,” “Orange Is the New Black” and other original shows help the company keep subscribers happy and earn new ones. In that sense, the programming, or the play, is the thing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Amazon, programming is an add-on, a benefit of being a member of Amazon Prime. In addition to free two-day shipping, the company’s 11 million Prime members have access to Amazon Prime Instant Video, with more than 40,000 movies and television episodes, and beginning next week, “Alpha House.” The first three episodes will be available on Nov. 15, free to all Amazon customers, and additional episodes will then be available to subscribers of Amazon Prime every week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lest you think Amazon is simply being generous, it is important to note that Prime members reportedly spend 150 percent more on the site after joining. You get the drift: Come for “Alpha House” and stick around to buy a big new flat-screen to watch it on.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://variety.com/2013/biz/news/step-aside-netflix-amazons-entering-the-original-series-race-1200749146/" class="s1" target="_blank">It’s not cheap or easy to make content.

It’s part of </a>the so-called flywheel effect<span class="p">, a business theory that suggests that adding small features to a core business</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">— in Amazon’s case, selling millions of products online — makes the wheel spin faster, helping you add customers and achieve efficiencies through increased scale.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The strategy — programming as a throw-in bonus for consumers — has the potential to complicate the industry enormously, but Amazon’s approach is unorthodox as well. The big networks engage in a hugely inefficient pilot process — by the time executives finish choosing the handful of programs that will be broadcast, the aftermath looks like an episode of “Walking Dead,” with very expensive carcasses littering the landscape.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon instead used its reach — it has 215 million customers worldwide — to create a vast focus group. In the spring, the company made 14 pilots available for viewing and rating. “Alpha House” ended up highly rated enough for a crowd-sourced green light, along with “Betas,” a comedy about a start-up in Silicon Valley. (Insert your own joke here about the first two original series being named Alpha and Beta.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The data part of it is basically a black box to us,” Mr. Trudeau said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I was flabbergasted by their mode of decision-making, that we were going to put something out there as troll bait, but they generated the numbers and have entrusted me with what is equivalent to a midsized corporation, so I guess the kingdom of Big Data came back positive.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was more than that, said Roy Price, director of Amazon Studios.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We try to put together some of the things from traditional TV and Amazon’s tradition of listening to customers, so in that sense, it is a hybrid,” he said. “With ‘Alpha House,’ a lot of people responded to the cast and Garry’s sense of humor. It’s a comedy that brings insights into a world people are familiar with, and it clearly resonated with Amazon Prime customers.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Alter said it represented a shift of sorts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“In the end, it’s sort of refreshing, taking some of the power away from the suits and letting people help decide,” he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, it’s more or less the same to the people in front of the camera, including Mr. Goodman, who broke through as the sitcom husband on “Roseanne.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“This one has a different distribution platform, but this,” he said, gesturing around to the crew, the equipment and the sets, “is a TV show.

It was 10 p.m. and many of the women huddled in the darkness were toting sleepy children; most were also burdened with plastic bags of Pop Tarts, pretzels, cookies and potato chips — junk food unavailable to men behind bars.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The team from Sendapackage, which could be thought of as prison’s version of Amazon.com, was handing out glossy catalogs offering New York’s 50,000 inmates hundreds of items for purchase and delivery: soft drinks, cigarettes, canned ravioli, cotton hoodies and — perhaps most popular of all — music on cassette tape, the only format that corrections regulations will allow.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://sendapackage.tv/" class="s1" target="_blank">“We’ve got same-day shipping and a 10 percent discount on first-time orders,” the team’s coordinator, Zerimar Ramirez (or Mr. Z), was telling the group. As some of the women flipped with interest through the product line, a video crew stood ready if any of them cared to go on camera and provide a </a>testimonial<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though it might surprise many who have no experience with prison, sending packages to loved ones doing time can be, as thousands of local families know, a Kafkaesque process. Beyond the hassle of going to several stores to assemble a package, and then having to take it to the post office or UPS, is navigating a welter of rules governing what is allowable.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/11/03/nyregion/prisons-document.html" class="s1" target="_blank">The New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision publishes a </a>list<span class="p">, currently more than 20 pages long, of who can send what, and how, and what is permitted and what is not. Food cannot contain poppy seeds; emery boards must be “nonmetallic”; boxer shorts and briefs must be of a solid color only.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I thought there had to be a better way,” said Chris Barrett, Sendapackage’s founder, who seems to have discovered that way on the Internet. The items that Mr. Barrett’s service sells online (as well as through its catalog) have all been chosen in advance to adhere to the extensive directives put in place for gifts by the corrections department. His selection is comprehensive and diverse enough that the company bills itself as “New York’s inmate superstore.”</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.brooklynda.org/press_releases/2008/pr_may_08.htm" class="s1" target="_blank">In a city that appears more and more to be colonized by corporate-funded start-ups, Sendapackage, which is two years old, has an exceptionally personal creation myth. The idea came to Mr. Barrett in 2008, not long after his younger brother, Robert Maffei, was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for a murder in Brooklyn. When he was 19, Mr. Maffei </a><a href="http://www.brooklynda.org/press_releases/2008/pr_may_08.htm" class="a" target="_blank">killed a man</a> <span style=" color: #000;">after firing a pistol from a moving car. After he was put away, Mr. Barrett, who had himself served six years on a mob-related gun charge, tried to send him some deodorant and a package of salami at the Sullivan Correctional Facility, in Fallsburg.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Barrett was unaware that the items had been made with alcohol, which is forbidden inside prison. As he recounts the story, a guard disposed of his well-intentioned gifts as soon as they arrived.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Eventually I started hearing that other people — wives and moms who didn’t know the rules, who didn’t have time to go shopping — were having the same problem,” Mr. Barrett said. “I began to sense there was a need here, a real need.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though he had worked in marketing and been a nightclub co-owner after his release from prison, Mr. Barrett at that point had no experience as a digital entrepreneur. So he took a year, he said, pricing items, building a website and developing relationships with vendors — “Everything we needed,” he explained, “to pitch the idea.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In late 2010, after several months of looking for an angel, he finally persuaded a Brooklyn businessman to fund his nascent venture with a personal check for $1.5 million.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.chefboyardee.com/pastas/beefaroni" class="s1" target="_blank">Within six months, Mr. Barrett had rented space in a warehouse in the Bronx and quickly filled its shelves with basic items: brushed-twill baseball caps, cans of </a>Beefaroni<span class="p">. As time went by, he added to his inventory, gradually expanding into watches, gummi bears, stereo headphones and exfoliating moisturizing creams.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last year, he struck what was his biggest and most promising deal to date, persuading Universal Records to produce, on cassette, a line of new music popular with inmates. Compact discs are not allowed in prison because they can be broken into shivs. But arguing that he had access to an audience that was literally captive, Mr. Barrett persuaded Universal to manufacture a limited supply of R&amp;B and hip-hop tapes, in an exclusive arrangement, provided that he bought them on consignment and in bulk.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“No one makes cassette tapes anymore,” Mr. Barrett said, still sounding vaguely amazed. “I’m probably the only guy on the planet with Kanye West’s new album on tape.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Judging by the letters he has received, Mr. Barrett, who is slim of build and 40, has managed to transform himself into something like the R. H. Macy of the state prison system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“While looking through your catalog, a couple of things caught my eye,” one customer, in the Downstate Correctional Facility, wrote. “Your prices, which are very reasonable, and your wide selection of things, such as sneakers, boots, headsets, blankets, winter coats, thermals, books, TVs, radios, beard trimmers and cosmetics.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even the state corrections department, an agency not known for its entrepreneurial spirit, has quietly supported Mr. Barrett’s efforts. Declining to comment specifically on Sendapackage, Tom Mailey, a department spokesman, said, “From our point of view, any vendor that is compliant with the rules and regulations and directives regarding packages will work for us.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On an ordinary day, Sendapackage handles up to 40 orders. About a third are placed online by relatives on the outside; most of the rest arrive from inside prisons by telephone or mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Barrett said the average order was usually in the neighborhood of $110. With seven employees, he currently serves all of New York’s 58 state prisons, and he would like to expand into neighboring Pennsylvania and into states like Texas and California, which have very large numbers of inmates.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. THE EVERYTHING STORE</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon By Brad Stone</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Illustrated. 372 pp. Little, Brown &amp; Company. $28.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">About a quarter of the way into “The Everything Store,” Brad Stone’s engrossing chronicle of the rise of Jeff Bezos and Amazon, he reveals that in the late 1990s, Bezos seriously contemplated trying to collect two copies of every book ever printed and store them in a warehouse in Lexington, Ky. Called the Alexandria Project, a k a Noah’s Ark, the initiative never got out of dry dock. And Lexington had no idea about its near miss with biblical importance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Project Fargo was even more ambitious: a proposal to fill a warehouse with one of every product ever manufactured. “This is the most critical project in Amazon’s history,” Bezos is said to have declared. It wasn’t, but it gives you a sense of the man’s penchant for grandiose ideas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These “fever dreams,” as employees called them, bring to mind Jorge Luis Borges’s sublime story “The Library of Babel,” in which the writer describes a “total” library — a huge stockpile of every possible arrangement of a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">25-symbol alphabet in 410-page books with 40-line pages and 80-letter lines. The idea is classic Borges, evoking a sense of the infinite despite the easily calculable (if still mind-numbingly large) number of books. Somewhere in there, his narrator observes, “there must exist a book that is the . . . compendium of all other books, and some librarian must have examined that book; this librarian is analogous to a god.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, Bezos is the god in Stone’s story, and definitely one of the vengeful and punishing sort, at least when it comes to those who have worked for him, those he has competed against and those who thought, mistakenly, they were in some sort of partnership with him. (That leaves his family, whom we’re told he loves dearly.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stone obviously admires his subject, but it’s hard to tell if he likes him. For that matter, it’s hard to tell if anybody likes him. Worth $27 billion, Bezos still makes employees pay for parking and for a time posted private ambulances outside warehouses during heat waves instead of ponying up for extra air-conditioners. It comes across loud and clear just how painful working anywhere near Bezos seems to have been over the years, despite halfhearted attempts by employees to recast a total lack of empathy as some sort of trick of leadership: one of his “gifts,” they say, is “to drive and motivate his employees without getting overly attached to them personally.” Is that a gift? It may be in actual war, but I’ll bet soldiers in the Middle East get more than free Gatorade and an extra 10 minutes of break time a day when the temperature tops 100 degrees.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s always lonely at the top, though, isn’t it? That’s where Bezos finds himself in 2013, less than 20 years into the building of a $140 billion company that has 200 million active customers. He has to be superhuman on some level, as the mere reading of his story makes you feel exhausted on his behalf. Even Zeus would have had trouble fighting so many simultaneous battles on so many fronts: against Wall Street naysayers, Barnes &amp; Noble, Wal-Mart, Apple, eBay, Google, the book publishing industry, Netflix, state-tax collectors and the like.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are those who draw nourishment from conflict, and Bezos does appear to revel in outwitting even his best partners. The publishing industry, for example, still doesn’t quite know how it willingly gave him the sword with which he would slice off its head. And Stone only hints at this one, but it’s a doozy: despite Amazon’s assurance</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to some manufacturers that it will reduce prices below suggested retail only to stay true to its lowest-price guarantee, “mysterious third-party sellers” tend to show up on the site with conveniently lower prices, which Amazon then matches with a “What else can we do?” shrug. What else? Here’s one suggestion: Confirm that those third-party suppliers are indeed what they claim they are and not, say, Amazon itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s amazing how much has happened at a company so young. First, Bezos pretty much proved the power of the “long tail.” Then he kick-started online affiliate marketing, paying other Web sites to send customers his way.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Next: 1-Click, which proved that the odds of our buying something online increase significantly when you save us five seconds. Are we really that impatient? Don’t ask Bezos, who might respond with one of his notorious (and, truth be told, often humorous) put-downs: “Does it surprise you that you don’t know the answer to that question?”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The list goes on: Amazon Marketplace, Amazon Prime, Kindle, Amazon Web Services, Amazon Instant Video. If that sounds like enough to monopolize one man’s attention, you’re wrong. Bezos also runs his own venture capital business and has been an early investor in Google, Twitter, Uber and Business Insider, among others.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then there’s his recent acquisition of a little journalistic outlet you might have heard of: The Washington Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of his achievements are awesomely complicated — like Amazon’s profitable effort to solve the “system of polynomial equations” that allows for the most efficient delivery of customer orders from one or more of the company’s dozens of fulfillment centers. But Stone’s long tenure covering both Bezos and Amazon (first at Newsweek, then at The New York Times and now at Bloomberg Businessweek) gives his retelling a sureness that keeps the story moving swiftly, even in passages where Amazon’s ever-present (and apparently intentional) internal chaos threatens to spill out onto the pages of the book itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stone does know when to provide a breather with entertaining anecdotes about Amazon’s competitive jujitsu. For instance: During the 1999 holiday season, the managers of Amazon’s fledgling toy division were worried they wouldn’t be able to meet surging demand for Pokémon toys. So they bought out the entire Pokémon inventory of the Toys “R” Us Web site, which shipped it to Amazon free. Amazon surely sold the toys at a loss. But guess who had happier customers that year?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos deserves his place in the pantheon of businessmen. Yet Stone also makes a great case for him as a replacement for Bill Gates as head of the Army of Geek Billionaires. This is a guy who has made decisions using a “regret-minimization framework” and whose love of “Star Trek” is such that he considered naming Amazon MakeItSo.com, a reference to one of Captain Picard’s signature lines. Even before he founded Blue Origin, a personal project aimed at enabling “private human access to space,” his high school girlfriend told reporters in the 1990s that “the reason he’s earning so much money is to get to outer space.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stone makes much of Bezos’ prescience, which no doubt seems to be more finely tuned than most people’s. Bezos long ago figured out the trick to a kind of experimentation Samsung uses against Apple in the smartphone wars. Whereas Apple finely calibrates its new product designs, Samsung makes one of every size, color and shape imaginable and sees which end up selling. Amazon does the same sort of thing. That’s not predicting the future, however, that’s placing a bet on every horse in the race. Still, you’ve got to give it to Bezos: It’s also the surest way to make sure you’re holding the winning ticket every time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, let’s not forget how many of Bezos’ competitors seem unable to predict the present, let alone the future. Publishers were shocked when he sandbagged them with $9.99 e-book pricing in 2007. Where had they been? Stone points out the paradox of a book about Bezos being published by one of the companies Amazon’s rise has threatened. But it’s all in keeping with the story of the “everything store,” which ultimately resembles an Escher drawing: these days, all retail roads do appear to begin and end with Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Duff McDonald’s latest book is “The Firm: The Story of McKinsey and Its Secret Influence on American Business.” Jeff Bezos, in 2009. | Michael Appleton for The New York Times</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020131101e9b3002pf</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_075.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark144">Bits Technology</a><a name="bookmark145">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Today’s Scuttlebot: Michael Arrington’s Conflicts, and Rewarding Amazon Reviewers</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">212 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">31 October 2013 NYT Blogs NYTB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was perhaps inevitable that Amazon would have a rocky relationship with book publishers. Publishers are analog, Amazon is digital. Publishers are New York, Amazon is Seattle. The large publishers traditionally did not know much about their customers, and did not really care. Amazon knew a lot about customers and made the most of it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As for smaller houses, they were among Amazon&#39;s most fervent early supporters. Amazon talked a lot in the beginning about leveling the playing field for small publishers. It did, but then things went south.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brad Stone&#39;s new book, &#39;&#39;The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,&#39;&#39; vividly documents just how troubled the Amazon/publisher relationship became by about 2004. The retailer&#39;s critics, who worry about a culture where Amazon has eliminated all gatekeepers except itself, will not be reassured by this book.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In negotiations with larger publishers, Mr. Stone writes, Amazon kept demanding more as it got bigger: steeper discounts, longer periods to pay and better shipping. Mr. Bezos, Amazon&#39;s chief executive, then turned up the heat on the most vulnerable publishers -- those most dependent on Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company&#39;s relationship with those publishers was called the Gazelle Project after Mr. Bezos said Amazon &#39;&#39;should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.&#39;&#39; A joke, perhaps, but such an aggressive one that Amazon&#39;s lawyers demanded the Gazelle Project be renamed the Small Publishers Negotiation Program.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Stone writes that Randy Miller, an Amazon executive in charge of a similar program in Europe, &#39;&#39;took an almost sadistic delight in pressuring book publishers to give Amazon more favorable financial terms.&#39;&#39; Mr. Miller would move their books to full price, take them off the recommendation engine or promote competing titles until he got better terms out of them, the book says.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I did everything I could to screw with their performance,&#39;&#39; Mr. Miller told the writer. The program was called Pay to Play until the Amazon lawyers changed it to Vendor Realignment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even some Amazon employees were literally sickened by how they had to behave, Mr. Stone writes. One book group employee said he had post-traumatic stress disorder for a year after quitting.

Mr. Kirshbaum declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Daphne Durham, the publisher for Amazon Publishing’s adult trade and children’s businesses, will take over Mr. Kirshbaum’s duties, Ms. Gelman said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Kirshbaum’s departure is the latest sign that Amazon’s publishing performance in New York has failed to meet the initial expectations. Traditional publishers worried at first about Amazon’s growing power, and news reports speculated about whether New York was “facing a full-scale invasion from Seattle.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Kirshbaum, whose background was in the more commercial side of publishing, was initially successful in signing some top authors, including Timothy Ferriss (“The Four-Hour Chef”), Penny Marshall (“My Mother Was Nuts”) and Billy Ray Cyrus (“Hillbilly Heart”).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But he was unable to persuade Barnes &amp; Noble, the nation’s largest bookstore chain, to sell Amazon’s books in its stores. Independent booksellers, who tend to see Amazon as a discount retailer that undercuts their business, almost uniformly refused to sell its books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That damaged Amazon’s ability to persuade authors and agents, who depend on print sales, to make deals with Amazon. Most book sales still come from print rather than digital.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Benjamin Anastas, whose book “Too Good to Be True” was published by Amazon in 2012, said that he knew the lack of brick-and-mortar sales would be a “stumbling block” from the beginning. But Amazon executives promised that their Web site was a major advantage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“They said what they could depend on and what other publishers couldn’t was that they have this incredible retail space, which is the Amazon online bookstore,” Mr. Anastas said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While he said he would consider publishing with Amazon again, he acknowledged that “it was frustrating not having the book in more bookstores.”</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2114&amp;m21978" class="s1" target="_blank">Shelf Awareness, an industry publication, </a><a href="http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2114&amp;m21978" class="a" target="_blank">first reported</a> <span style=" color: #000;">the news of Mr. Kirshbaum’s departure.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Kirshbaum, 69, began his career at Random House and eventually became the chairman and chief executive of the Time Warner Book Group.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon’s third quarter followed a familiar script: it sold vast quantities of things, lost money while doing so, and investors were delighted.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Revenue was $17.09 billion, up 24 percent and about $400 million more than predicted, the company said Thursday. But all that volume could not yield a profit. Amazon lost 9 cents a share, or $41 million, just like as had anticipated.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investors broke out the champagne. In after-hours trading, the stock was up $29, or 8 percent, to $361. The stock is up nearly tenfold since 2008.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is the subject of an increasingly bitter debate about whether all of its investing in warehouses and new ventures will ever lead to solid profits. The bulls think the company is building an unassailable position as the most important retailer in the country. The bears point to things like this week’s increase in the free shipping minimum to $35 from $25 as signs that Amazon must one day focus on the bottom line.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the moment, the bulls are very much in ascendance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon had predicted that revenue in the third quarter would rise 12 to 24 percent. The results came in at the very top of that range. As for the loss, it was smaller than the 60 cents a share, or $274 million, the company lost last year. Much of the poor 2012 showing was related to an ill-fated investment in LivingSocial, a daily deals site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a conference call with analysts, Tom Szkutak, Amazon’s chief financial officer, focused on what he called “a nice steady acceleration of growth” in North America since last year’s fourth quarter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Mr. Szkutak was chary with specifics. Asked about a reference in the results to signing up “millions” of new customers for the $79 Prime shipping service, he merely said, “Prime is growing very fast.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The results will nevertheless raise expectations for the fourth quarter. Amazon said sales might rise as little as 10 percent or as much as 25 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. And it warned it might once again lose money.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Amazon is the teacher’s pet of Wall Street,” said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research. “There is no other company in the entire world that has the consistently abominable rate of profitability they do and yet has the stratospheric valuation they do.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has about 100 fulfillment centers — what in the old economy were called warehouses. It has streamlined the process of opening these centers, but it is still a tremendous expense.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the last 90 days, the company said, it began using eight million square feet of new warehouses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is more to come. Amazon said this week that it would open new fulfillment centers in Hillsborough County and Lakeland, Fla., and in Baltimore.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/technology/sales-are-colossal-shares-are-soaring-all-amazoncom-is-missing-is-a-profit.html" class="a" target="_blank">Sales Are Colossal, Shares Are Soaring.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon.com tightened the requirements for one of its most popular shipping methods Tuesday morning.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The change is to Super Saver Shipping, which for a over a decade mailed items free as long as the order met a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$25 threshold.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new threshold: $35. Amazon gave no reason for the change.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Super Saver Shipping was in many ways Amazon&#39;s best deal for people who were occasional-to-regular shoppers but did not need emergency orders of diapers. Why buy something for $20 and pay a few dollars shipping if you could buy two things and get them mailed for free?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Super Saver Shipping began, it was an innovation. It helped spark the movement to cheap or free shipping by all online retailers, and cemented Amazon&#39;s reputation as a cutthroat competitor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here is the positive way to spin this announcement: This will tempt more customers to the Prime shipping service, which charges $79 a year for unlimited two-day delivery. It is thus a brilliant move by Amazon, which wants everyone to be Prime so they will buy more and more and keep raising revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here is the negative way: This is the biggest rollback of benefits for Amazon&#39;s customers ever. Amazon incessantly talks about how it is doing more for its customers; this goes in the other direction. Customers will notice.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;I would often order two CDs to get the free shipping, but now that isn&#39;t going to happen,&#39;&#39; said Ariel Grostern of Washington.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here is the really negative way: Amazon is under stress. Paulo Santos, a widely read short-seller on the Seeking Alpha financial site, published a post after the news with the headline, &#39;&#39;Amazon.com Shipping Change Means The Earnings Miss Is Probably Massive.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Santos quoted from Amazon&#39;s financial documents, where the company stresses, &#39;&#39;We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: justify;">&#39;&#39;What Amazon.com is doing is backtracking on this central tenet,&#39;&#39; Mr. Santos wrote. &#39;&#39;It would not do so lightly.&#39;&#39; The final spin: It will take more than this to dent investors&#39; optimism. Amazon shares rose after the news broke. An Amazon spokesman had no comment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: justify;">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All Rights Reserved. Nearly every day, Amazon announces a new venture.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It just bought an online education company and introduced a payment mechanism for Internet retailers that competes with PayPal. It started selling wine for the first time in New York, updated its line of tablets, gave the go-ahead to three new comedy pilots and began a design competition for its fashion division. It is setting up miniwarehouses inside suppliers like Procter &amp; Gamble to ship goods faster.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But one thing it will not be announcing this month: a significant profit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Who cares? Amazon lost money in 2012, and analysts are anticipating another loss when the company releases its third-quarter results on Thursday. Yet the stock is at a record high.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon shares are up about 150 percent since mid-2010, which perhaps not coincidentally was the last time the company had sizable profits. In other words, investors really decided they loved the company only when net income began to slide.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘This isn’t supposed to happen,’’ said William H. Janeway, an economist and venture capitalist. ‘‘It violates mainstream finance theory. Very few companies have been valued this way outside a systemic bubble.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No one is asserting that Amazon is a flat-out bubble, but there is an increasingly noisy debate about when it will</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">— or even whether it can — deliver the sort of bottom-line profit that investors normally demand from a company expected to post $75 billion in revenue this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some analysts point out that those sales are negligible when set against the market being targeted by Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive. ‘‘The market is effectively limitless: All of global consumer commerce and maybe business-to-business commerce as well,’’ said Mr. Janeway, author of ‘‘Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With that prize as the goal, making money today would be a positive hindrance. As Benedict Evans, an analyst in London, put it: ‘‘Bezos has chosen to run Amazon to be the biggest, most powerful and successful retailer on earth 20 years from now. Any fool could run it profitably today.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Others argue that once a discounter, always a discounter. Amazon is branching out into many forms of commerce and technology, but at its core it sells commodity goods cheaply. A book from Amazon is the same book that it would be from any other retailer, and so is a package of diapers. Amazon also ships cheaply and has renowned customer service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To make a significant profit, though, some or all of those variables will have to change, and that might alienate customers and slow down that roaring revenue growth. That, in turn, would cause investors to demand a profit sooner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Best not to venture down that road, said Colin Gillis, senior technology analyst at BGC Partners. ‘‘It is easier,’’ he said, ‘‘to sell things and not make money than it is to sell things and make money.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this view, Amazon’s whirlwind of activity — a set-top box, thrusting it into more direct competition with Netflix, is expected to be announced any day, while the rumors of an Amazon smartphone will not cease — is merely a useful distraction from its retailing reality.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The premise that Amazon can change its business model from selling other people’s products at a razor-thin profit margin to selling other people’s products at a large margin ‘‘is not credible,’’ wrote Horace Dediu, an analyst with Asymco.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Companies simply do not shift their business model so simply, he added, noting that Microsoft, for all its money and expertise, still could not reorient its PC-based strategy to take advantage of the trend to mobile computing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The current discussion about Amazon is reminiscent of the arguments about the company during the last systemic bubble, in 1999. Then, too, the corporate goal was to get big fast, to seize new markets before anyone else.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But when the crash came, all the talk of unlimited potential disappeared. It was replaced by a fierce concentration on profit, which was described as being right around the corner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Bezos said in 2001 that the retailer would ‘‘ferociously manage the products we carry so that we sell only products that are profitable. The 30-pound box of nails isn’t long for our world.’’ Investors were mollified and the company survived.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That was then. You can once again buy a box of 4,000 nails on Amazon (shipping weight: 38 pounds, or 17 kilograms) and have them delivered to your door free. But the retailer has gone far beyond such modest offers. The Thunderbird Cookie Dropping Machine costs $32,329 and weighs half a ton, but Amazon will also ship it free. (It is currently out of stock.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commercial Food Services Equipment, a third-party vendor in Chicago, lists a Thunderbird for sale on Amazon, but charges almost $2,600 for shipping.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Amazon will sell many more cookie dropping machines than I will, but even if you buy from me instead of Amazon, it will earn a commission on the sale and the shipping,’’ said Hyo Lee, the owner of Commercial Food. ‘‘Now you know why Amazon’s sales have gone from $34 billion in 2010 to $61 billion in 2012.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, she noted that Amazon was building dozens of warehouses around the United States and hiring tens of thousands of employees for them. ‘‘It has all these fixed costs now,’’ she said. ‘‘I think they’ll have to start charging more for shipping.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Others agree that nothing grows to the sky forever.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">‘‘At some point, the piper must be paid,’’ said George Colony, the chief executive of Forrester Research. How? ‘‘By raising prices. I don’t see any other way.’’</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the edges, Amazon has started doing that, reining in a bit of its largess to the annoyance of some of its customers. For example, customers who paid $79 a year to join its Prime two-day shipping service used to be able to get really urgent things delivered the next day for an additional $3.99 an item.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon customer named Perry Denton took full advantage of this when he bought a lawn mower. His Prime overnight fee was $3.99, Mr. Denton wrote in an Amazon forum. ‘‘I kind of felt guilty, but I really needed a mower.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last summer, devoted Prime users discovered that the company had started charging variable amounts according to size and weight, with a minimum of $2.99. A self-propelled Lawn Boy mower, for instance, is now</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$25 overnight.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is still a good deal, perhaps, but not as good as $3.99. The forum was full of complaints about how Prime customers were, as one of them put it, ‘‘receiving less service for the same money.’’ Some who commented also wondered why there had been no announcement that the company was changing its shipping policies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman confirmed the change but said the company kept adding entertainment extras to Prime without raising the membership fee, including 41,000 movies and TV shows. Those three pilots it approved early this month, for instance, will be shown free to Prime customers. Amazon is reportedly losing as much as $1 billion a year on its streaming video service.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Josh McFarland, chief executive of TellApart, a start-up that helps retailers manage their data, bought a $20 pair of flip-flops from Amazon. Then he found a pair he liked even more elsewhere, and prepared to return the Amazon set. The company told him not to bother. It would give him a refund anyway.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Few retailers feel they can afford to be so generous, but other Amazon shoppers have recently reported the same experience. It is a game for the long term; will customers remember next year what you did for them today?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘What Amazon is trying to do is raise my expectations so that I’ll eventually buy everything from it,’’ Mr. McFarland said. ‘‘At some point it won’t have any more competition, and I won’t know if prices are being raised because I’ll have nothing to compare it to.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020131022e9an0008s</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_083.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark160">finance</a><a name="bookmark161">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In switch, Walmart apes Amazon; Both retail giants’ moves suggest stores and online are equally vital to them</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER and STEPHANIE CLIFFORD</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,333 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">22 October 2013 International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. CORRECTION APPENDED</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A plucky Silicon Valley company, having to compete for talented engineers, is trying it all: recruiting billboards on Highway 101, workplace perks like treadmill workstations and foosball tables, and conference rooms named after celebrities like Rihanna and Justin Bieber.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">The name of that arriviste company? Walmart.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The largest U.S. retailer, which for years did not blink at would-be competitors, is now under such a threat from Amazon that it is frantically playing catch-up by learning the technology business, including starting @WalmartLabs, its dot-com headquarters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The two retail behemoths, one the king of the physical store and the other the conqueror of the online world, are battling over e-commerce — competing for the most talented engineers, trying to gain the upper hand in the new frontier of same-day delivery and warring over online pricing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They want to control not just Internet shopping but all shopping. Even as Walmart pours money into technology, Amazon is building a physical presence across the nation, adding warehouses and pickup locations. Both companies’ moves indicate that they believe the future of commerce is not just stores and not just online but a combination of the two.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the first time in decades, Walmart, which drove company after company out of business, has a competitor it sounds a little scared of.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Don’t think for a second that Jeff Bezos is not a capitalist,’’ Neil M. Ashe, chief executive of Walmart Global</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">E-Commerce, said of the belief of Mr. Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, in low prices and paper-thin margins. ‘‘They’re just playing a game, which is, ‘We’re just going to wait out the world.’’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although the fierce competition between Walmart and Amazon is occurring in all areas, to get the technological edge Walmart has to succeed in San Bruno.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has had a small presence near Silicon Valley for more than a decade, but until recently, engineers in the area barely knew it existed. It signed a lease three years ago for the San Bruno office, north of the valley — and across the street from YouTube — and is opening another this fall in Sunnyvale, home of Yahoo. It is trying hard to prove it is one of the cool kids.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For example, at press events in Bentonville, Arkansas, Walmart’s headquarters, the menu tends to be ham sandwiches, chips and iced tea. At a recent event in San Bruno, it was white asparagus panna cotta with house-smoked salmon tartar and charcuterie from a whole pig. Borrowing a page from Google and Twitter, the company offers hack days when engineers can work on whatever they want.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The changes are more than cosmetic, though. This year, @WalmartLabs has gone on a start-up shopping spree, buying four companies — Torbit, OneOps, Tasty Labs and Inkiru — that build things like tools to crunch data and speed up Web sites. The acquisitions included some of the start-ups’ founders and engineers, the time-honored way for Silicon Valley companies to hire the talented employees they need to build better Web and mobile tools.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart has hundreds of open jobs at its office in San Bruno. This summer, the company hired 150 people from companies like Yahoo and eBay.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company’s pitch to engineers is that Walmart moves quickly and has huge problems to solve, even if it is not a nimble newcomer or a buzzworthy start-up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘There’s big data and there’s Walmart big data,’’ said Ravi Raj, vice president for mobile and social products at @WalmartLabs. ‘‘Every week, we release half a dozen features.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rick Devine, chief executive of TalentSky, a Silicon Valley recruiting firm that has recruited for the company before, said Walmart’s scale was attractive to young engineers. Still, he said, the competition is fierce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘The kind of people they’re going to be looking for — big data and e-commerce type of people — those are the same kinds of people Silicon Valley cares about,’’ he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which is based in Seattle, also has a Silicon Valley presence; its Lab126 research company, located not far from Apple’s headquarters, developed the Kindle and is working on other mobile devices. Amazon is a much bigger player online, with $74.4 billion in revenue expected for 2013. While Walmart’s total revenue is close to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$500 billion, it has said it expects just a fraction of that, $10 billion, in e-commerce revenue for the year ending in January.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart.com had 62.5 million unique visitors in August, compared with Amazon’s 133 million, according to Compete, which tracks Web use.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Amazon is the Walmart of the post-2000 period,’’ said Matt Nemer, an analyst at Wells Fargo.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart was slow to embrace online shopping, keeping its Web operations separate and haltingly adopting new technology. These days, though, it is trying to turn its 4,100 stores in the United States and many of its 6,200 stores overseas into e-commerce assets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two-thirds of the U.S. population is within five miles, or eight kilometers, of a Walmart, according to the company, and more than 10 percent of items ordered online are shipped from stores. Countries in which it has a physical presence for e-commerce include Brazil, China and Britain.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is also allowing customers to pick up online orders in stores or, in a test in Washington, in lockers. It is trying same-day delivery in five markets, and grocery delivery in the San Francisco Bay Area and Denver.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Executives say Walmart wants to become almost as fast as Amazon, but for people who cannot afford the $79 fee of Amazon’s Prime service, with its free two-day shipping.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has been building warehouses throughout the United States as it tries to expedite its shipping and conquer online grocery delivery. It has had lockers at stores like 7-Eleven for about a year, though in September, RadioShack and Staples stopped participating in the program. Abroad, Amazon has moved even faster with services like same-day delivery and groceries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Following Amazon, Walmart has revamped its online and mobile technology. It has software to watch social media like Pinterest for popular products and to monitor online prices and lower them accordingly or alert merchants.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And it has created a mobile app that flips into in-store mode when customers enter a store and guides them to the milk or celery and offers digital coupons; customers can scan items as they shop for quick self-checkout.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts say that while Walmart’s scale and profitability give it an edge, its Web efforts still lag behind Amazon’s. The grocery delivery test, for instance, has gone on for two years without expansion. Mr. Nemer of Wells Fargo called many of the efforts, like lockers and same-day shipping, ‘‘blocking and tackling’’ without real relevance to Walmart’s dominance, or inferiority, in the new world of shopping.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ashe of Walmart said of those efforts, ‘‘The question is whether people want them.’’ Echoing Facebook’s motto on risk taking, ‘‘fail harder,’’ he said: ‘‘We fully expect, and want, to shut things down.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And, he said, the culture clash between Bentonville and San Bruno has not been as great as one might expect.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘We are of Walmart and Silicon Valley at the same time,’’ he said. ‘‘So we have a great cafeteria, but we don’t pay for all your food.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CORRECTION:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As published in the International New York Times</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An article on Oct. 22 about Walmart’s efforts to catch up in online technology misstated the name of the company’s e-commerce division.

But one thing it will not announce this month, </a>David Streitfeld reports<span class="p">, is a significant profit.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Who cares? Amazon lost money in 2012, and analysts are anticipating another loss when the company releases its third-quarter results on Thursday. Yet the stock is at a record high.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon shares are up around 150 percent since mid-2010, which perhaps not coincidentally was the last time the company had sizable profits. In other words, investors really decided they loved the company only when net income began to slide.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“This isn’t supposed to happen,” said William H. Janeway, an economist and venture capitalist. “It violates mainstream finance theory. Very few companies have been valued this way outside a systemic bubble.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No one is asserting that Amazon is a flat-out bubble, but there is an increasingly noisy debate about when it will</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">— or even whether it can — deliver the sort of bottom-line profits that investors normally demand from a company expected to post $75 billion in revenue this year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some analysts point out that those sales are negligible when set against the market being targeted by Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive. “The market is effectively limitless: all of global consumer commerce and maybe business-to-business commerce as well,” said Mr. Janeway, author of “Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With that prize as the goal, making money today would be a positive hindrance. As Benedict Evans, an analyst based in London, put it: “Bezos has chosen to run Amazon to be the biggest, most powerful and successful retailer on Earth 20 years from now. Any fool could run it profitably today.”</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/a-new-book-portrays-amazon-as-bully/" class="a" target="_blank">A New Book Portrays Amazon as </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/a-new-book-portrays-amazon-as-bully/" target="_blank">Bully</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/jeff-bezos-a-brief-anthology/" class="a" target="_blank">Jeff Bezos: A Brief </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/jeff-bezos-a-brief-anthology/" target="_blank">Anthology</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/the-tech-sectors-mixed-response-to-bezoss-purchase-of-the-post/" class="a" target="_blank">Tech Sector Responds to Bezos Deal for The </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/the-tech-sectors-mixed-response-to-bezoss-purchase-of-the-post/" target="_blank">Post</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/daily-report-tech-mogul-in-deal-for-a-landmark-in-the-capital/" class="a" target="_blank">Daily Report: Tech Mogul in Deal for a Landmark in the </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/daily-report-tech-mogul-in-deal-for-a-landmark-in-the-capital/" target="_blank">Capital</a></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Daily Report: Google Exceeds Earnings Estimates as Ad Prices Slip<span class="p"> Document NYTB000020131022e9am0018h</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_085.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark164">B</a><a name="bookmark165">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">SALES ARE COLOSSAL, SHARES ARE SOARING.

CHEN</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">985 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">22 October 2013 International New York Times INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. The race for the tablet market has become a full-blown sprint.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The intense competition will be highlighted on Tuesday, as Apple, Nokia and Microsoft each introduce new tablets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those devices will be competing for consumer attention against several others recently released by other tech heavyweights, including Amazon, Google and Samsung Electronics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The stakes are high, and getting higher, as demand for tablets has exploded in the past few years. According to Gartner, a market research company, about 120 million tablets were shipped in 2012, nearly seven times as many as in 2010, when the Apple iPad was first released and generated wide interest.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Getting on an airplane it’s amazing the number of iPads that you now see that used to be either notebooks or portable DVD players,’’ along with smaller tablets and e-book readers that are replacing books and magazines, said Ross Rubin, an independent analyst for Reticle Research.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple has maintained a clear lead, but with the tablet offerings from manufacturers almost as abundant as those for smartphones, the market has become more fractured.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the second quarter, iPads had the largest share of the worldwide tablet market, with 32 percent, according to the research firm IDC. Samsung, the No. 2 tablet maker, is quickly gaining traction, with 18 percent of the market in the second quarter, up from 7.6 percent in the period a year earlier.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple is expected to announce significantly upgraded versions of its iPad and iPad Mini devices on Tuesday. The iPad Mini is expected to have a higher-resolution display, while the bigger iPad is expected to have a slimmer design, weighing about a pound. Both iPads will also most likely get Apple’s new processors, but not the fingerprint sensor that is in the latest high-end iPhone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the same day, Microsoft will release new versions of its Surface tablets, and Nokia, the mobile device maker Microsoft is in the process of buying much of, is expected to introduce a new tablet in Abu Dhabi.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Rubin said each manufacturer had developed slightly different approaches with tablets. Microsoft, for example, is largely going after professionals by offering tablets that double as PCs. Samsung sells a large variety of tablets, some that include a stylus for drawing and taking notes, to cater to different professions and interests. And Apple markets its iPads as versatile devices that can be used for both work and play.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon offers low-priced tablets to get people to buy content from its stores — one of several less expensive tablets that have emerged to challenge the iPad. Amazon’s Kindle Fire costs as little as $140, and Google’s Nexus tablet starts at $230. Apple’s iPad Mini starts at $330.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many new tablets have already failed or struggled. Hewlett-Packard’s TouchPad tablet was killed after 48 days of slow sales. BlackBerry’s PlayBook was a dismal failure. And Microsoft’s first Surface tablets, released last year, sold so poorly that the company took a $900 million write-down for unsold inventory.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of the tablets may not be catching on because people are not finding them very useful. A Gartner survey found that 80 percent of people with iPads use their tablets at least 10 times a day, much more often than people</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with other kinds of tablets. That gives iPad owners more time to be exposed to buying more apps, movies and games. And the more apps they buy, the more likely they will keep buying Apple hardware in the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Other tablet providers need to understand why owners of their tablets spent significantly less time on their devices,’’ said Annette Jump, a research director at Gartner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite the difficulties of breaking into the market, device makers push hard, knowing that future profits could depend in large part on tablet sales.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is especially true for companies like Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, which have traditionally been closely tied to the PC market. Sales of PCs have softened considerably in recent years, and one reason is that consumers have turned to more mobile tablets for basic computing tasks, like Web surfing and casual game playing. That trend is expected to accelerate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gartner predicts tablets will outship PCs on an annual basis in two years. About 184 million tablets will be shipped in 2013, Gartner says, versus 303 million PCs. But by 2015, manufacturers will ship 331 million tablets and 272 million PCs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, remarked on the rapid growth of the iPad in an earnings call last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘Just two years after we shipped the initial iPad, we sold 67 million,’’ Mr. Cook said. ‘‘It took us 24 years to sell that many Macs, and five years for that many iPods, and over three years for that many iPhones.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For now, at least, Apple continues to be the standard to beat.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘It’s the reference point,’’ said Mr. Rubin of Reticle Research. ‘‘It was a pioneer in making tablets more popular and more accessible.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even Apple, though, faces challenges, particularly in emerging markets. In China, for example, generic unbranded tablets that are occasionally fakes sell for as little as $80 and are extremely popular. Yet there is a bright side for Apple in China: The Chinese are buying either the cheap white-box tablets or an iPad, not much in between, according to Carolina Milanesi, a research vice president at Gartner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In such a fast-changing market, however, that could quickly change. What appears certain is that consumers will be hearing much more about tablets this fall, and particularly this week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘‘A new iPad launch always piques consumer interest in the tablet category,’’ Tom Mainelli, a research director at IDC, said in a statement. ‘‘And traditionally that has helped both Apple and its competitors.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document INHT000020131022e9am0000a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_087.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark168">The Media Equation</a><a name="bookmark169">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Business Day; Media &amp; Advertising</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Tech Wealth and Ideas Are Heading Into News</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By DAVID CARR</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,361 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">21 October 2013 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Producing serious news is an expensive enterprise with a beleaguered business model, one that remains tied to the tracks as a locomotive of splintered audiences and declining advertising hurtles toward it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But just when it looked as if all were lost, an unlikely cavalry has come roaring over the hill with serious money, fresh ideas and no small amount of enthusiasm. Silicon Valley and its various power brokers — some who had roles in putting the news business in harm’s way to begin with — are suddenly investing significant sums of money in preserving news capacity and quality.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/business/media/snowden-journalists-new-venture-to-be-bankrolled-by-ebay-founder.html" class="s1" target="_blank">Pierre M. Omidyar, the founder of eBay, revealed last week that he </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/business/media/snowden-journalists-new-venture-to-be-bankrolled-by-ebay-founder.html" class="a" target="_blank">would back</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/business/media/amazoncom-founder-to-buy-the-washington-post.html" class="s1" target="_blank">the journalist Glenn Greenwald and his colleagues in a newly conceived news site to the tune of $250 million. Just over two months ago, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, spent </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/business/media/amazoncom-founder-to-buy-the-washington-post.html" class="a" target="_blank">the same amount</a> <span style=" color: #000;">to personally buy The Washington Post. That’s half a billion dollars dropped into serious news production, a sector that investors in distressed assets have been fleeing.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It doesn’t stop there. In July, Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Steve Jobs, invested in Ozy Media, a news start-up, joining a group that includes the angel investor Ron Conway; Larry Sonsini, a lawyer from an eminent Silicon Valley law firm; Dan Rosensweig of Chegg.com; and David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chris Hughes used his Facebook money to buy The New Republic and provide financial support to Upworthy, an aggregator of quality material. Next-generation news companies including Vice, Vox Media, BuzzFeed and Business Insider have all recently received significant investment. (In addition, Jeff Skoll, another eBay alum, backed Participant Media and now the TV channel Pivot, to make “socially relevant” films and television.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The list goes on, but the trend is clear: quality news has become, if not sexy, suddenly attractive to smart digital money. It makes sense once you step back. For all its excesses, Silicon Valley has not been a place where ostentation creates social capital. While any tech reporter will tell you that the valley is far from media-friendly, the people in leadership there are close, ferocious consumers of news and have strong opinions about its current shortcomings. And it would be a mistake to view the recent moves by some of the most important people in technology as a lark.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Technologists have a view, perhaps inflated, that they can make the world better,” Mr. Omidyar said in an interview over the weekend. “There may be limits to doing it only through technology, or perhaps you get tired of doing it only through technology. So getting into content and broad communication is appealing.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It would also be a mistake to believe that the only thing digitally enriched players bring is money. The investment of intellectual capital will be just as important. If ever an industry was in need of innovation — of big ideas from uncommon thinkers — it is the news business.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/media/index.html" class="s1" target="_blank">“I think that technology could help find a way to actually do important journalism for our democracy that can impact many more people and help serve it to a general-interest audience in a way that can be commercially sustainable,” Mr. Omidyar said. (More excerpts from the interview with Mr. Omidyar are at </a>www.nytimes.com/pages/business/media/index.html<span class="p">).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smaller companies have created news sites that point a way forward but cannot begin to fill the loss of journalistic capacity that accompanied the great shakeout in the industry. For a time, it seemed as if newspapers, where much of journalism’s horsepower is stored, would either be strip-mined or become a plaything.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“People have been speculating that newspapers would become nothing more than trophies for rich businesspeople at the end of their careers,” said Michael Zimbalist, vice president for research and development at The New York Times. “But now successful midcareer entrepreneurs are investing and willing to play the long game. They have been disrupters themselves and won’t be bringing the same assumptions to the table.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A profound reset is under way. In more than a decade of covering the news end of the media business, I cannot think of a time of greater optimism or potential. Nontraditional operators like Mr. Bezos can afford to adopt a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">long-term strategy, something he has done rather effectively at Amazon. And the barriers to entry for ventures like Mr. Omidyar’s start-up have evaporated: cheap digital tools enable production and collaboration, while social media like Twitter and Facebook enable the spread of content through sharing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Technology and journalism, former antagonists, are about to give bromance a try, with Mr. Bezos and Mr. Omidyar leading the way.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both men have upended and reinvented entire legacy categories. EBay created a community out of private buyers and sellers, while Amazon found gold among stacks of books with a seemingly infinite catalog, one-click buying and later, all manner of consumer goods. (Amazon also knows a little about last-mile delivery, so plopping a newspaper on the doorstep never had it so good.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kenneth Lerer, who is a partner at Lerer Ventures and has backed online sites like BuzzFeed and The Huffington Post, says Mr. Omidyar’s enterprise, which does not even have a name yet, has a leg up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The freedom to start a digital concern without legacy baggage is an enormous opportunity, much easier than trying to pivot a traditional news organization,” he said, adding that in both instances digital innovation would be in the front seat. “You cannot launch a successful modern media company without technology as an equal partner.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It does not take an M.B.A. to understand that the ability to capture consumers’ attention and move them around a platform, all the while extracting value, might come in handy in the media business. ITunes used cheap, uniformly priced content to animate the sales of devices like the iPod; Amazon used cheap devices like the Kindle to push lucrative content sales. EBay reduced the friction and suspicion between buyers and sellers of all kinds of goods.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reverse-engineering those skills into the production of news could have a big impact, as publishing companies turn toward consumers for revenue, pivoting from passive delivery of news to a deeper relationship with customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The willingness to answer bedeviling old questions in new ways does not ensure success, but it creates remarkable possibilities. “Both Jeff Bezos and Pierre Omidyar have a hacker’s ethos, a willingness to engage in lateral thinking to solve problems in a nonconventional way, to reject what has been taken for granted and MacGyver their way to solutions,” suggested Shane Snow, a founder of Contently, a marketplace for content creators.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consider Amazon’s ability to lead consumers through a highly personalized array of choices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“If you have a story that is read by a million people, that’s great, but how do you get those million people to read another story?” said Henry Blodget of Business Insider. “Amazon is extraordinary at customizing its site for every visitor. They do endless testing and understand stickiness and relevance in a way few media companies do.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the secrets of Amazon (and Netflix) is that it never offered one site, but millions of customized sites. It is not hard to envision a carefully measured invitation at the bottom of a highly trafficked news article: “People who read this story are also reading ...”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This unfolding partnership will be fun to behold. For all their differences, the news and technology businesses share a kind of utopianism, an idealistic belief that the work of human hands can make life better for other humans.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter: @carr2n</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, bought The Washington Post. | Matthew Ryan Williams for The New York Times | Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Steve Jobs, invested in Ozy Media, a news start-up. | Gus Ruelas/Reuters | Pierre M.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SAN BRUNO, Calif. -- A plucky Silicon Valley company, forced to compete for talented engineers, is trying it all -- recruiting billboards on Highway 101; workplace perks like treadmill workstations and foosball tables; and conference rooms named after celebrities like Rihanna and Justin Bieber.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">The name of that arriviste company? Walmart.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The country&#39;s largest retailer, which for years didn&#39;t blink at would-be competitors, is now under such a threat from Amazon that it is frantically playing catch-up by learning the technology business, including starting @WalmartLabs at Walmart Global E-Commerce, its dot-com division.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The two retail behemoths, one the king of the physical store and the other the conqueror of the online world, are battling over e-commerce -- competing for the most talented engineers, trying to gain the upper hand in the new frontier of same-day delivery and warring over online pricing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They want to control not just Internet shopping but all shopping. Even as Walmart pours money into technology, Amazon is building a physical presence across the nation, adding warehouses and pickup locations. Both companies&#39; moves indicate that they believe the future of commerce is not just stores and not just online but a combination of the two.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For the first time in decades, Walmart, which drove company after company out of business, has a competitor it sounds a little scared of.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Don&#39;t think for a second that Jeff Bezos is not a capitalist,&#39;&#39; Neil M. Ashe, chief executive of Walmart Global</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">E-Commerce, said of the belief of Mr. Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, in low prices and paper-thin margins. &#39;&#39;They&#39;re just playing a game, which is, &#39;We&#39;re just going to wait out the world.&#39; &#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although the fierce competition between Walmart and Amazon is occurring in all areas, to get the technological edge Walmart has to succeed in San Bruno.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The company has had a small presence near Silicon Valley for more than a decade, but until recently, engineers in the area barely knew it existed. It signed a lease three years ago for the San Bruno office, north of the valley -- and across the street from YouTube -- and is opening another this fall in Sunnyvale, home of Yahoo, in the heart of the valley. It is trying hard to prove it is one of the cool kids.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For example, at press events in Bentonville, Ark., Walmart&#39;s headquarters, the menu tends to be ham sandwiches, chips and iced tea. At a recent event in San Bruno, it was white asparagus panna cotta with house-smoked salmon tartar, morel mushroom macaroons and charcuterie from a whole pig. Borrowing a page from Google and Twitter, the company offers hack days when engineers can work on whatever they want.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The changes are more than cosmetic, though. This year, @WalmartLabs has gone on a start-up shopping spree, buying four companies -- Torbit, OneOps, Tasty Labs and Inkiru -- that build things like tools to crunch data and</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">speed up Web sites. The acquisitions included some of the start-ups&#39; founders and engineers, the time-honored way for Silicon Valley companies to hire the talented employees they need to build better Web and mobile tools.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart has hundreds of open jobs at its office here. This summer, the company hired 150 people from companies like Yahoo and eBay.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company&#39;s pitch to engineers is that Walmart moves quickly and has huge problems to solve, even if it is not a nimble newcomer or a buzzworthy start-up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;There&#39;s big data and there&#39;s Walmart big data,&#39;&#39; said Ravi Raj, vice president for mobile and social products at @WalmartLabs. &#39;&#39;Every week we release half a dozen features.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rick Devine, chief executive of TalentSky, a Silicon Valley recruiting firm that has recruited for the company before, said Walmart&#39;s scale was attractive to young engineers. Still, he said, the competition is fierce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;The kind of people they&#39;re going to be looking for -- big data and e-commerce type of people -- those are the same kinds of people Silicon Valley cares about,&#39;&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, which is based in Seattle, also has a Silicon Valley presence; its Lab126 research company, located a few miles from Apple&#39;s headquarters, developed the Kindle and is working on other mobile devices. Amazon is a much bigger player online, with $74.4 billion in revenue expected for 2013. While Walmart&#39;s total revenue is close to $500 billion, it has said it expects just a fraction of that, $10 billion, in e-commerce revenue for the year ending January 2014.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart.com had 62.5 million unique visitors in August, compared with Amazon&#39;s 133 million, according to Compete, which tracks Web use.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Amazon is the Walmart of the post-2000 period,&#39;&#39; said Matt Nemer, an analyst at Wells Fargo.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walmart was slow to embrace online shopping, keeping its Web operations separate and haltingly adopting new technology. These days, though, it is trying to turn its 4,100 stores in the United States and many of its 6,200 stores overseas into e-commerce assets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two-thirds of the United States population is within five miles of a Walmart, according to the company, and more than 10 percent of items ordered online are shipped from stores. Countries in which it has a physical presence for e-commerce include Brazil, China and Britain.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is also allowing customers to pick up online orders in stores or, in a test in Washington, in lockers. It is trying same-day delivery in five markets, and grocery delivery in the Bay Area and Denver.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Executives say Walmart wants to become almost as fast as Amazon, but for people who can&#39;t afford the $79 fee of Amazon&#39;s Prime service, with its free two-day shipping.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has been building warehouses throughout the United States as it tries to expedite its shipping and conquer online grocery delivery. It has had lockers at stores like 7-Eleven for about a year, though in September, RadioShack and Staples stopped participating in the program. Abroad, Amazon has moved even faster with services like same-day delivery and groceries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Following Amazon, Walmart has revamped its online and mobile technology. It has software to watch social media like Pinterest for popular products and to monitor online prices and lower them accordingly or alert merchants.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And it has created a mobile app that flips into in-store mode when customers enter a store and guides them to the milk or celery and offers digital coupons; customers can scan items as they shop for quick self-checkout.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts say that while Walmart&#39;s scale and profitability give it an edge, its Web efforts still lag Amazon&#39;s. The grocery delivery test, for instance, has gone on for two years without expansion. Mr. Nemer of Wells Fargo called many of the efforts, like lockers and same-day shipping, &#39;&#39;blocking and tackling&#39;&#39; without real relevance to Walmart&#39;s dominance, or inferiority, in the new world of shopping.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr. Ashe of Walmart said of those efforts, &#39;&#39;The question is whether people want them.&#39;&#39; Echoing Facebook&#39;s motto on risk taking, &#39;&#39;fail harder,&#39;&#39; he said: &#39;&#39;We fully expect, and want, to shut things down.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And, he said, the culture clash between Bentonville and San Bruno has not been as great as one might expect.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;We are of Walmart and Silicon Valley at the same time,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;So we have a great cafeteria, but we don&#39;t pay for all your food.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Neil M.

Mr. Ruh said that one product, designed to maximize a jet’s fuel burn while monitoring carbon emissions, would save an airline $90 million over five years. A power generation product designed to optimize turbine usage was expected to increase one utility’s profits by $28 million, while creating lower emissions per megawatt.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The push into the Industrial Internet is likely to have profound changes for G.E. as well. Mr. Ruh, who heads a 300-person Bay Area office, said G.E. is adopting practices like releasing stripped-down products quickly, monitoring usage and rapidly changing designs depending on how things are used by customers. These approaches follow the “lean start-up” style at many software-intensive Internet companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We’re getting these offerings done in three, six, nine months,” he said. “It used to take three years.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mark Little, G.E.’s chief technology officer, has also said that the Industrial Internet could revive G.E.’s manufacturing business in the United States, though not in ways traditional manufacturers would recognize. Since</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">G.E. wants to understand how machines behave in the field, it also needs to have its sensors on them from the earliest part of their creation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“We’ve spent most of my career trying to offload manufacturing,” Mr. Little said in an interview in June. “Now we’re talking about vertical integration again.” Much of the manufacturing, however, will be done by robots, he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">G.E. may be anticipating some criticism if it does move factories from China to the United States but doesn’t put many humans in them. On Tuesday, the company published<a href="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GE_IndustrialInternetatWork.pdf" class="s3" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GE_IndustrialInternetatWork.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">a paper</a> saying that massive automation of factories</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">would not mean a net job loss. Instead, it said, workers would be retrained to be more productive by interacting with the machines. It was not clear how or why this retraining, or the expansion of United States manufacturing using robots, would require nearly the same number of workers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“No one is talking about a refreshing of the tradition of manufacturing onshore,” Mr. Ruh said. “The scope and kinds of jobs will change, and they will require lots more math and science skills.”</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/the-cloud-era-begins-for-enterprise-tech/" class="a" target="_blank">The Cloud Era Begins for Enterprise </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/the-cloud-era-begins-for-enterprise-tech/" target="_blank">Tech</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/daily-report-as-tech-industry-shifts-big-players-scramble-to-adapt/" class="a" target="_blank">Daily Report: As Tech Industry Shifts, Big Players Scramble to </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/daily-report-as-tech-industry-shifts-big-players-scramble-to-adapt/" target="_blank">Adapt</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/general-electric-adds-to-its-industrial-internet/" class="a" target="_blank">General Electric Adds to Its ‘Industrial </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/general-electric-adds-to-its-industrial-internet/" target="_blank">Internet’</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/idc-predicts-an-apple-ipad-and-battles-in-the-cloud/" class="a" target="_blank">For 2010, IDC Predicts an Apple iPad and Battles in the </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/idc-predicts-an-apple-ipad-and-battles-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank">Cloud</a></p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/daily-report-europe-weighs-regulations-for-cloud-computing/" class="a" target="_blank">Daily Report: Europe Weighs Regulations for Cloud </a><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/daily-report-europe-weighs-regulations-for-cloud-computing/" target="_blank">Computing</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eric Anderson, an engineer at a turbine factory run by General Electric, which has been one of the biggest promoters of the so-called Industrial Internet. | Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times | Eric Anderson, an engineer at a turbine factory run by General Electric, which has been one of the biggest promoters of the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">so-called Industrial Internet. | Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times Document NYTB000020131009e9a9001jl</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="270" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_093.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark180">Business Day</a><a name="bookmark181">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">France Takes Aim at Amazon to Protect Local Bookshops</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By REUTERS</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">427 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 October 2013 NYTimes.com Feed NYTFEED</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARIS — French lawmakers on Thursday took aim at Amazon to protect local bookshops by voting through a law that bars online booksellers from offering free delivery to customers on top of a maximum 5 percent discount on books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The law is part of France’s broader regulation of book prices and curbs on discounting, which was passed in 1981 by the Socialist government at the time to protect small bookshops from supermarket chains.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the past decade, online outlets have challenged physical bookstores, prompting French publishers to lobby for a change in the law to stop what they call Amazon’s “dumping” and “unfair competition”.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to a French parliamentary report, online book sales rose to 13.1 percent of total book sales in 2011 from 3.2 percent in 2003. The country is still home to more bookstores than most countries with 2,000-2,500 in a country of 65 million people, compared with 1,000 in Britain, which has roughly the same-sized population.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The (book pricing) law is part of our cultural heritage,” said conservative lawmaker Christian Kert who sponsored the bill.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">France’s lower chamber, with the support of the Socialist government, passed the law unanimously. It will now go to the Senate, which is expected to pass it by the end of the year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For its part, Amazon said the law would have the perverse effect of hurting sales of books from the back catalogue and from smaller publishing houses, which were often bought online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“All measures that aim to raise the price of books sold online will curb the ability of French people to buy cultural works and discriminates against those who buy online,” it said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The proposed law is only the latest example of France taking aim at U.S.-based Internet giants.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last week the country’s data protection watchdog moved closer to fining Google for the way it stores and tracks user information after the search engine ignored a three-month ultimatum to bring its practices in line with local law.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">France has called on the European Union to regulate global Internet companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook more aggressively, to counter their growing dominance of online commerce and services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is pushing within the OECD and G20 organisations to tighten tax rules to make sure that Internet companies cannot avoid tax by locating their headquarters in low-cost EU countries. Amazon and Google are subject of ongoing tax audits in France.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document NYTFEED020131003e9a40030d</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="126" height="40" alt="image" src="NYT 13-14 3 end/Image_094.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark182">finance</a><a name="bookmark183">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">The screen’s the thing in new Kindle; Pogue&#39;s Posts</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BY DAVID POGUE</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">927 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 October 2013 International Herald Tribune INHT</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">20</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If it’s October, that must mean the holiday buying season has begun — and that means Amazon will offer a new color tablet.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s the Kindle Fire HDX. The 7-inch, or 18-centimeter, model costs $230, and it’s terrific. A 9-inch sibling is $380. The battery goes for about 11 hours, or 17 hours in a power-saving, reading-only mode. The stereo speakers sound great. The plastic case weighs less than the prior version and has narrower margins around the screen. There’s a mediocre camera on the front for video chatting and, on the 9-inch, or 23 centimeter, model, also an</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8-megapixel camera for taking pictures. The one big misfire was putting the power and volume keys on the back; you’ll spend the first week hitting the ‘‘off’’ button by mistake while trying to turn up the sound.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The X in HDX refers to the screen’s clarity. It packs in 323 tiny dots per inch, making it sharper than high definition, and making the iPad Mini’s 163 dots per inch look coarse.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The HDX’s screen really is spectacular, if infuriatingly reflective.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The trouble is, you can see the new sharpness only when you’re looking at source material with resolution that high. The type in books and magazines looks razor-sharp, but most of the 150,000 television shows and videos in Amazon’s catalog don’t look any clearer. Movies are also the wrong shape for the screen; you see black bands above and below.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although the Kindle is based on the Android operating system, Amazon has thoroughly disguised it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The home screen still features a sliding horizontal ‘‘carousel’’ of everything you’ve had open recently — books, movies, music, apps. Below that carousel, you now see a traditional grid of icons, just as on other tablets. Good.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Parental controls are easy and effective. You can limit your kids’ time each day or limit which items they can use, watch or read.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has started to bring its X-ray trivia feature to movies and music. Some of the songs you buy from Amazon (a few thousand, apparently) now display scrolling lyrics. And watching a movie with the X-ray panel open is great fun in that it identifies the actors in the scene before you, offers their bios in one tap, and tells you the name of the song playing in the background.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company says that in an upcoming software update, you’ll be able to fling the video to a PlayStation 3 or a Samsung TV, while continuing to read the X-ray details on your Kindle Fire. That doesn’t fully compensate, however, for the loss of any other way to connect the Fire to a TV: the HDMI jack is gone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Boldest and most stunning of all, though, is ‘‘Mayday’’: a button that places an instant, free video call to a 24-hour help technician. The agents can see your screen, but can’t see you. You can see the agents (in a tiny, 1-inch movable window), and accept their invitation to take control of your Kindle or draw with virtual highlighters around elements of the screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mayday is amazing and truly practical, but keep in mind that the HDX won’t be for sale until later this month. Will there be enough of those video agents to go around, especially Christmas week?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, $230 is an excellent price for a tablet this fast, smooth and satisfying — and this Amazon tablet finally includes a wall charger. It’s $30 more than last year’s model, but bargain hunters might be happy with the</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">revamped Kindle Fire HD, which is only $140 despite being, as a rep told me, ‘‘more performant.’’ I’m pretty sure that’s supposed to mean ‘‘faster.’’</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But $230 also happens to be the price of Google’s Nexus 7 tablet, which is also fast, smooth and satisfying, and also has a 323-dots-per-inch screen. On the Kindle, though, you see a full-screen ad every time you turn on the device; getting rid of them forever costs another $15. For another $50, you can buy a cover that attaches magnetically and folds in weird ways to act as a stand.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So which is the better deal?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Depends on what you’re looking for. The Nexus is a real tablet, with all of the flexibility and complexity that entails. The Kindle Fire is still clearly intended to show off the books, TV shows, music and videos you’ve bought from Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It still doesn’t seem like a ‘‘real’’ tablet. There’s still no GPS navigation, no speech recognition, no to-do list or notes app. It doesn’t run standard Android apps, and can’t access the Google Play store that houses a million of them. About 100,000 apps have been tailored for the Fire, but lots of important ones are missing — including Dropbox, SkyDrive and anything by Google.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That’s not a slam, either. The Kindle’s simplicity and dedication to its purpose has always been its primary virtue. Amazon should tread carefully; piling on features risks junking up this focused, efficient reader. Already, the company intends to add ‘‘enterprise’’ features in a software update this autumn: VPN access, Office-compatible productivity suite, hardware data encryption and so on.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">But never mind. As it is, the Kindle Fire HDX is a lightweight, sharp-screened, superfast pleasure.

Click on a specific work, and you get details about size and medium, a short biographical sketch of the artists, and, lower down on the page, a horizontal lineup of the artist’s other works for sale on Amazon Art. A zoom feature allows you to inspect areas of interest close up.

It arrived the next morning in a sturdy cardboard</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mailing tube via UPS.
