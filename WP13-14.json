        "content": " \"Transparent,\" a new 10-episode dramedy that begins streaming Friday on Amazon Prime, is a precise and comically downbeat little portrait of a family - the Pfeffermans - in which self-fulfillment overtook intimacy. The ennui is linked to entitlement; in this family, everyone was too busy grabbing for what he or she wanted. Everyone, that is, except for the paterfamilias, Mort Pfefferman (\"Arrested Development's\" Jeffrey Tambor), a retired college professor. Late in life and long after a divorce from Shelly (Judith Light), the mother of his three adult children, Mort has decided to end his private anguish and live openly as his truest self, taking his first steps to coming out as a woman named Maura. Encouraged by her transgender support group in West Hollywood, Maura feels ready to tell her children. But when they arrive at her home - summoned to a dinner of takeout barbecue at the house in which they all grew up - Maura instead greets them once more as the father they knew. She's afraid of telling them, but also she can't get a word in edgewise. Instead, Mort tells them he's going to sell the house, setting off an argument about who gets what. \"They're so selfish,\" Maura says, describing her children to her support group. \"I don't see how it is that I raised three people who cannot see beyond themselves.\" That seems to be the show's core message: Each of the Pfeffermans, Maura included, suffer the loneliness that comes with self-absorption. As TV characters, they will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has spent enough time attending low-budget indie films or watching premium cable shows that are all about vaguely unhappy people who, more often than not, live in sun-soaked Los Angeles, where all the vaguely depressed television writers and producers live, too. \"Transparent\" can at times feel like a skewed home movie intended for comfortably upper-middle class, nominally Jewish families from West L.A.; indeed, the show's intro is a collage of images culled from old home movies and videotapes of weddings, bar mitzvahs and drag shows. \"Transparent\" creator Jill Soloway (whose past work includes time at \"Six Feet Under\" and \"The United States of Tara\") has sculpted Maura's brood from the same narcissistic clay that brought audiences such memorably complicated characters as Amy Jellicoe from HBO's short-lived \"Enlightened\" or the array of Catherine Keener characters in the films of Nicole Holofcener. If you fondly recognize any of those references, then it's a good bet that \"Transparent\" just became your favorite new series of the fall season. Maura's oldest, Sarah (Amy Landecker), is a straight, stay-at-home mom with a full-time housekeeper and an obsession with the lesbian lover (Melora Hardin) from her college days, who has recently come back into Sarah's life and upended her marriage. Maura's son, Josh (Jay Duplass), is a successful record-label producer with a fairly typical assortment of hipster hang-ups, sexual and otherwise. The youngest child is Ali (Gaby Hoffmann), who is unemployed and spends a fair amount of time on drugs and not following through on ideas for books she intends to write, living off occasional checks from her father. What should really be a show about Maura's journey instead presents her as the more stable, normal and approximately most noble character here - though Maura is not without flaws. Tambor gives a striking performance that perfectly captures both the forlorn and optimistic moments in Maura's life, making great use of both his comic chops and his Droopy Dog face. Landecker, Duplass and Hoffmann are equally captivating as a trio of slightly despicable yet entirely relatable siblings, honing each character's attendant hurts and shortcomings into a broader story of shared dysfunction. Although each episode clocks in around 30 minutes, \"Transparent\" has an almost \"Nurse Jackie\"-like ability to make such good use of that half-hour that you almost feel as if you've watched an hourlong episode. The writing is subtle and economical yet full. It's one of those rare shows that you could binge through in a matter of hours (Amazon is making all the episodes available at once), but it might work better if you space them out over several days. (Since the customer is always right in television consumption these days, that's up to you. And speaking of customers, here's your usual disclosure that Amazon and The Washington Post share an owner.) Despite the fact that it's tracking the stories of four separate Pfeffermans, \"Transparent\" still manages to find time to flash back 20-plus years, where viewers get some idea of how long Mort has desired to be Maura. \"The West Wing's\" Bradley Whitford makes a cameo appearance (\"Transparent\" is loaded with actors you'll fleetingly recognize) as Marcy, Maura's first gender-questioning confidante. \"Transparent\" is also particularly good at seamlessly imparting some \"Trans 101\" to viewers who will come at the story from different levels of enlightenment and preconceptions. Without the sort of sermonizing that came with other films and TV shows about transgender women and men, the scripts and storylines artfully acquaint a viewer with the basic manners of gender identity. But rather than turn \"Transparent\" into a statement about the transgender experience, Soloway and her co-writers treat Maura's journey mainly as one of many compelling story arcs, and they aren't afraid to let it be as odd or awkward as it wants to be. In her tentative new life, perhaps only Maura stands the chance of finding a happiness that her children, in their blindness, may never know. Transparent (10 episodes) begins streaming Friday on Amazon Prime Instant Video. WP20140926stuever0926",

        "name": "Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin to supply engines for national security space launches; Amazon founder\u2019s Blue Origin signed a deal to put the vroom-vroom in national security space launches. ",
        "content": " Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos popped up in Washington on Wednesday to announce his latest business venture: His low-profile space company, Blue Origin, will supply engines for the rockets that launch America's military and national security satellites. The announcement, at the National Press Club, featured Bezos, who last year bought The Washington Post, and Tory Bruno, the chief executive of United Launch Alliance, which has a virtual monopoly on the nation's most sensitive rocket launches. Also on hand: A two-foot-tall model of a rocket engine, the BE-4. The full-size version is about 12 feet tall, Bezos said. \"I think it's pretty clear that it's time for a 21st-century engine booster system,\" Bezos said. This is a historic partnership between \"Old Space\" and \"New Space.\" United Launch Alliance (ULA) is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Blue Origin is a start-up fueled by Bezos money. Now ULA will invest in the development of the BE-4 engine. Neither executive would discuss a dollar figure, although it's probably somewhat less than $1 billion. Bruno said a typical liquid-fueled rocket engine takes seven years and $1 billion to develop, but Blue Origin is already several years along on the BE-4. Bruno said the engine could be ready within four years to serve as the main engine on the company's Atlas V rockets. The agreement instantly propels the publicity-shy Blue Origin into the mainstream of the aerospace industry. The company rarely issues a news release and has long preferred to let other New Space companies, most notably Elon Musk's SpaceX, garner headlines. That circumspection \u2014 the way Blue Origin developed its new engine \"without hype, without fanfare\" \u2014 is one reason ULA was attracted to Blue Origin, Bruno said. The deal also solves a major problem for ULA. The company's Atlas V rocket uses as its main engine the Russian-made RD-180, a powerful booster developed in the Soviet era and now the workhorse of America's fleet of big rockets. The disintegration of relations between the United States and Russia in recent months has called attention to ULA's reliance on the Russian hardware. At one point this summer, a top Russian official suggested that the supply of engines would be cut off. That threat appears to have been mere bluster, and ULA recently obtained two RD-180s, with more on the way. But Congress and the military are eager to see ULA develop alternatives to the RD-180. \"I think the U.S. needs to have an American-made booster engine. And, finally, I think, for humanity, we need access to space,\" Bezos said in an interview after the news conference. \"This will move all of those things forward. And I feel great about it.\" Asked about his overarching goal, he said, \"What we want to have happen is millions of people living and working in space.\" The partnership would not preclude ULA's using other rocket engines. But Bezos said, \"Our goal is to make the engine so operable, so low-cost and so reliable, that ULA would be crazy to use anything else.\" The deal delicately inserts Blue Origin into NASA's plans to launch American astronauts once again from American soil. Since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011, NASA astronauts have had to ride on Russian rockets at a cost of $71 million a seat. On Tuesday, NASA announced that it had awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, totaling $6.8 billion, to carry astronauts to the International Space Station as early as 2017 under the new \"commercial crew\" program. Boeing's space capsule will launch on the Atlas V. That means that, at some point, American astronauts could be blasted into space using rockets equipped with Blue Origin engines. Tuesday's announcement that SpaceX would be one of the two companies delivering astronauts to orbit represented a triumphal moment for the New Space movement led by Musk, who in barely a decade has turned SpaceX into a major player in aerospace. But Musk had to share the spotlight Tuesday with Bezos after the Wall Street Journal reported on the surprising Blue Origin-ULA deal and the companies revealed that Bezos would join Bruno on Wednesday at the National Press Club news conference. Bezos made his fortune turning Amazon.com from a start-up bookseller into an all-purpose retailer and Internet hosting service. But he has been fascinated by space travel since childhood and has reportedly poured half a billion dollars into Blue Origin, which is located outside Seattle in Kent, Wash. Until now, Blue Origin had touted its plans to create suborbital and eventually orbital spaceships that could carry people into space, but the company had little to show for its efforts. At a conference last year in New Mexico, Blue Origin executive Bretton Alexander showed a video of an engine test \u2014 the BE-3, a precursor to the engine ULA is investing in \u2014 and said the company's philosophy is \"low cost, reusability and safety.\" He said Blue Origin's goal is \"more people flying in space to do more things.\" That seemed years away, though. The Blue Origin suborbital spacecraft, New Shepard, has never been launched into space. Bezos said Wednesday that crewed flights of that vehicle could take place toward the end of this decade. The BE-4 engine could be used for orbital spacecraft, Bezos said. The ULA deal obviously gives Blue Origin a boost when discussing those kinds of ambitious plans, which previously had incited derision from Musk. Last year, during a dispute between Blue Origin and SpaceX over access to a space shuttle launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center, Musk took a shot at Blue Origin's achievements so far. \"If they do somehow show up in the next 5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA's human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what Pad 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,\" Musk wrote in an e-mail published at SpaceNews.com. \"Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.\" In an interview later in the fall with The Washington Post, Musk said of Bezos: \"He doesn't want people to think he's getting distracted from Amazon. Every time I talk to Jeff, I tell him to spend more time on Blue Origin. . . . Advancing spaceflight is more important.\" When a reporter asked Bezos on Wednesday how he manages his time, given his disparate interests, he said: \"Amazon is my day job. I love Amazon.\" He went on: \"I'm very, very lucky. I get to live and work in the future. And so that is fantastic.\" He said he doesn't have any hobbies such as golf. But he does have the space bug. \"You don't choose your passions; your passions choose you,\" Bezos said. \"For me, space is something that I have been in love with since I was 5 years old. I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the surface of the moon, and I guess it imprinted me.\" joel.achenbach@washpost.com",

        "content": " You'll know within five minutes (maybe less) if this deliciously morose 10-episode dramedy is your kind of thing, and if it's not . . . well, I'm sorry to see you go, because \"Transparent\" is the best streaming-network pilot since Netflix's \"Orange Is the New Black.\" It's also the first real sign that Amazon (which, yes, happens to share an owner with The Washington Post) could well become a formidable presence on television's future landscape. Written and directed by Jill Soloway (\"Six Feet Under,\" \"The United States of Tara\"), \"Transparent\" revolves around Maura (\"Arrested Development's\" Jeffrey Tambor), a transitioning woman who is ready to come out to her three grown children, who still think of her as their father. \"Transparent\" isn't playing any of this for big laughs and instead mines the absurdities and indignities of real life in a comic tone that seems to hit the right spot these days. It's also a very L.A. kind of show in that everyone has rather First-World L.A. problems: Maura's eldest daughter, Sarah (Amy Landecker), is a harried mom obsessed with a former lover; son Josh (Jay Duplass) is a neurotic and immature record producer; and younger daughter Ali (Gaby Hoffmann) is a chronically underemployed writer and halfhearted libertine. All three are just the sort of people you'd conjure up if you were writing a premium half-hour TV pilot about a vaguely unhappy family, but they are also instantly recognizable as 21st-century narcissists. \"They're so selfish,\" Maura tells her transgender support group. \"I don't see how it is that I raised three people who cannot see beyond themselves.\" A-",

        "name": "Should you invest in Alibaba? And 9 other questions about the world\u2019s biggest IPO ",
        "content": " In the late 1990s, a 34-year-old Chinese schoolteacher named Jack Ma, working from his cramped apartment, unveiled a small, colorful, chaotic Web service he named after an old folk tale. Fifteen years later, that company, Alibaba, has become the world's largest online retailer \u2014 and the biggest company you may have never heard of. Its marketplaces were home to $248 billion in sales last year, more than Amazon.com and eBay combined. Led by Ma, now China's richest billionaire, Alibaba will take its biggest step yet toward global retail domination this week when it begins selling shares to the public for the first time in what's called an initial public offering, or IPO. The company is predicted to raise more than $24 billion, the biggest stock-market debut in history. But you can be forgiven if you've never heard of Alibaba. Though a household name in China, one of the world's largest e-commerce markets, Alibaba has remained a relative unknown in the United States. Here are 10 quick things to know about how Alibaba took over the Web. 1. So: Alibaba? Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is a massive, elaborate, wildly profitable company that dominates online buying and selling in China: Eighty percent of the stuff sold online there goes through an Alibaba site. Like eBay and other online marketplaces, Alibaba doesn't own the stuff that it sells on its Web site: It takes a cut from sellers who use it and charges a little extra to advertise. Outside of its main markets, the company has tentacles in a lot of different business lines, including payment services and cloud computing. It started in 1999 as a way to connect Chinese factories and suppliers with global retailers, and in the years since it has rode skyward atop China's rapidly expanding middle class. Their increased spending and Internet use have created one of the world's biggest Web-business goldmines, and investors are hungry to jump on IPOs, like Alibaba's, that have run so parallel to China's rise. When Alibaba was founded, 9 million people in China used the Internet. Last year, that number had climbed past 600 million, or nearly twice the U.S. population. Though Alibaba's main marketplaces look a lot like America's online auction houses, the group has developed a quintessentially Chinese sensibility, said Gil Luria, a managing director covering financial technology stocks at Wedbush Securities. They look less like storefronts \u2014 with their fixed prices and stable supplies \u2014 than thriving, bustling bazaars. \"The reason [Alibaba's top marketplace] Taobao won China is they were particularly able to customize the experience to the Chinese consumer: the look and feel, the friendliness, the attitude of the Web site, the ability to chat between buyer and seller for negotiation,\" Luria said. \"Those are things that are distinct between the Chinese marketplace and the American marketplace.\" An IPO allows a private company to \"go public,\" by selling shares to public investors on the stock market. IPOs provide companies and shareholders two huge benefits: They give investors a way to grab a potentially lucrative piece of a fast-growing start-up, and they let the business raise, in this case, a staggering amount of money while also boosting their global reputation. IPOs are highly watched because the companies' values are largely set by how willing investors are to pay for their shares. You may remember the hubbub over Facebook's IPO, in 2012, when it made its $16 billion market debut. Alibaba, which plans to sell each of its 320 million shares for between $66 and $68, is expected to set its initial stock price Thursday and start trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BABA. The high price is a show of confidence in Alibaba's future growth, and investors seem more than willing to pay up. During Alibaba's international \"roadshows\" \u2014 the name companies give to their traveling IPO pep rallies \u2014 lines of eager investors have stretched out the door. At the midpoint of its share price, Alibaba would be valued at about $165 billion, larger than Amazon.com. (Note: Amazon.com's founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) But Alibaba's huge starting price does have one drawback: It would need to keep growing like crazy to deliver even moderate returns. One example: Amazon, which went public at a $438 million valuation, is now valued at around $160 billion, meaning early investors have made about 365 times what they first spent. For Alibaba investors to see similar returns, its valuation would need to grow into the trillions. How big is Alibaba? Very big. According to company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Chinese buyers made about 11 billion orders on Alibaba marketplaces last year, trading $248 billion in goods and services. As a low-cost portal for other people's merchandise, it's hyper-profitable, with its $7.95 billion in revenue last year netting Alibaba a 45 percent profit margin. (Over the same time, eBay's was about 18 percent.) At the same time, Alibaba's satellite companies have seen their own huge success. Its PayPal-like service, Alipay, has been used to move $519 billion in payments, more than double PayPal's $180 billion. Alibaba counts about 280 million individual shoppers and small businesses as active buyers, a user base that has doubled in the last two years, SEC filings show. And those buyers are becoming more and more reliant on Alibaba's offerings: The average active buyer made 49 orders last year, up from 33 in 2011. I'm in the United States. Why should I care? Alibaba's native access to China's low-cost producers could bring some major competition to American storefronts, potentially tamping down prices or helping change where buyers shop, analysts said. Alibaba also wants to appeal to Americans directly through a U.S.-aimed marketplace, 11 Main, now open by invitation only. Many small American businesses already use Alibaba to solicit bids from low-cost manufacturers and suppliers. Its stated mission is \"to make it easy to do business anywhere,\" and Alibaba's huge IPO bump in funding and reputation could lead even more businesses to seek it out. Analysts said Alibaba seems most interested in growing its base in China. But the group does not seem content to just stay the world's largest online retailer. It's investing in mobile browsers, film production and social media, and the IPO will give it billions more dollars to extend its reach \u2014 in China and, possibly, the United States. \"In the past decade, we measured ourselves by how much we changed China,\" Ma wrote in a letter to potential investors. \"In the future, we will be judged by how much progress we bring to the world.\" Where's Jack Ma now? The former school teacher who founded Alibaba in his apartment is, at age 50, now China's richest person, with a net worth of $21.9 billion. He'll remain the face of Alibaba after the company's IPO. Alibaba's corporate structure gives Ma and his top partners a strong lock on the company's control. Much has beenwritten about the charismatic founder once called \"Crazy Jack,\" so we'll just include this one example. To celebrate Alibaba's 10th anniversary, Ma dressed in leather, black lipstick, a nose ring and a towering mohawk to sing Elton John's \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" to a Chinese stadium filled with 16,000 employees. (He sings a lot.) What's with the name? Ma said the name comes from \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,\" the Arabic folk tale best known for a magical phrase, \"Open sesame,\" used to unlock a door to hidden treasures. As Ma told an interviewer, Alibaba \"opens sesame for small- to medium-sized companies.\" It's also easy to spell. (In China, the company is called \u963f\u91cc\u5df4\u5df4, pronounced A li ba ba.) The name of Alibaba's top marketplace, Taobao, means in Chinese, \"to find treasure.\" Why is a Chinese company having an initial public offering in the United States? Lots of Chinese companies choose to go public by listing their stock in Hong Kong, China's massive financial hub. But the region rebuffed Alibaba's listing because of the company's unusual leadership structure, in which a small crew of company insiders controls the board of directors, and its direction, more than ordinary shareholders ever could. America's big stock exchanges don't bristle at those kinds of systems \u2014 Facebook, Google and other U.S. companies also use \"dual-class\" share structures \u2014 so Alibaba brought its listing to New York. That was huge news for the exchange, which collects fees from listed companies and will likely see a boost in trading revenues. What else does Alibaba do? Let's break it down. It runs Taobao, China's largest online bazaar, and Tmall, a more polished marketplace catering to bigger brands. Then there are wholesale marketplaces, such as Alibaba.com, which caters to international customers, and 1688.com, which caters to Chinese small businesses. Besides that, there's Aliyun, for cloud and Web services, and Alipay, a PayPal-like service controlled by Ma and other Alibaba executives that can, among other things, hold buyers' payment to manufacturers in escrow until they say they're satisfied with their goods. The group also has sizable stakes in Sina Weibo (think Twitter) and Youku Tudou (think YouTube). If that sounds like a lot, it is. But that diversity has won a considerable amount of applause from some investors. As Ma told investors in Hong Kong, according to the Wall Street Journal, he wants Alibaba to be a \"zoo that houses many animals rather than a farm which just has one animal.\" Why does it matter that Alibaba is based in China? China is a force to be reckoned with in online retail, even though its population is much less wired than that of the United States. Only 46 percent of China's consumers have access to the Internet, compared with 82 percent in the United States, according to the McKinsey Global Institute: Its origins in China have brought a few cultural quirks. Alibaba's biggest shopping day last year was Nov. 11, Singles Day, a satirical Chinese holiday celebrating the unmarried. Taobao and Tmall logged nearly $6 billion in sales in one day. It also brings a big wildcard. The Chinese government wields powerful influence over the country's economic growth by spending money, imposing regulations and, as Alibaba said in a securities filing, \"providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\" In other words, how Alibaba succeeds or fails could depend largely on China's power elite, and that's not very encouraging news for surprise-averse investors. At Alibaba's presentation Monday in Hong Kong, Ma reportedly told investors to \"think about us just like any other Internet company that happens to be in China.\" But the company has not been subtle about its particularly close ties with Chinese government leaders. Ma told a New York crowd that maintaining relationships with Chinese state officials was a top priority. \"Because of their close relationships there, it puts Alibaba Group in a very favorable position in partnering with the government in high-potential, high-growth, high-regulation industries\" like investing and online banking, said Henry Guo, a senior research analyst for JG Capital. \"If the government wants to partner with a company who's doing something big and new, Alibaba is a no. 1 partner in that.\" Sounds interesting. Should I invest? It's probably too late to jump on the first shares: U.S.-based investors needed to have their orders in by Tuesday afternoon, and Alibaba will close its books to new orders in Asia and Europe on Wednesday. Then it plans to set a final price for shares Thursday, with trading to begin Friday. Once the company is public, it's off to the races, and anyone can buy a share. As to whether you should, that's, of course, up to you. A lot of American investors have gotten excited over what seems like the clearest way to bet on China's growth. But some have questioned the company's convoluted maze of business interests and unorthodox leadership. Alibaba itself has said its future in China, due to the state government's whims and regulations, could prove hard to predict. And with rapid changes in Web retail and mobile payments, Alibaba's success is far from guaranteed. (For a hint of the danger, look to Alibaba's own SEC filings, where their stated \"risk factors\" total nearly 27,000 words.) Alibaba's listing in New York, and its mammoth size, could give the company a better chance at success. But Chinese companies haven't typically blown the markets away. Chinese companies listed on American stock markets have seen their shares drop 1 percent every year on average for the next three years, far below the 7 percent average yearly gain for other U.S. IPOs, according to research by University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter. In a letter to employees shortly before Alibaba filed for its IPO in May, Ma acknowledged the hazards of going public with such a monstrous listing. But in a tone reminiscent of his schoolhouse past, he also remained chipper about Alibaba's months ahead. \"Lying behind the massive allure of the capital market, there is unparalleled ruthlessness and pressure,\" he wrote. \"The past 15 years have been difficult and exciting. Every single day of the future is bound to be extraordinary and complicated. If we don't put in the effort today, we might not see the sunshine the day after tomorrow.",

        "content": " Amazon.com announced six new tablets and e-readers on Wednesday, the latest sign that the Web retailer is trying to reach consumers through devices on which it can sell more books, movies and TV shows. The tech giant said it is introducing two e-readers, two updates to the Kindle Fire tablet line, a kid-focused version of the Kindle Fire and a tablet for power-users. All became available for pre-order Wednesday; Amazon said the devices should make their way to consumers sometime in October. Amazon showed little interest in the device market for years, focusing almost entirely on the Kindle e-reader that it introduced in 2007 as a vehicle to sell e-books. But since launching the Kindle Fire tablet in 2011, Amazon has moved aggressively to compete with firms such asApple, Samsung, Google and Microsoft in the tablet market  and to complement its ambitious, multimillion-dollar expansion in the media world. Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post, remains bullish on e-readers, even though some analysts say the market might have peaked in 2012. The latest addition to the line is the Kindle Voyage, a six-inch e-reader with a lighted e-ink screen and pressure-sensitive sensors that let users squeeze to advance or go back a page. Amazon is also releasing a lower-end, basic e-reader without a light. It starts at $79 and offers twice as much storage as Amazon's previous entry-level Kindle. The company also unveiled a new six-inch Fire tablet that starts at $99 and comes in five colors. A seven-inch version of the tablet starts at $139. Both boast clear sound, fast processors and crisp displays that are rare to see at that price. Despite its obsession with low prices, Amazon also released a new high-end tablet, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, which starts at $379. The device, a competitor to Apple's iPad and Samsung's premium Galaxy tablets, has advanced processors, a clearer screen and speakers with Dolby-designed surround sound. The HDX is also designed to work with a new Fire keyboard from Amazon, sold separately for about $60, so that users can use the tablet more effectively for spreadsheets and other work documents.

And in most cases, he said, that comes from building less expensive gadgets that take full advantage of Amazon's own software and services. The strategy hasn't always worked. In June, Amazon jumped into the smartphone market with the Fire Phone, a sensor-laden smartphone designed to give users direct access to Amazon's online store. Just six weeks later, the firm slashed the phone's price from $200 to 99 cents; Amazon hasn't released official sales numbers for the phone, but many analysts say the cut was due to lackluster sales. Still, Amazon isn't straying from its well-worn formula with these new devices. With a new kid-focused version of the Kindle Fire tablet -- for children ages 3 to 10 -- Amazon is also including a year's subscription to its Kindle FreeTime Unlimited service. That service, which is normally a $30 per year add-on to the company's Prime service, gives parents and children unlimited access to hand-picked apps, games and videos made for kids. Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, remains bullish on e-readers, even though the market may have peaked already in 2012. Limp called e-readers one of the company's \"passions.\" The latest addition to the line is the Kindle Voyage, a six-inch e-reader with a lighted e-ink screen and pressure-sensitive sensors that let you squeeze to advance or go back a page. Amazon is also releasing a lower-end, basic e-reader without a light, starting at $79, which offers twice as much storage as Amazon's previous entry-level Kindle. The company also unveiled a new six-inch Fire tablet, which starts at $99, and comes in five colors. A 7-inch version of the tablet starts at $139. Both boast clear sound, fast processors and crisp displays that are very rare to see at that price. Despite its obsession with low prices, Amazon also released a new high-end tablet, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 , which starts at $379. The device, a competitor to Apple's iPad and Samsung's premium Galaxy tablets, has advanced processors, a clearer screen and speakers with Dolby designed surround sound. The new HDX is also designed to work with a new Fire keyboard from Amazon, sold separately for about $60, so that users can use the tablet more effectively for spreadsheets and other work documents. That's a bit of a shift for Amazon tablets, which have always been marketed more as devices to consume content rather than create it. Limp said that the shift was driven by customer use. \"We have seen a trend, generation on generation, that people are using them more for productivity use cases,\" he said. \"As you start seeing customer input like that, you want to encourage it -- throw kindling on that fire, if you will.\" Amazon may build a business-focused tablet down the road, he said. The company has been slowly adding features suited to workplace devices, such as encryption. \"Will it take a long time? Yes,\" Limp said. \"But we have to get the building blocks, and keep making progress. And the early signs are good.\"",

        "name": "Surge, everyone\u2019s favorite \u201990s soda, is back, and it\u2019s already selling like crazy ",
        "content": " Coca-Cola has a little surprise for '90s nostalgics: Surge soda, the company's equivalent to Mountain Dew, is back. The global soda giant began selling the \"fully loaded citrus soda\" on Monday, more than 12 years since the brand was discontinued. The relaunch is part of a combined effort with Amazon.com, the only place where 12-packs of 16-ounce cans are being sold. \"SURGE is back!\" the product landing page reads. It's also selling like crazy. Amazon ran out of initial supplies of Surge only hours after Coca-Cola first announced the re-release Monday morning, according to the Huffington Post. Amazon managed to restock its supply of the novelty soda, but not for long\u2014 as of Tuesday afternoon, the online retailer is once again out of Surge. Customers can sign up to receive an e-mail once the soda is in stock again. Coca-Cola debuted Surge in 1996, at a time when PepsiCo's Mountain Dew enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the U.S. market for citrus sodas. That year, Pepsi's offering accounted for more than three-quarters of all \"heavy citrus\" soda sales, while Coca-Cola's, Mello Yello, struggled, according to a New York Times article from that December. Like Mountain Dew, the new brand, known as Surge, will be a bright, greenish-yellow citrus drink that will be high in calories and caffeine, compared with other soft drinks. Coke has been slow to mount a credible challenge to Mountain Dew, which had retail sales of $3 billion last year in the $52 billion industry, placing it first among so-called heavy citrus sodas. Mello Yello, which Coke has marketed regionally since 1979, has been a distant second.With Surge, Coca-Cola managed to bite a chunk out of Mountain Dew's dominance. Just three years later, in 1999, Mountain Dew's market share had fallen just over 66 percent. Advertisements for the new soda were nearly as excitable as the demand. But soon the appeal of highly-caffeinated drinks waned, and schools, retailers and supermarkets stopped carrying it. In 2002, after years of falling sales, Coca-Cola pulled Surge from production. The resurgence of Surge is owed at least in part to the soda's vocal social media fans, according to Coca-Cola. The Surge Movement, which was created for the sole purpose of bringing the citrus soda back into production, has nearly 150,000 likes on Facebook. The same community raised nearly $4,000 on Indie GoGo to buy a billboard near Coca-Cola's headquarters that read \"Dear Coke, we couldn't buy SURGE, so we bought this billboard instead.\" \"Eventually, their creativity and passionate pleas caught the company's attention,\" Coca-Cola said in a statement. The return of Surge marks not only the first time Coca-Cola has reintroduced a discontinued product to the market, but also the first time Coca-Cola has sold any soda product exclusively online. If Surge continues to sell as it has over the past day, it likely won't be the last online exclusive. \"If expectations are met, this may be only the first of a variety of efforts we explore to launch niche products through e-commerce relationships,\" Wendy Clark, Coca-Cola's president of sparkling and strategic marketing, said in a written statement.",

        "name": "How Alibaba will change the way we think about Chinese tech ",
        "content": " The Alibaba IPO marks the beginning of a new era for how we think and write about China's Internet companies, and it's all being driven by Wall Street and the way it values companies. Everyone knows that Alibaba dominates the Chinese e-commerce market and that its upcoming initial public offering will be the biggest Internet IPO ever, dwarfing the size of the Facebook IPO in 2012. Now comes the hard part \u2014 going beyond all the basic elevator pitch explanations (\"it's the Chinese Amazon\" or \"it's the Chinese eBay\") and actually figuring out how the company makes all of its money. The IPO road show Alibaba is doing right now is all about trying to get the messaging right so that both retail and institutional investors \"get\" Alibaba and the IPO pops on the first day of trading. Think back to other big Internet IPOs. Retail investors were initially eager to buy into the Facebook IPO in 2012 or the Twitter IPO in 2013 because they understood what they did and how they made money (or, at least, how they planned to make money). That's a much bigger hurdle for Alibaba, which is usually described as something like the Amazon of China. Easy to grasp, but is it really accurate? Browse through even a few minutes of the Alibaba roadshow videos available on YouTube, and it's clear that the Alibaba e-commerce model differs significantly from the Amazon e-commerce model. Alibaba's model is more of an eBay marketplace model and the primary share of the company's profits come from providing services that help buyers market their businesses to sellers. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Alibaba as more of a Google-like \"advertising platform\" than an e-commerce platform. And Alibaba does that through a vast ecosystem of marketplaces that sell just about everything. In fact, Alibaba's mission statement is: \"To make it easy to do business anywhere.\" And that's where Wall Street plays an important role in assigning a valuation to Alibaba. Investors like to be able to value all the components of a company properly. It's no longer about China as some kind of \"black box\" that stands for \"lots of potential money there.\" It sounds awesome that Alibaba dominates 52 percent of all e-commerce in China and that Alibaba sells 8 percent of everything in China. (By comparison, Walmart sells close to 10 percent of everything in America.) Alibaba has been growing at a blistering 50 percent pace as it expands into just about everything that can be sold online, but is that growth rate really sustainable? Investors want to be able to peer into that black box and see what's inside. When it comes to Alibaba, investors are paying a lot of attention to the convoluted \u2014 some use the word \"tortuous\" \u2014 management and ownership structure of Alibaba to see what they get with their money. They also want to see if the company has  economic moats to keep out competitors. What about that JD.com, for example, which controls just over 18 percent of the Chinese e-commerce market \u2014 is that company an also-ran or an up-and-comer? And how well positioned is Alibaba to make the leap into mobile commerce? Remember back to the big Facebook IPO in 2012? When people peered inside Facebook ahead of its IPO, it scared some forward-looking investors, and the stock nosedived after the IPO. There was huge concern on Wall Street that Facebook wasn't ready for the mobile era. In response, Facebook radically overhauled its approach to mobile. Within a year, Facebook derived 30 percent of its advertising revenue came from mobile. Facebook's current enterprise value \u2014 $188 billion \u2014 is higher than what Alibaba is being valued at in today's market terms ($148 billion). For good measure, Amazon has a total enterprise value of $155 billion. eBay \u2014 which has more of the marketplace model favored by Alibaba \u2014 has an enterprise value of only $55 billion. So which company would you rather hold in your portfolio a few weeks from now \u2014 Alibaba or Amazon? They have almost exactly the same valuations, but very different business models and very different growth perspectives. The same issues faced by Alibaba apply as well as to other Chinese tech companies such as Tencent or Xiaomi or Weibo. Or, for that matter, to Alibaba's closest competitor \u2014 JD.com. We've relied until now for a type of convenient (some might say lazy) shorthand for describing these Chinese companies \u2014 the \"Twitter of China\" (Weibo) or the \"Apple of China\" (Xiaomi). It's convenient to have this kind of shorthand in the early days as a type of elevator pitch for people with short attention spans. However, when it comes time to putting real money into a company, more is needed. That's why this Alibaba IPO is so important. It's time for China's tech companies to grow up. At the end of the day, it's business, not personal. If China's tech companies want Western money at Western valuations, then they need to explain how and why they differ from the Western market leaders. Is Alibaba really bigger and more valuable than Amazon? The days of blindly putting one's faith in the future growth rates of China's remarkable Internet companies are over. At some point in the near future, China's spectacular economic growth rates are going to come back down to earth, and that's when a solid understanding of Alibaba's business model is really going to matter.",

        "name": "Google agrees to pay $19 million in FTC in-app kids lawsuit ",
        "content": " Federal officials on Thursday announced Google has agreed to settle charges and repay $19 million to consumers whose children were allegedly deceived into making mobile purchases through the Android app store. Since 2011, according to the Federal Trade Commission, Google made it too easy for children to use Android phones to buy items ranging from 99 cents to $200 in kids-oriented games without a parent's permission. The settlement is the latest in the FTC's three-year investigation into so-called \"in-app purchases\" on devices running software by Apple, Amazon and Google. The enforcement agency has said the purchases are deceptive and particularly harmful for children. Apple agreed to a $32.5 million settlement last January. Amazon in July said it would fight similar charges brought by the FTC. The FTC has alleged that the major technology companies did not properly disclose to parents and children the ability to purchase items within games and other children's-oriented apps. Parents have filed civil lawsuits against the companies, too, criticizing the firms and apps developers for what they describe as predatory practices that target children to buy $99 gold coins and other items within games. Children, they say, were at times able to buy those items -- later billed to parents -- without any safeguards such as apps store passwords. Apple has changed its practices, and Amazon has offered parental safety tools to prevent unwanted purchases. \"For millions of American families, smartphones and tablets have become a part of their daily lives,\" FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a release. \"As more Americans embrace mobile technology, it's vital to remind companies that time-tested consumer protections still apply, including that consumers should not be charged for purchases they did not authorize.\" At first, Google didn't require passwords for in-app purchases. In 2012, though, following criticism from parents, it began to use pop-up password boxes. The FTC said the company didn't explain, however, that by putting in a password once, kids had a 30-minute window to rack up as many charges as they wanted. The FTC said even as Google faced a class action lawsuit and heavy criticism -- along with Apple and Amazon -- over in-app purchases being too easy for children, the company didn't do enough to explain its practices or change them to protect consumers. Parents, meanwhile, continue to complain about hundreds, even thousands of dollars in unauthorized charges. Parents said their kids didn't fully understand that a virtual in-app purchase for something like gold coins to advance game levels cost real money. The apps and software firms also made it too hard to understand their systems for in-app purchases, parents said. In its release, the FTC said Google employees internally referred to the problem as \"family fraud\" and \"friendly fraud.\" Apple and Google have changed their practices since the FTC's investigations and refund accounts. Last month, author and mother of four, Ayelet Waldman blasted the Kim Kardashian app after her son spent $120 for things like virtual clothing. Google said in a statement that it has worked to change its in-app purchases. \"We're glad to put this matter behind us so we can focus on creating more ways for people to enjoy all the entertainment they love,\" Google said. Google has agreed to fully refund unauthorized in-app charges incurred by children and get \"express, informed consent\" from consumers for in-app purchases. The company said all Android customers who have made in-app charges will hear from Google about how they can get refunds. Have more to say on this topic?

        "name": "Jill Soloway and what it takes to change the way we make pop culture ",
        "content": " The New York Times Magazine has a long look this weekend at Jill Soloway's \"Transparent,\" which will premiere its first season on Amazon Prime (disclosure: Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns this paper) on Sept. 26. The series is a fascinating exploration at a very particular period in transgender life: the time transgender people transition to living publicly in the gender that feels right to them, as opposed to the one they were assigned at birth. This obviously means a major social adjustment, and it can be a precursor to surgery. \"Transparent\" is also the rare show that does not simply capture a world in which there is apparently one transgender (or for that matter, one lesbian, gay or bisexual) person who exists mostly to educate the people in his or her life about the meaning of tolerance. I will have more thoughts on the content of the show when it comes to air, but I wanted to highlight one part of the Times piece, which describes how Soloway put the show together: To accomplish that, Soloway enacted a \"transfirmative action program,\" favoring the hiring of transgender candidates over nontransgender ones. It wasn't just a corrective to the trans community's high rates of unemployment. Soloway wanted to create a set on which inclusivity was more than a buzzword, a place where no one should ever feel that they are part of a majority \u2014 not even the majority, whoever that might be on a particular day. \"I really want it so that there's no moment, on the set, when trans people are being otherized by people in the crew because they don't think there are any trans people listening.\" As of this writing, 20 trans people had been hired in the cast and crew, and more than 60 had been employed as extras. I highlight this not because of any particular choice Soloway made, though many of them are interesting, but simply because it is a perfect illustration of the number of choices that go into making a television show or a movie. Changing the balance of representation in the media industry requires thinking about diversity every time you make every one of these choices on every single project. And given that this is a project-based industry, you can make all of these choices one year, only for the movie to be over or the TV show canceled the next. If you want to know why it is hard, these paragraphs are a pretty good illustration of the challenge. But they are also a strong illustration of the kind of comprehensive thinking that can make a difference.",

        "content": " Worldwide shipments of computer networking gear known as servers grew 1.3 percent year-over-year, while revenue grew 2.8 percent, according to a new report. Hewlett-Packard led the market in the second quarter, according to the research firm Gartner - it had just over 25 percent of market share, though the company's shipments declined 2.9 percent compared with the same quarter one year ago. HP shipped almost 570,000 units in the second quarter, taking in about $3.2 billion in server revenue.

(Standard disclosure: Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns the Washington Post, which does not get me access to these pilots any earlier than the rest of you.) I am curious about two things. First, which of the pilots do you like best? And second, what do you wish Amazon was doing that it is not already? Amazon has a lot going on \u2014 it has pulled in creators like Garry Trudeau and Whit Stillman, and in \"Transparent,\" it is telling a story about gender transition, a subject almost entirely invisible on American television. If this boldness is the new norm, what would you like to see Amazon pursue with it? I am very interested to see what happens when Netflix starts making shows set in different countries and with dialogue in different languages. Apparently, it takes the hateful harassment of bereaved relatives of famous people to get Twitter to make policy changes! Disney is the target of a lawsuit filed by parents of children with autism and other cognitive issues, which is interesting given that the company recently published a book by a father about reaching his autistic son through Disney movies. I am hard-pressed to think of things that Armond White and I agree with, but this list of movies he hates is a fascinating look inside his critical preferences. I actually think Charlie Hunnam would be a particularly terrific King Arthur in a remake of \"The Mists of Avalon,\" if anyone wanted to do that, but he will be just dandy as a regular King Arthur, too. Female television viewers are a big deal for American entertainment companies \u2014 at least in Spain. Shonda Rhimes is going to show up on an episode of \"The Mindy Project.\" Daniel Franzese is joining \"Looking.\" I prefer to think about this as Damian from \"Mean Girls\" finally getting to a city and a state of life where there is no such thing as \"too gay to function.\" \u2022\" The Walking Dead\" is getting a gay male character, but it may not be the one fans are hoping for.

        "name": "Amazon said to be close to acquiring Twitch; Reports have circled for months that Google, not Amazon, was close to buying Twitch. ",
        "content": " Twitch, the streaming site where users can watch other people play video games in real-time, is being acquired by Amazon.com, according to a report from the subscription technology news site, The Information. The site, run by former Wall Street Journal reporter Jessica Lessin, said Monday that Amazon.com has \"virtually sealed a deal to acquire\" the site for $1 billion. The report said that an unnamed \"person close to the transaction\" has said the deal could be announced \"shortly.\" The report was surprising given that there has been talk for months that the search firm Google had agreed to purchase Twitch for $1 billion. Neither Amazon nor Twitch immediately replied to requests for comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeffery P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Twitch is a service designed to let video gamers broadcast their games in real-time and has grown enormously popular in the past few years. According to a recent article by the Wall Street Journal, Twitch ranked fourth in terms of peak Internet traffic in the U.S. -- ahead of Hulu. How is that possible? For many, the idea that anyone would want to watch other people play video games may seem like a completely foreign concept. But for many fans, it's not that different from watching the broadcast of a sports game or poker match. \"Esports,\" the name for this type of competitive video game play, is already a major industry in places such as Korea and Germany, and has grown enormously in the past several years. During a big tournament, as many as one million people have tuned in at the same time on Twitch. The most popular video games that people like to watch others play are ones in which players battle each other in discrete matches, such as \"League of Legends,\" \"Call of Duty\" and \"Starcraft.\" There are gaming tournaments, in which players compete against each other for prize money -- The International, an annual e-sports tournament hosted by Valve for its \"Defense of the Ancients\" title, raised nearly $11 million in prize money from contributors for this year's prizes. Professional gamers and professional game commentators, such as Justine Ezarik and Manuel Schenkhuizen, have become celebrities in their own right. At least one college in Illinois has started offering scholarships for students who can play games competitively. Twitch has become the de facto home for online broadcasts of professional events, as well as a platform for amateurs to stream games via their home computers or gaming consoles. Viewers join the amateur players for live streams, sometimes to chat with others on Twitch about playing styles -- a sort of amplified version of sitting on the couch and watching friends play games. Rumors first surfaced that Google was close to a deal for the site in May, when Variety reported that the two firms had reached a preliminary deal. A subsequent report from VentureBeat's Dean Takahashi led many to believe that Google's Twitch acquisition was a done deal. Picking up Twitch would be a coup for Amazon, which has competed heavily with streaming video providers such as Netflix and Hulu, but has--until last month--not hosted any of the user-generated video that dominates sites such as Twitch and Google's YouTube.

        "name": "Amazon to acquire Twitch for about $970 million in cash ",
        "content": " Twitch, a streaming site where users can watch other people play video games in real time, is being acquired by Amazon.com for about $970 million in cash. The purchase, announced Monday, signifies the growing power of video-game culture - which has spawned tournaments and celebrity players - as well as Amazon's increasing ambitions in the media world. \"Broadcasting and watching gameplay is a global phenomenon and Twitch has built a platform that brings together tens of millions of people who watch billions of minutes of games each month,\" Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, said in a statement Monday. \"Like Twitch, we obsess over customers and like to think differently, and we look forward to learning from them and helping them move even faster to build new services for the gaming community.\" The news of the purchase was surprising, given that there has been talk for months that Google had agreed to buy Twitch for $1 billion. Twitch, a service designed to let video gamers broadcast their games in real time, has grown enormously popular in the past few years. According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, Twitch ranked fourth in peak Internet traffic in the United States, ahead of Hulu, a streaming Web site. For many, the idea that anyone would want to watch other people play video games may seem strange. But for many fans, it's not that different from watching the broadcast of a sports game or a poker match. \"Esports,\" the name for this type of competitive video game play, is a major industry in places such as South Korea and Germany, and has grown enormously over the past several years. During a big tournament, as many as 1 million people have tuned in on Twitch at the same time. The most popular video games that people like to watch others play are ones in which players battle one another in discrete matches, such as \"League of Legends,\" \"Call of Duty\" and \"Starcraft.\" There are gaming tournaments, in which players compete for prize money. The International, an annual e-sports tournament hosted by Valve for its \"Defense of the Ancients\" title, raised nearly $11 million in prize money from contributors for this year's prizes. Professional gamers and professional game commentators, such as Justine Ezarik and Manuel Schenkhuizen, have become celebrities in their own right. At least one college in Illinois has started offering scholarships for students who can play games competitively. Twitch has become the de facto home for online broadcasts of professional events, as well as a platform for amateurs to stream games via their home computers or gaming consoles. Viewers join the amateur players for live streams, sometimes to chat with others on Twitch about playing styles - a sort of amplified version of sitting on the couch and watching friends play games. Rumors first surfaced that Google was close to buying the site in May, when Variety reported that the two firms had reached a preliminary deal. A subsequent report from VentureBeat's Dean Takahashi led many to believe that Google's Twitch acquisition was a done deal. Picking up Twitch will be a coup for Amazon, which has competed heavily with streaming video providers such as Netflix and Hulu for TV shows and movies. The company has been expanding its media ambitions, announcing earlier Monday that it has given a green light to five pilots for children's shows, adding to its roster of original shows. The firm recently disclosed that it expects to spend at least $100 million on producing pilots and new series this quarter. But until last month, Amazon had not hosted any of the user-generated video that dominates sites such as Twitch and Google's YouTube. The company recently started hosting more YouTube-style videos on its site to advertise its products, including how-to videos on product pages for items such as curling irons. The firm also has taken steps to increase its presence in the gaming world, incorporating gaming features into its set-top video box, the Fire TV. The company has its own in-house video game studio, which releases games for the Fire TV. Michael Frazzini, vice president of Amazon Games, said in an interview with The Post that the Twitch acquisition will be a boon for the company's efforts in gaming. \"We have a lot of shared points of view about where this could go,\" he said. Twitch chief executive and co-founder Emmett Shear said that Amazon's willingness to let him remain chief executive and run Twitch independently was a major reason he agreed to the deal. \"We wound up going with Amazon because the premise of the deal is that we are fully independent,\" he said. \"That was not insignificant for me.\" Shear also said that Twitch could learn a lot from Amazon's cloud computing and advertising departments. \"This can accelerate what Twitch is doing,\" he said.

        "name": "Amazon will offer credit card reader ",
        "content": " Amazon.com announced Wednesday that it might soon be coming to a checkout register, food truck or farmers market near you. The online retailer has unveiled \"Amazon Local Register,\" a physical credit card reader that plugs into a smartphone or tablet's headphone jack. Stores using the reader will be able to use the same payment-processing system that Amazon uses for its transactions online. Those interested could sign up for the service starting Wednesday. The reader works with about a dozen devices, including Apple's iPhone and iPad, the three most recent models of Samsung's Galaxy S line and Amazon's own Kindle Fire tablets. Support for Amazon's new Fire phone is \"coming soon,\" the company said. Other Android devices may work with the reader, but only a handful are officially supported. The move puts Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post, in direct competition with other card readers such as Square. The introduction of portable card readers has made it easier for small-business merchants, such as those running food stands, kiosks or farmers market stalls, to move beyond cash-only policies. Other companies such as eBay's PayPal division and Intuit have also released their own card readers for small businesses, charging them a per-transaction fee to process the credit card payments. To give itself an edge in the market, Amazon announced that customers who sign up for its reader by the end of October will be charged a lower per-swipe fee - 1.75 percent - to use the device through January 2016. Otherwise, its fees are comparable to those of its competitors. In addition to the reader, Amazon is offering small businesses software that tracks sales, applies discounts and calculates tax and tip.

        "content": " Amazon.com's business tactics and power over the retail and media economy are again under the spotlight with a new dispute spilling into public view, this time with a media powerhouse: Disney. The online retailer reportedly removed pre-orders of DVDs and Blu-ray discs for the Walt Disney Co.'s blockbuster movies \"Captain America: The Winter's Soldier\" and \"Maleficent,\" according to Home Media Magazine. By blocking pre-orders of films as a negotiating tactic, Amazon is flexing its muscle over how much it gets per sale as a distributor of Disney's films and merchandise, analysts say. Amazon has used a similar approach with Time Warner's home video division this year, blocking pre-orders of discs for films including \"The Lego Movie.\" Amazon and Disney did not return requests for comment. The dispute will not immediately hurt Disney, because DVDs are a small part of its overall revenue, analysts say. But box-office sales have been lackluster and movie studios have placed greater attention on DVD and Blu-ray sales to extend the profits of its films. The pricing dispute comes at a time when media and distribution companies are converging, with Amazon Instant Video serving as both a partner and competitor with Disney and other Hollywood studios. \"I'd say the companies are about as evenly matched as they get, but Amazon may have more leverage as the distributor because it can wait things out longer than Disney,\" said Tuna Amobi, an entertainment and media analyst for S&P Capital IQ. Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post, has demonstrated great determination in its increasing number of pricing disputes. Its dispute with the book publisher Hachette has only escalated over four months. Over the weekend, 900 authors \u2014 including big names such as Steven King and Suzanne Collins \u2014 signed a petition that ran as a two-page ad in the New York Times. They said Amazon has singled them out for retaliation. Hachette has also accused Amazon of strong-arming the publishing industry with vast dominance in the e-books market. Amazon has tried to keep prices too low, Hachette and many authors say, which has harmed book writers and publishers. Amazon responded with a Web site at  www.readersunited.com , where it defends its practices, saying the \"unjustifiably high\" prices Hachette wants to charge for e-books are not in the interest of consumers. cecilia.kang@washpost.com",

        "name": "Goods delivered by drone in 30 minutes? ",
        "content": " Online retail giant Amazon has teamed with three drone manufacturers to push federal agencies and lawmakers to move forward with regulations for unmanned aerial vehicles. The group's main goal is to urge the government to grant permission to companies to test and operate small commercial drones that weigh less than 55 pounds and fly under 400 feet or above 60,000 feet. The coalition is made up of Amazon's Prime Air unit and drone manufacturers DJI Innovations, Parrot Corp. and 3D Robotics. Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post and associated publications, has expressed interest in starting a service for Amazon.com customers that would deliver packages via small drones in less than 30 minutes. Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, are being used already by some law enforcement agencies to fight fires and photograph accident scenes. The Federal Aviation Administration in 2013 authorized the first commercial flight by a drone chartered by ConocoPhillips to scan the seafloor to survey marine mammals before drilling. But the group wants to expand the ways consumers and private companies can use drones to accomplish a host of other functions. Beyond delivering packages, they could be deployed for such uses as photographing real estate properties, tracking poachers who hunt game illegally and expanding broadband to parts of the world with limited access. \"The possibilities for [unmanned aerial vehicle] use are limitless,\" said lobbyist Michael E. Drobac of the law and lobbying firm Akin Gump, which is representing the group. Drobac and fellow Akin Gump lobbyists Jennifer L. Richter and Gregory S. Walden have been meeting with staff and policymakers in Congress, the FAA, the Federal Communications Commission and the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy. Most drone-related regulations fall under the authority of the FAA, but the FCC would deal with spectrum issues, and the White House's technology policy arm could have a hand in shaping privacy-related rules. The FAA is slated to announce proposed rules for small commercial drones later this year. The agency estimates that by 2018, there could be as many as 7,500 small commercial drones in use in the United States. In 2013, the FAA announced six U.S. sites for drone research and testing in Alaska, North Dakota, Nevada, New York, Texas and Virginia.

        "name": "One-size-fits-all textbooks don't make sense in the digital age. Here's a better option. ; A nonprofit borrows tricks from Google, Amazon and Netflix to provide a better learning experience. ",
        "content": " For years, high school students have received identical textbooks as their classmates. Even as students have different learning styles and abilities, they are force-fed the same materials. A nonprofit based at Rice University believes we can do better. \"Imagine a digital textbook where because I'm a different person and learn differently, my book is different than your book,\" said Richard Baraniuk, founder of OpenStax, which received a $9 million grant to develop a prototype textbook for AP Biology and high school physics. \"Because I understand things in a different way from you, the book itself should change. It's exploding this whole idea of this paper, canonical textbook and creating something that's much more like a pathway a student explores.\" OpenStax will spend two years developing the personalized, interactive books and then test them on Houston-area students. The idea is to make learning easier, so students can go on to more successful careers and lives. Baraniuk isn't just reproducing physical textbooks on digital devices, a mistake eBook publishers have made. He's fundamentally rethinking what the educational experience should be in a world of digital tools. To do this means involving individuals with skills traditionally left out of the textbook business. Baraniuk is currently hiring cognitive scientists and machine learning experts. \"Education in the future is going to be this type of team enterprise. Certainly there are going to be subject-matter experts and teachers. There are also going to be an increasing number of cognitive science experts and machine learning teachers and practitioners,\" Baraniuk predicts. Baraniuk wants to use the tactics of Google, Netflix and Amazon to deliver a personalized experience. These Web services all rely on complex algorithms to automatically tailor their offerings for customers. Just as Netflix recommends different movies based on your preferences and viewing history, a textbook might present materials at a different pace. The textbook \u2014 which will be housed in the cloud and viewable on a range of digital devices \u2014 will automatically adjust itself thanks to machine learning. As a student learns about a topic, she could be interrupted by brief quizzes that gauge her mastery of the area. Depending on how the student does, the subject could be reinforced with more material. Or a teacher could be automatically e-mailed that the student is struggling with a certain concept and could use some one-on-one attention. This personalized learning experience is possible thanks to the wealth of data a digital textbook can track. \"You know which page a student is on. You also know as they're scrolling around where they might be within the page,\" Baraniuk said. \"You know when they've clicked on different simulations, practice problems, videos, etc. You have a sense of whether they're playing those videos through to the end, going back to review material.\" Baraniuk also envisions using this data to better track students' progress throughout a course. Parents and teachers can monitor a student's development and chime in with more fitting assistance. His research on his own students at Rice has convinced him of the power of information presentation on how well a student learns. Baraniuk found that when he began spacing out homework on given lessons throughout a semester, his students' grades improved by between a half and full grade point. Rather than cramming \u2014 where what is learned is quickly forgotten \u2014 the extended approach to learning created superior recall. The books will go through a peer-reviewed vetting process similar to traditional textbooks, Baraniuk said. He expects 60 people to review each book before publication to ensure its quality. Given the wealth of data and personalization that digital learning experiences can provide, it's reasonable to expect students' achievement levels to leap forward thanks to the digital age. With personalized learning methods, our students' talents will be better developed. It's an exciting possibility, and let's hope more attention goes to reinventing the textbook. Paper textbooks got a lot of us through school successfully, but now something even better is possible.",

        "name": "Amazon's new attack on Hachette touts the benefits of cheaper e-books ; The online retailer wants to lower e-book prices -- a move it claims will benefit the entire publishing industry. ",
        "content": " Amazon.com has finally laid out the reasons behind its months-long e-book dispute with Hachette Book Group, arguing that it is advocating for a new pricing and revenue sharing plan that will ultimately boost book sales, lower prices and benefit the entire publishing industry. The spat has prompted Amazon to delay the shipment of some books published by Hachette to customers and has also prevented readers from pre-ordering some books. But, until now, neither Amazon nor Hachette had spelled out exactly what the two companies were fighting over. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) In a post on its company's forums Tuesday, Amazon said that it would like to see most e-books priced at $9.99, rather than the common $14.99 or $19.99 prices that publishers set for digital copies of their books. Amazon argued that while it doesn't want every e-book to be set at $9.99, using that price for the majority of digital books would benefit customers, publishers and Amazon itself. Lowering prices by roughly one-third, Amazon said, would encourage customers to buy more books, therefore increasing the size of the e-book market overall. According to its own number-crunching, the company said that the lower price could improve book sales on Amazon by 74 percent. For instance, said Amazon, an e-book that would sell 100,000 copies at $14.99 would be poised to sell 174,000 copies with a $9.99 price tag. Overall, the company said, revenue would actually go up, roughly 16 percent. \"At $9.99, even though the customer is paying less, the total pie is bigger and there is more to share amongst the parties,\" the company said in the post. The online retailer has advocated setting e-book prices at $9.99 before. In fact, a similar plan from Amazon is what prompted Apple to reach out to book publishers in 2008 about what it called \"the $9.99 problem\" -- discussions that eventually drew the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice. Apple and five major book publishers were charged with colluding to raise e-book prices in 2012. All the publishers, including Hachette, settled out of court without admitting wrongdoing. Apple has appealed that decision, and the case is pending. Amazon alluded to that history in its Tuesday post, saying, \"the 30% share of total revenue is what Hachette forced us to take in 2010 when they illegally colluded with their competitors to raise e-book prices. We had no problem with the 30% -- we did have a big problem with the price increases.\" Hachette Book Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon also laid out how it believes revenues from e-book sales should be divided: It would like to keep 30 percent of e-book revenues, and the remaining 70 percent would go to Hachette -- a take that Amazon said it would like to see the group share evenly with authors. Authors affected by the fight between Amazon and Hachette have been outspoken on both sides of the issue, though the majority have said that dragging out the dispute hurts the industry overall.

        "content": " Amazon now has the same \"How to use chopsticks\" video that gained more than 60,000 views on YouTube. But what's different about watching this tutorial video on Amazon is that, next to the video, you can browse 55 items related to the video you just watched, including chopsticks and sushi-making tools, which are available to purchase on Amazon.com. That's the general idea behind Amazon's Video Shorts site, quietly launched as a new part to its existing Instant Video Web site. According to a Amazon spokesperson, the Video Shorts destination within Amazon's Instant Video was added within the past couple weeks. The content previously surfaced only within relevant search results. The site features free short video clips including movie and game trailers, music videos, concert clips, author interviews, how-to tutorial videos for beauty, food and technology, all framed by relevant products available to buy on Amazon. So it's like Amazon meets YouTube. Like YouTube, the Video Shorts content has run-time, a short description and a comments and review section. Unlike YouTube, most videos on Amazon's site seem to be produced by companies rather than individuals. The Amazon spokesperson said the company is working with a variety of content partners on video licensing, but refused to provide any specific details. Although Amazon's new video section looks like a rival to many free-video Web sites, the company seems more interested in promoting the platform itself than any specific brand or company. Currently the site features videos from Howcast, Vox Media, Universal, Sony, Disney and others. But as Mashable pointed out, users can't click on the name of the channel to see all the videos uploaded by that company, which is \"an odd choice that could be a mere oversight or indicate that Amazon is more interested in promoting the platform over any one brand.\" Amazon didn't respond to the request for more details except to say that \"our focus has been (and remains) focused on growing our content selection for customers.\" Amazon may still have a long way to go to make its video business a rival to Google's YouTube, but the company had been ambitious in expanding its e-commerce sales and growing into new areas, from introducing its own smartphone Fire to announcing its 3D printing business which makes it possible for consumers to buy a 3D-printed coffee cup or bubble-heads. \"The company's ambitions are seemingly boundless, with investments in everything from cloud infrastructure and services to mobile devices and consumer hardware. The company wants to deliver groceries to your door, ship its products via drone, stream media to all your screens, and even produce its own TV shows and games,\" Sarah Perez, wrote in TechCrunch. \"It shouldn't then come as any surprise that Amazon would also see its Instant Video Service as something that could not only take on iTunes and Netflix, but potentially YouTube as well\u2026at least, one day.\" The Seattle-based e-commerce retailer posted a $19.3 billion revenue for the second quarter of 2014, a 23 percent rise from $15.7 billion in the same quarter last year.

        "content": " Amazon announced Monday that it's adding a section devoted to 3D printing to its store, which could make the technology more accessible to the average consumer. The ultimate promise of 3D printing is that consumers will be able to get whatever they want at the very moment they want it. Broke your coffee cup? Just fire up your printer, maybe download a blueprint, and get cracking. But there are still plenty of average consumers who may not want to invest in a mini-manufacturing hub for their living room. Where the technology has had the most potential so far has been for small businesses that use the printers to make small runs of super-customizable goods. Sites such as Etsy, for example, have thousands of 3D-printed products for sale -- aimed at people who may not want their own 3D printer but like the idea of being able to design their own goods without breaking the bank. That's exactly the market that Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey Bezos owns The Washington Post, appears to be targeting now. \"The introduction of our 3D Printed Products store suggests the beginnings of a shift in online retail - that manufacturing can be more nimble to provide an immersive customer experience. Sellers, in alignment with designers and manufacturers, can offer more dynamic inventory for customers to personalize and truly make their own,\" said Petra Schindler-Carter, director for Amazon Marketplace Sales, in a statement. The 3D printing store looks a lot like the smaller storefronts Amazon has launched to promote new product trends, most notably the section for wearable tech that the company began promoting this past spring. As with the wearables section, the 3D printing store is starting small. According to the release, there are around 200 goods in the on offer, such as pieces of jewelry, cellphone cases and toys. Some sellers offer more design options than others. In some cases, you may just have a lot of color options for a pair of earrings, very similar to the customization options you'd see in the normal jewelry section. Other goods, such as the custom bobbleheads on offer from Mixee, give you a wider range of design choices to allow you to make dolls that look like you or your friends. Amazon said in the release that it plans to continue expanding the store over time, and even included a link to the application to become a seller.",

        "content": " NEW YORK - Investors got some bad news about the U.S. shopper Friday, driving down stocks and sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a loss for the week. Two major U.S. companies - retail giant Amazon.com and credit card processor Visa - said the second half of the year was looking more troubled than originally expected. The cautious outlook from two companies so heavily exposed to consumer spending spooked investors, causing the stock market to fall at the open and remain lower throughout the day. \"Visa put a lot of caution into the market this morning,\" said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. The Dow dropped 123.23 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,960.57. It's the first time the Dow has closed below the psychologically notable 17,000-point mark since July 9. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.64 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1978.34, and the Nasdaq composite fell 22.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4449.56. With Friday's selling, the Dow fell 0.8 percent this week. The S&P 500 closed basically unchanged, and the Nasdaq rose 0.4 percent this week. Visa was the biggest decliner among the blue chips, falling $7.97, or 3.6 percent, to $214.77. The credit card processor reported an 11 percent rise in quarterly profit but cut its full-year forecast on concerns about growth overseas. Because the Dow is a price-weighted index, and Visa is the most expensive stock in the Dow, Visa was having an outsized impact on it. About 60 points of the Dow's decline can be attributed to Visa. Amazon's quarterly results didn't help boost investor sentiment, either. Amazon's stock slumped nearly 10 percent after the online retail giant late Thursday posted a much wider loss than analysts had forecast, hit by expenses. The Seattle-based company is focused on spending the money it makes to expand into new areas and products, including a smartphone, the Fire, which started selling Friday. Chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post. Amazon fell $34.60 to close at $324.01, the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index. Investors retreated from riskier stocks and moved into traditional havens at times of uncertainty: bonds and gold. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note eased to 2.46 percent from 2.50 percent late Thursday as demand for the government bond rose. Gold climbed $12.60, or 1 percent, to $1,305.30 an ounce. Despite the disappointing news from the consumer-focused companies, corporate earnings from the latest quarter have been solid. Of the 230 companies that have reported, 76 percent have beaten profit expectations and 67 percent have beaten sales expectations, according to FactSet. WP20140726markets0726",

        "content": " Trips to Seattle should probably come with a warning: Caution, drones in use. On Thursday night, security guards at the Seattle Space Needle called city police after tourists reported a drone buzzing outside the window of the attraction's observation deck -- a full 520 feet in the air. They claimed the drone crashed into the observation deck window. The white, camera-equipped, four-propeller device then glided back into the fifth floor window of a nearby hotel. When police caught up with the drone's owner, it turned out to be an Amazon employee who eagerly showed them video of the drone's flight, which didn't indicate that it had struck the Needle during its journey, according to a Seattle Police Department blog post. And, no, this wasn't a test-drive of Prime Air, which Amazon (whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post) recently announced it's working to develop. If the Federal Aviation Administration plays along -- and so far, it hasn't -- drone delivery service could offer same-day, human-free delivery to your front door. Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered, has had a spate of drone-related incidents in recent months. Collectively, they suggest that the general population isn't quite ready for the drone-powered future. Police say the Amazon employee (whose identity wasn't disclosed) has agreed to abide by Seattle's drone regulations and will no longer fly the drone in public. The Space Needle folks, by the way, couldn't resist cracking a joke about the situation: @SeattlePD We are...but still waiting for our @amazon package to arrive",

The company's two biggest expenses last quarter were shipping and the cost of acquiring content such as the TV shows that it streams to Prime members. The amount Amazon spent fulfilling retail orders rose 27 percent over the last year to $2.3 billion in the most recent quarter. It spent another $2.2 billion on \"technology and content\" this past quarter, up from $1.59 billion in the same period last year. The company buys the rights to a massive amount of TV shows and movies in order to drive consumers to its Prime service and to pick up Amazon devices such as its Kindle tablets and new Fire phone. Total media sales, which includes books and digital movies, reached $2.46 billion. Bezos has long said he's not concerned about quarterly results, saying instead that he's focused on long-term rewards. \"We want to make money when people use our devices, not when they buy our devices,\" he said at a 2012 product launch.

        "content": " Recall expenses chopped $1.5\u2020\u2021billion from General Motors' bottom line in the second quarter, as the company added up the costs of repairs for nearly 30 million cars and set aside funds to compensate victims of small-car crashes. The nation's biggest automaker posted a net profit of $190 million (11 cents per share). A year ago, GM made $1.26 billion (75 cents). Without one-time items, GM would have made 58 cents per share, equaling Wall Street's expectations, according to data provider FactSet. GM has recalled almost 30 million vehicles this year, surpassing the company's annual record of 11.8 million in 2004. GM has announced 60 recalls in 2014. The company's safety problems began earlier this year with the recall of 2.6 million small cars with faulty ignition switches linked to at least 13 deaths. GM set aside $400 million to fund a compensation plan for families of those killed and people injured in crashes caused by the switches. Amazon shares fell in after-hours trading after the company reported losing $126 million in its second quarter, the Web retailer's biggest loss since 2012.

This quarter, the company launched several new services and entered the smartphone market with the Amazon Fire Phone. Sales at the mega-retailer reached $19.34 billion, up 23 percent compared with the comparable period last year. But with a loss of 27 cents per share, as opposed to analyst estimates of a 15-cents-per share loss, some investors appear to be running out of patience. The stock was down about 10 percent in after-hours trading from its closing price of $358.61. In an earnings release, Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, highlighted several investments that the company made to improve customer service, which is unsurprising given that one of Bezos's guiding principles is \"customer obsession.\" \"We continue working hard on making the customer experience better and better,\" he said in a statement, listing initiatives such as the addition of Sunday delivery coverage to 25 percent of the United States, the Prime Music streaming service, the development of several original video series and the Kindle Unlimited reading program, which allows people to get unlimited e-books for $9.99 per month. l Morgan Stanley has agreed to pay $275 million to settle U.S. civil charges that it misled investors about risky mortgage bonds it sold ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlement with the Wall Street bank. The SEC said Morgan Stanley failed to accurately disclose the delinquency status of home mortgages backing two securities deals that it financed and sold in 2007. The mortgages underlying the securities had a total value of about $2.5 billion, according to the SEC. l Sales of new U.S. homes plunged 8.1 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 406,000, the Commerce Department said. The report also revised down the May sales rate, to 442,000 from 504,000. New-home purchases fell 20 percent in the Northeast, followed by less extreme declines in the Midwest, South and West. l Ford Motor beat Wall Street's expectations in the second quarter as it chalked up a record profit in North America and made money in Europe for the first time in three years. For the April-June period, Ford's net income rose 6 percent, to $1.3 billion, and revenue fell 1 percent, to $37.4 billion, but topped analysts' expectation.

        "content": " The Fire Phone hits the AT&T network Thursday. It is Amazon's first foray into the smartphone world and a particularly clear articulation of how chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos thinks Amazon should fit into its customers' daily lives. Which is to say, in every possible way. There's no denying that this is, whole hog, an Amazon phone - and in a very personal way. Information about my latest Amazon order was immediately accessible, with a flick of the wrist. So, too, were recommendations for books, movies and music that I might like based on things I've bought in my decade or so as an Amazon customer. The phone also comes with a free year of Amazon's $99 Prime subscription, which gives users access to unlimited streaming video, streaming music and two-day shipping at no extra cost. Recent apps, books or movies you use show up in the \"carousel\" feature - a menu of large icons that act as shortcuts to the latest things you've opened - along with suggestions of what to buy. Users have the option to turn off the recommendations. You can also remove carousel items if it starts feeling cluttered. As a tie-in to Amazon, then, the Fire Phone has no parallel. But as a phone? The story gets a bit more complicated. In many ways, it is a good piece of hardware. Its 4.7-inch screen is great for video without being so big that it stretches your hands. It's dense, but not heavy, and feels like a premium product. The phone's battery life is a bit short - I had to recharge in the course of a normal day of use - so users will have to keep a cord handy. The screen is a main selling point, ably showing off high-quality, streaming video and visual effects such as \"Dynamic Perspective\" - a feature where apps respond based on the way you hold the phone relative to your head. In apps that use Dynamic Perspective, images shift as you tilt your head. In many of Amazon's own apps, slightly tilting the phone away from you will also bring up little pieces of information, similar to mouse-over text on a Web site. Far and away, the best feature of the phone is the amount of memory it has. The Fire Phone comes in two basic models: one with 32 gigabytes of memory, and one with 64GB, as opposed to the iPhone, which starts with 16GB at the low end. The review unit provided by AT&T to The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon chief executive Bezos, was the smaller of the two, but it still left me with plenty of room for downloading videos, music, apps and books. That makes sense, considering all of the media that Amazon wants you to put on the phone. The device's storage comes in addition to unlimited cloud storage for any photos you take on the Fire Phone's 13-megapixel camera. That camera also acts as your main portal to commerce, by way of the \"Firefly\" text and product recognition feature, which allows users to scan book covers and bar codes. Users can activate Firefly by holding down the dedicated camera button on the side of the phone. Firefly is the sort of feature that seems useful but needs to be assessed over a longer period of time. It was also nice to be able to call up the feature to pull phone numbers and e-mail addresses from printed material with reasonable accuracy - my name isn't \"Tsukoyama,\" but it's close. Even at my desk, Firefly was able to identify several items simply by scanning their bar codes, which in turn called up a product listing on Amazon. Not every product gets recognized every time, making it more of a neat trick than an indispensable tool, for now. Many other software features had that same feel of being cool ideas that needed a few more rounds of testing to be ready for prime time. The look of the menus can be a bit jarring - ugly, even. And the basic navigation design of the phone's operating system was still a little rough around the edges. Users tilt the phone to access menus on the left and right sides of the phone, but sometimes the movement didn't trigger the menus. Other times it required a movement so sharp that it felt the phone could have flown out of my hand. Finally, I had trouble getting Amazon's instant customer service feature, Mayday, to fire up consistently due to a weak WiFi or cellular signal. But it works well when you can connect, and the on-call staff responds promptly to questions. It's a feature that would be particularly useful if the Fire Phone were aimed at people buying their first smartphones. All in all, the Fire Phone is a good device that needs another layer of polish. There are a lot of elements here that are promising. But there's room to improve, and the phone is a little too rough to recommend to anyone who isn't a die-hard Amazon shopper. WP20140724fire0724",

        "name": "Is Kindle Unlimited worth it? ",
        "content": " Amazon.com introduced a new subscription service, Kindle Unlimited, on Friday. This $9.99 per month, all-you-can-eat feature gives you full access to a hundreds of thousands of e-books. Bookworms, wipe your mouths; that drooling is unsightly. But before you run out and sign up for the free trial, here are some things to consider before you make your decision. How many books do you read per year? Kindle Unlimited is $9.99 per month. So you'll be paying Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey Bezos owns The Washington Post, around $120 per year for the unfettered e-book access. If you're habitually spending money on more than one book per month, then it's a service to think about. It has its perks for big book buyers -- namely that don't have to worry about spending money on a book you end up hating. But, chances are, you aren't reading more than one book per month. In January, the Pew Internet and American Life Project asked how many books the typical American had read in the past year. The answer? Five. There's no judgment here. Books take time to consume--and require undivided attention. (Even is tough.) But just remember that if you're not one of those folks reading at least 13 books a year, then a $10 per month book service is probably not a top priority. Is there another service that could be a better fit? Part of what makes Amazon's service so appealing is the fact they're offering you access to a catalog of 600,000 e-books. But that doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be able to read any book that you want. Amazon's Kindle Unlimited catalog is heavy on classics, famous series such as \"Harry Potter\" or \"Lord of the Rings\" and, of course, the books that authors self-publish on Amazon. But if you want any of the top five current New York Times fiction bestsellers, for example, you're not going to find them in the Unlimited catalog. (They're on Amazon, just not as a part of the Kindle Unlimited pool.) I recently did a rundown of other companies that are trying to be the \"Netflix for books,\" before this announcement. What I found is that no book subscription service has everything you want to read. Oyster, for example, has access to a lot of the back-catalogues of publishers big and small, but not many bestsellers. Scribd has a great selection of quicker reads, thanks to a broad selection of documents, poetry and short stories. And Entitle, another type of books subscription service, does have bestsellers from Simon & Schuster and HarperCollins -- but there's a limit to how many books you can buy per month. Basically, the service that fits you best is the one that matches up with your reading list. If you have to read the latest novel now, having a Kindle Unlimited subscription won't help you. How does this fit in with my Prime subscription? It doesn't. Prime members -- who already pay $99 per year to Amazon for two-day shipping, streaming music, streaming video and a limited number of e-books at no extra cost -- don't get any extra perks here. Amazon has launched this as a separate service. Sorry. What about Audible? Kindle Unlimited does pose some interesting possibilities for subscribers to Audible, Amazon's audiobook service. The service includes some unlimited access to narrated books, or e-books that come with audio tracks. Amazon already offers a lot of e-books that will sync with the title's corresponding audiobook. It's convenient, actually, for when you're trying to get through a book and multitask--read some in bed and then pick up some more while you're doing chores around the house. At the same time, not everyone wants to pay twice for the same book. Kindle Unlimited solves that particular problem, but trading your Audible membership for a Kindle Unlimited membership also means giving up a big chunk of the current Audible library. There are around 2,000 books with audio tracks on Kindle Unlimited right now. Audible boasts over 150,000 titles. If you can't decide whether you should give up your Audible membership for a Kindle Unlimited sign-up, Amazon isn't making you choose just yet. Kindle Unlimited comes with a free three-month subscription to Audible.",

        "content": " Amazon has just announced that it's unveiling a monthly subscription service that'll let you read as many e-books as you want. The service, called Kindle Unlimited, gives customers access to Amazon's catalog of 600,000 Kindle books and \"thousands\" of audio books. Here's how it'll work: For a monthly fee of $9.99, Kindle users can browse the Amazon bookstore and wherever they see the logo for Kindle Unlimited, they'll be able to download the title for free. Decide you don't like a book halfway through? Pick another one. The business model should look familiar to anyone who's binged on \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange is the New Black.\" But it's now being applied to a very different industry. And if it takes off, Amazon would be the perfect company to extend it to even more retail sectors. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.) All this is happening against the backdrop of a larger struggle between Amazon and publishers, who disagree over how much Amazon should pay its suppliers for e-books. Question is, will Kindle Unlimited drive e-book prices even lower? Or could this alternative help drive more money to companies like Hachette? To understand what might happen, we have to look at how the revenues are determined. Typically, once a subscriber has read a certain percentage of a given book, it's considered a \"sale,\" and the company that runs the subscription pays the publisher for it \u2014 at retail prices, not wholesale, according to Robert Gottlieb, chairman of the Trident Media Group. \"That percentage can be anywhere from 20 percent to 25 percent,\" said Gottlieb. That the retailer pays a slightly higher price for the books could be a boon to authors and publishers. But it could undermine the trade paperback business, Gottlieb added. That's because books from services like Amazon Unlimited are typically older titles. If people begin reading more of those on their e-readers, the industry that produces paperback reprints of hardcover books could suffer. The e-book subscription space is already pretty crowded; my colleague Hayley Tsukayama reviewed three other services here. With Amazon now joining, it'll be a surprise if it doesn't wind up dominating the business over time. Amazon's sheer size means that, just as with the normal e-book business, it'll have a lot of power to set that percentage that determines when a book has been \"sold.\" \"Amazon can leverage whatever percentage they want,\" said Gottlieb. \"They can say, 'We're not going to take your books if you don't do this.'\" Could Kindle Unlimited have been a factor in the ongoing dispute between Amazon and Hachette? It's unlikely; the disagreement has more to do with how to sell books that are just coming on the market, rather than how to sell books that have already been available for a year or more. A Hachette spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. One other advantage Amazon has over other e-book subscription services? It's got its hands in so many other industries that it could easily export it to other areas of its business. Have more to say about this topic?

        "content": " Federal regulators announced Thursday it has filed a lawsuit against Amazon.com for allegedly making it too easy for children to make purchases when using mobile apps without a parent's permission. The Federal Trade Commission said Amazon charged parents millions of dollars of unauthorized payments for what's known as \"in-app purchases,\" typically make-believe items popularly offered within mobile games such as Candy Crush Saga that enhance a game or allow a user to advance levels. The FTC said in its suit that it seeks a court order for the company to refund families affected by the unauthorized charges that began in 2011. It also wants the court to permanently ban Amazon from charging parents for in-app purchases without their consent. Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC alleges that beginning in November 2011, Amazon violated the FTC Act by billing parents for charges incurred by their children without permission. Amazon's Kindle Fire tablet was used by children to play games and spend \"unlimited amounts of money\" to pay for virtual items within the apps such as \"coins,\" \"stars,\" and \"acorns\" without parental involvement, the agency wrote in a release. The FTC said that at first, no password requirements were put in place to stop children from making the purchases. \"Amazon's in-app system allowed children to incur unlimited charges on their parents' accounts without permission,\" said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez. \"Even Amazon's own employees recognized the serious problem its process created. We are seeking refunds for affected parents and a court order to ensure that Amazon gets parents' consent for in-app purchases.\" Just a month after apps were introduced into Amazon's store, internal emails between staff showed the company was concerned about in-app purchases being made without password protection, according to the government. It was \"\u2026clearly causing problems for a large percentage of our customers,\" said an email cited in the FTC's suit. The situation, according to the Amazon email, was a \"near house on fire.\" The FTC said thousands of parents complained to Amazon about charges made by children through in-app purchases. The company changed its policy in 2012, requiring passwords for purchases over $20. Still, complaints piled up, according to the FTC suit. In 2013, it required greater password protections but still allowed for a 15-minute window for unlimited purchases after an authorizing password was used. It took the FTC's lawsuit, approved last month, for Amazon to further strengthen its in-app purchases policy for newer devices, the FTC said. Lawmakers and child development experts have criticized in-app purchases in child-oriented apps because children often don't realize they are making real purchases for items such as gold coins that ultimately show up on their parent's bills. In the game Ice Age Village, for instance, gold coins and acorns can be purchased for as much as $99 per item. One mother complained to Amazon of $358.42 in unauthorized charges, according to the FTC; some parents complained to the company that children who could not read were able to \"click a lot of buttons at random\" and rack up charges. The Federal Trade Commission's suit comes after months of talks with Amazon about the company's policy for in-app purchases. The FTC asked for the Seattle retailing and tech giant to abide by guidelines the agency has put forward for rival Apple, which settled FTC charges along these lines earlier this year. According to reports, Amazon defends its practices and said it shouldn't be held by the same requirements as Apple. The company has said it prefers to defend its policy for disclosures in court.",

        "content": " Remember how Amazon wants to deliver its packages to you by drone in 30 minutes or less? And remember the federal government's objections to letting those and other commercial drones fly in U.S. airspace? Well, Amazon is hoping to get around those. So it's filed a petition with the Federal Aviation Administration asking for an exemption. In a filing to the agency this week, Amazon says that it's made tremendous strides with its drone technology. It's now working on eighth- and ninth-generation copter designs, just three months after the company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, told shareholders Amazon was drawing up plans for its seventh-gen drone. (Bezos is also the owner of The Washington Post.) Other details appear in the filing that the company hasn't disclosed before: Its drones are capable of flying at 50 miles per hour, for instance. And the team working on them contains \"world\u2010renowned roboticists, scientists, aeronautical engineers, remote sensing experts and a former NASA astronaut.\" But the bulk of the filing is devoted to Amazon's main purpose, which is two-fold: To get permission from the FAA to put its drones in the air, and to be able to test them at its own research facilities in Washington state rather than having to visit one of the six test sites that the agency approved late last year. Amazon says it's willing to take extra safety precautions, such as flying no higher than 400 feet above ground level, keeping the drone within visual range and readying a \"physical button\" that can cut power to the machine if something goes wrong. \"We're continuing to work with the FAA to meet Congress's goal of getting drones flying commercially in America safely and soon,\" said Paul Misener, Amazon's vice president of global public policy. \"We want to do more R&D close to home.\" Testing the drones right where they're designed would save the company time \u2014 while conveniently shielding the machines from public view. Amazon's petition comes a week after the Motion Picture Association of America made its own request to the FAA for a special pass, and a month before the agency is supposed to publish new rules allowing lightweight commercial drones into U.S. airspace. Few expect the FAA to meet the deadline. The agency's sluggishness to develop regulations has raised questions about whether the United States is lagging behind in the civil and commercial drone industries. Other countries where drone policy isn't as strict have seen a surge of economic activity surrounding the technology. Amazon's filing to the FAA alludes to the international draw. \"Because Amazon is a commercial enterprise we have been limited to conducting R&D flights indoors or in other countries,\" the proposal reads. \"Of course, Amazon would prefer to keep the focus, jobs and investment of this important research and development initiative in the United States.\" If the petition is rejected, well\u2026 draw your own conclusions.

        "name": "Author's Guild president to Amazon: No, thanks. We don't want your money. ; The president of the Authors Guild, which represents about 9,000 writers, said she doesn't think Amazon's proposal on e-books benefits authors -- or the industry -- in the long-term. ",
        "content": " The contract dispute between Amazon.com and Hachette Book Group has delayed the shipment of thousands of titles. The battle took another turn this week as Amazon reached out to Hachette authors with an offer to immediately begin offering the delayed books again and give its share of Hachette digital book sales to the authors for the duration of the dispute -- if the publisher would also forgo its share of the revenue. What do authors think? Authors Guild president Roxana Robinson isn't buying it, saying the offer is merely a tactic to bully the publisher into conceding to unfavorable terms. When presented with that argument, Amazon said in a statement late Wednesday that writers against the deal, such as Robinson, are \"conflating the long-term structure of the industry with a short-term proposal designed to take authors...out of the line of fire.\" \"Given her position as the head of an author's advocacy group, it is hard to believe she could be against such an offer,\" the company said of Robinson. \"She's the leader of the Authors Guild, not the Publishers Guild.\" This is not the first time that the guild, which represents about 9,000 writers, has found itself at odds with Amazon and other tech giants over moves to take books into the digital age. The group has also been critical of publishers, saying that those companies \"regularly put the squeeze\" on their authors when discussing e-book royalty rates. It's also worth noting that there are a number of self-published authors who've welcomed Amazon's rise in the e-book industry -- including several who circulated a petition in support of Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post. Robinson took some time Wednesday to chat by phone with The Washington Post about the guild's position on the offer from Amazon. The following has been edited for length and clarity. What's your reaction to this Amazon proposal? Generally speaking, I think that authors are still stuck in the middle of this, which is disheartening because we supply the product. We supply the books, which both Amazon and the publishing houses need. The Amazon letter didn't really take us out of the middle; it asked us to take sides against our publishers. It also seems to assume that what we really want is a short-term windfall, which is what we get if Amazon asked Hachette to give up revenues from e-books. But we want a healthy publishing ecosystem, a system of commerce in which we're not trying to kill each other or drive each other out of business. What would that system look like? I think, at the moment, that because Amazon has such a huge share of the market, it would be great if there was some other force brought to bear on it to break it up. Do you mean government intervention? Having the government step in would be one way. I don't know the legal definition of a monopoly, but when a single company has so much power, that would be a situation in which legal intervention would make sense. Or another thing is that when a company is larger than a certain size, there can be moves internally to break them up. Or to change things when a company dominates the marketing of the product and is trying to take over the whole branch of the industry. One interesting thing that happened yesterday is that HarperCollins is starting to sell directly. So consumers no longer need to go to Amazon. That would be a way to change this. Amazon says that their proposal is of particular benefit to mid-list authors; do you foresee a schism? If they really wanted to benefit mid-list authors, they could have refrained from taking them off the site in the first place. Or they could have offered single-handedly to give up its revenues from e-books. That letter suggests Hachette will be giving up something without asking Hachette first. We don't know what the terms are between Hachette and Amazon. It's a complicated offer that [Amazon is] making, and it's not as simple as they would like to make it seem. I've been in touch with other people at the Authors Guild. We're trying to represent everyone, which includes those authors who are self-published and trying to protect them as well. And we're looking toward the long-term; we want the best arrangement possible for writers in the future. What do you think the best arrangement would be? We don't know what Amazon's plans are. I understand why people would go to Amazon, and accept this deal. The terms are very welcoming. But we don't know what the terms would be like in the long-term. The sense that we have is that Amazon is pursuing every one of their partners. And at a certain point, squeezing the supplier is no longer sustainable. Amazon's response is they [Hachette] can afford this; that's not a constructive attitude toward a partner that you want to be vital, energetic and healthy. It would be better for all of us if we all agree that everyone should have enough profit. We shouldn't go after every cent that we can take out of everyone else's hide.",

        "name": "Amazon makes an offer to Hachette authors ",
        "content": " Amazon.com has an offer for authors at the book publisher Hachette, which is embroiled in a fight with the Internet retailer over e-book prices: Amazon will restore the authors' books to its Web site and give writers all of the revenue from digital sales of their books. \"If Hachette agrees, for as long as this dispute lasts, Hachette authors would get 100 percent of the sales price of every Hachette e-book we sell,\" Amazon said in a letter sent to authors and literary agents. \"Both Amazon and Hachette would forego all revenue and profit from the sale of every e-book until an agreement is reached.\" Hachette confirmed in a statement that Amazon has sent it a brief proposal to this effect, but says the best solution would be to resolve the dispute as quickly as possible. The publisher and Amazon have been fighting over the pricing of e-books and what share each of the firms will get from digital sales. The publisher alleges that the Web retailer is purposefully not delivering Hachette books promptly, even though the titles are in stock and available. \"We invite Amazon to withdraw the sanctions they have unilaterally imposed, and we will continue to negotiate in good faith and with the hope of a swift conclusion,\" the publisher said. But Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post, has made clear that it's ready to play hardball. In a statement Tuesday, the firm referred to earlier comments from the publisher that accepting Amazon's offer would be suicidal. Amazon countered that Hachette would be more than able to afford the sort of deal the retailer proposes. \"We call baloney,\" the Amazon statement said. \"Hachette is part of a $10 billion global conglomerate. It wouldn't be 'suicide.' They can afford it. What they're really making clear is that they absolutely want their authors caught in the middle of this negotiation because they believe it increases their leverage.\" According to Hachette's Web site, the publisher makes approximately 33 percent of its sales from e-books; the New York Times reported that around 60 percent of that business comes through Amazon. A New Yorker report in February estimated that 7 percent of Amazon's revenues come from books. Authors should not have their books held hostage as a bargaining chip, said Robert Gottlieb, chairman of Trident Media Group, a literary agency. \"I feel from an author's standpoint that what matters to them is that their books are available,\" said Gottlieb. And retailers, he said, have the right to conduct business as they see fit. Meanwhile, authors are still weighing the pros and cons of accepting such a deal. Some authors feel that Amazon's proposal is unfair and asks writers to burn bridges with their publishing company. \"They're asking us authors to load Amazon's guns for them,\" said Doug Preston, a best-selling author who had penned a letter asking Amazon to resolve its dispute with Hachette. That letter, which he circulated to other writers, has thus far gathered at least 400 signatures from notable authors such as Stephen King, James Patterson and Robert A. Caro. David Maraniss, an associate editor at The Washington Post, has also signed the letter. Preston, who spoke with Amazon senior vice president of Kindle content Russ Grandinetti over the weekend, said that he wouldn't feel right taking Amazon's proposed deal -- even though he estimates doing so would make him millions of dollars. \"That would be like blood money,\" he said. \"I would never turn around and do something like that to them.\" Best-selling Hachette author Scott Turow called Amazon's offer \"little more than a publicity stunt.\" Turow, a lawyer and former president of the Authors' Guild, said accepting the offer \"would be very shortsighted on the part of authors. If they succeeded by this tactic in making Hachette cave, one of the losers would end up being the authors. Amazon is not offering 100 percent in perpetuity.\" Turow said that \"to some extent the publishers have brought this on themselves by not sharing appropriately with authors. There are much fatter profits on ebooks than on physical ones and that has drawn Amazon like bees to the honey.\" But he added that \"giving more to Amazon is not the solution.\" He said only best-selling authors have the bargaining power to get better royalties from publishers. \"If Amazon really wanted to split authors from the publishers, it would wrap its arms around us and demand higher royalties for authors while not increasing its share of revenues,\" Turow said. Update, July 9: In response to Preston's comments, Amazon said in a statement, \"Easy for him to say. He's rich and already successful. He can opt out of the offer for himself if he wants, but he shouldn't stand in the way of debut and midlist authors benefiting from the offer.\"",

        "content": " The clash between Amazon.com and publishing giant Hachette has taken a new turn, as hundreds of authors asked readers to write e-mails to Amazon's chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos to protest the web retailer's tough tactics. One letter, spearheaded by author Douglas Preston and signed by nearly 400 authors--including Stephen King, Pulitzer Prize winner Robert A. Caro and novelist James Patterson--takes Amazon to task specifically for not accepting pre-orders on Hachette authors' books, not discounting the prices of many Hachette books and slowing the delivery of many Hachette titles to consumers' doorsteps. \"We have made Amazon many millions of dollars and over the years have contributed so much, free of charge, to the company by way of cooperation, joint promotions, reviews and blogs. This is no way to treat a business partner. Nor is it the right way to treat your friends,\" the authors say in their letter. A working draft of the letter provided to The Post is embedded below. Nearly 400 have agreed to sign the letter so far, according to author and lead letter-writer Douglas Preston. Some, but not all, of the authors are published by Hachette. Author letter to Amazon (Work in Progress) In a statement, Amazon said that it regrets that the negotiation dispute has hurt authors. \"Our focus for years has been to build a bookstore that benefits authors and readers alike. We take seriously and regret the impact it has when, however infrequently, a terms dispute with a publisher affects authors,\" said Amazon, whose chief executive Bezos owns The Washington Post, in a statement. \"We look forward to resolving this issue with Hachette as soon as possible.\" Meanwhile, a competing petition posted to Change.org points the finger squarely at publishers for the dispute--and bears the name of 26 authors, many of whom are self-published. Many of those authors note that Amazon's self-publishing platform has given authors a direct way to disseminate their work. New York Publishing once controlled the book industry,\" the petition says. \"They decided which stories you were allowed to read. They decided which authors were allowed to publish. They charged high prices while withholding less expensive formats,\" the petition reads. \"Amazon, in contrast, trusts you to decide what to read, and they strive to keep the price you pay low.\"",

        "name": "This man wants to bring daily deals back from the dead. To which we can only say: Meh. ",
        "content": " Everything that has happened on the Internet in the past five years would suggest that daily-deal sites are, conclusively, dead. Groupon chief executive Andrew Mason was summarily booted from his own company. LivingSocial laid off hundreds of people and watched millions of dollars evaporate. Even the original daily-deal site, Texas-based Woot, was devoured like so much breakfast octopus by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos. And yet \u2014 and yet! \u2014 Matt Rutledge, the man behind Woot, is back with an ambitious plan to restore daily deals to their former glory. Woot, for ye who missed it, was the quirky, irreverent front-runner to modern daily deals, premised on transparency and randomness (\u2026 literally, in some cases, \"random bags of crap\"). In a Kickstarter that was funded Saturday, Rutledge essentially made his pitch to bring it back. There will be no more than one deal a day, he promised. No ads or marketing. And most refreshingly, perhaps, no ambitions to change culture or capitalism or The Way We Shop Now. \"Because even if it turns out to be the greatest store on the Internet,\" Rutledge writes, \"it's still just a store on the Internet.\" \u2026 he is, appropriately, christening the whole thing \"Meh.\" Since Tuesday, more than a thousand people have bought into Rutledge's vision \u2026 or his nostalgia, or his candor, or some combination of the three. When the Kickstarter closed Saturday morning, the project had raised $14,777 instead of the $10,000 it originally sought. This is particularly incredible when you consider what the site promises to do with those funds \u2014 nothing. (If \"we end up netting a bunch of money from\" Kickstarter, the FAQ reads, \"I dunno, maybe we'll commission some famous rock stars to write our site theme song.\" Or something.) No doubt, people throwing money at a start-up on Kickstarter do, in fact, want that start-up to succeed. But given Meh's vague implementation, and the fierce loyalty of comments left by several of its backers, the project's success also looks like a strike for a broader movement: a backlash, if you will, against the super-corporatized, over-marketed and totally invasive culture of modern e-commerce sites. Specifically, it reads like a reaction against Amazon, which bought and partially dismembered Woot in 2010. \"It made me sad that [Amazon] slowly killed everything that made [Woot] special,\" one commenter wrote. \"I'm seriously excited to see that you guys are coming out with a true successor.\" Compared to an amazon like Amazon, Meh does look scrappy and alternative \u2014 a refreshingly human, down-to-earth free-for-all where no one's trying to sell you junk \u2026 or sell you as the product, yourself. The question, of course, is whether that vision can actually compete in the very crowded, very stagnant market of daily deals. \"How come every time something simple gets popular, people want to make it more complicated? And less fun?\" Rutledge asks. Maybe he's forgotten from his pre-windfall days, but there's usually one big reason: the bills.",

        "name": "The banking industry wants to be just like Amazon ",
        "content": " It started out as mild infatuation, but now it seems bankers have developed a full-blown crush on Amazon.com. From Citigroup to SunTrust, banking industry executives are gushing over the Internet retailer's use of analytics to figure out what customers want, a model that bankers see as the salvation for an industry being invaded by more nimble retail, tech and telecom competitors. Just like Amazon, banks collect vast amounts of information about their clients. Your bank knows what you buy, how much you spend and whether you have anything saved. That kind of intel could be used to anticipate whether you need a credit card, car loan or investments. It's one thing to simply offer a car loan, Thong Nguyen, the head of retail banking at Bank of America, said at a press breakfast in Manhattan Thursday. \"It's more interesting to see that you are on month 33 of your car loan payments...and then present you the opportunity to get a cheaper rate,\" Consumers--whether they are buying a Kindle or opening a checking account--want companies to make products relevant to their individual needs, Nguyen said. There is something to be said for getting an email of feminist reading suggestions from Amazon, after you've finished a Bell Hooks book on your Kindle. The banking industry is betting that the same sort of tailor-made approach could work for mortgages and credit cards too. The trick will be to do it without appearing creepy or intrusive. \"We're chasing after the Amazon experience,\" Nguyen said. \"Amazon keeps moving to improve customer service. And we're going to invest more\" to replicate that kind of service. Nguyen said for banks to be successful at data-driven customer service, they would need to drill down into each client profile. The financial needs of a 28 year-old customer making $100,000 a year is not the same as a 63 year old with the same salary. Sure, they're both prime candidates for investment products, but would require a different mix of stocks and bonds. Or they may need different types of home loans. \"The things that we offer you won't change--credit cards, home loans, investments and what not--the way I engage you, make it relevant for you will,\" Nguyen said. This sort of individualized approach runs counter to the traditional banking model that relies heavily on a high volume of transactions. Who has the time to figure out what each customer needs when dealing with millions of accounts? But the entrance of Google, Wal-Mart and even Amazon into the payments space is putting pressure on banks to find new ways to reach and keep customers. Yet if banks use customer data solely for the purpose of selling more products, they may miss an opportunity to develop meaningful relationships, said Jennifer Tescher, president and chief executive of the Center for Financial Services Innovation. \"Banks could make a huge impact by using data to help consumers optimize their cash flow in real time,\" she said. \"Using data to predict a life event that's going to require a high-margin banking product is not the place to start.\" She noted that PNC Bank and KeyBank track their customers' transactions and create a financial calendar that lists when bills are due or money scheduled for deposit, helping people manage their finances. \"Technology should enable us to solve the problem of having to juggle your inflows and outflows, particularly when the timing and the amount of money you have varies dramatically from month to month,\" Tescher said. \"If banks are able to do that, it would be an incredible value to customers.\" It could also help to ease some of the consumer anxiety surrounding mobile banking. The platform is catching on, especially among folks under the age of 35, but a good segment of the population remain distrustful of conducting financial transactions through their smartphones. A recent study by the National Council of La Raza and the Urban League found that nearly a third of the 5,000 people they surveyed were concerned about security controls. Banks and credit unions actually have tougher regulatory standards to guard consumer data than merchants do because of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999. That bit of information, coupled with the promotion of basic money management, could draw even more people to mobile. Nguyen said smartphones are the next frontier. Building out intuitive digital platforms, with the ability to send spending or bill pay alerts, could give customers the same sort of user-friendly experience that has made companies like Amazon popular. About 15 million Bank of America customers use their smartphones to transfer money or deposit checks, a number that Nguyen said has been growing at 20 percent a year. By comparison, the number of customers that bank online--roughly 30 million--has hit a plateau. As a result, Nguyen said Bank of America is investing in its mobile platform, with an aim of someday moving into mobile payments, whereby a merchant can scan a customer's smartphone to collect a payment. \"The next frontier is the payment technology,\" Nguyen said. \" We're going to be working with people who make phones, with people like Google, eBay and Paypal and see where it goes from there. The whole payment system is going to evolve.\"",

        "name": "Apple, Amazon have a dangerous obsession with the tech gadget du jour ",
        "content": " Apple has a new smartwatch coming in the fall and Amazon has a new Fire smartphone coming in July. That should be good news for consumer technology fans, but the reality is that both products are \"me-too\" plays that should be setting off all kinds of warning bells for Silicon Valley watchers. Instead of launching truly innovative new products and opening up entirely new markets, the best and brightest companies are seemingly content to make a more conservative play for market share and rely on incremental innovations to win over customers. Take the Apple \"iWatch,\" for example. Even die-hard Apple fans would have to admit that the iWatch sounds like a \"me-too\" tech play that has the company struggling to catch up with the likes of Samsung. It's almost like Apple is unwillingly being pulled into creating an iWatch just because its top tech rivals also have a smartwatch. True, there's an opportunity to create a market-changing digital fitness product using the iWatch \u2014 but smartwatches have had trouble gaining any traction to date. Or, for example, consider the new Amazon Fire phone. Do we really need another smartphone that helps us buy more products? Amazon's decision to roll out a new smartphone when the entire smartphone industry is nearing its saturation point seems a lot like a lot of reactive strategy. In short, a big company reacts to what's going on around it rather than really mapping out a strategy for the future. Yes, there are some features that sound innovative \u2014 but the bigger picture is that an Amazon smartphone sounds a lot like a Facebook smartphone, and we all know how that did. Not that there aren't some big ideas out there in Silicon Valley. You have Google launching Internet balloons, building a fleet of driverless cars and developing quantum computers. But, oh, by the way, Google's Nest plans to acquire Dropcam for more than half a billion dollars. A company that promises to change the world ends up buying a webcam company. Amazon wowed the world with its delivery drones last year, but followed that up with tepid adventures in innovation such as Fire TV and the Fire phone. No word yet if the Fire smartwatch is next. Facebook has its share of innovative concepts in the works \u2014 like a plan to use satellite drones to provide Internet access to the world \u2014 but on a day-to-day basis, Facebook seems more interested in carrying out little tweaks to its algorithms. Meanwhile the company rolls out ever more apps that seem like \"me-too\" plays in an effort to keep up with innovators around it. The latest is Slingshot, which sounds a lot like Snapchat. Apple has a futuristic new headquarters in the works and a vision to change the way we think about digital health. But it follows that up with the so-called iWatch \u2014 a smartwatch that reportedly comes in a variety of screen sizes and colors along with sensors for tracking health. The problem, quite simply, is that the recent moves by the likes of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google actually make too much sense. From a purely business and analytical perspective, the moves are designed to maximize market share, increase user engagement, and hit any of the various other metrics designed to measure their performance. Wall Street analysts, even if they're not in love with the moves, have to respect them. If the Amazon Fire phone succeeds in signing more people up for Amazon Prime and selling an incremental number of products on Amazon, does it really matter that the phone never acquires the market cachet of an iPhone? Follow the arc of the rise and fall of any industry leader, however, and that's exactly how smaller companies with inferior technologies begin to chip away at the market leaders. As Clayton Christensen has pointed out in The Innovator's Dilemma \u2014 still one of the classic innovation reads \u2014 what makes true innovation so hard is that the business case for \"business as usual\" just makes so much sense once you're the market leader. It becomes a matter of continual improvements and tweaks to \"what works,\" while ceding the ground to upstarts when it comes to new technologies. So here's why the infatuation with the latest product du jour is so dangerous \u2014 in the pursuit of incremental gains to quarterly financial numbers, America's most innovative companies risk ceding more and more ground to upstarts who are coming up with disruptive products. It almost seems impossible to think of a company more innovative than Google or Apple these days \u2014 but the same was once surely true of great American companies such as IBM or Kodak. When the best and brightest in Silicon Valley are buying the likes of Nest or Beats, one wonders if they are doing so because they are one step ahead of the curve \u2014 or one step behind.",

        "content": " The federal government and nonprofits are gradually getting more comfortable with Internet cloud services, Amazon Web Service's vice president of global public sector said on Wednesday. During AWS's annual symposium this week in Washington \u2014 aimed at attracting public sector and nonprofit customers \u2014 Carlson said she noticed organizations today using cloud services for more than just basic storage. Some are also using cloud services to help build completely new applications, she said. \"In the early days of talking with a customer, they weren't sure where to begin. Now they have a vision, they have a plan,\" she said. The symposium drew more executives this year compared to past years, she said \u2014 a sign that the people responsible for organizations' missions are now eager to learn about cloud applications, instead of just developers. In March, the company secured an authority to operate certain cloud services with the Defense Department. AWS secured FedRAMP certification \u2014 a federal security requirement\u2014 since May of 2013. Despite growing cloud adoption, there's still work to be done, she said. \"We're far from done,\" she said. \"There's still agencies [that] don't have all [the] steps in place, so we're still working with agencies and a lot of countries around the world\" to help them understand how to acquire cloud services. To speed adoption, AWS spends plenty of time on Capitol Hill educating lawmakers about the cost-saving potential of cloud services, Carlson said \u2014 especially as compared to traditional data storage. The company has been marketing its services not only to federal governments for their internal use, but more recently, to state and local governments that might use Amazon's cloud services to build applications that would help them connect with citizens, she said. \"We also spend time on compliance and the security regime with compliance officers within those agencies,\" Carlson added. The federal government is also adapting to the culture of cloud computing \u2014 especially the rapid process of so-called agile software development, where product improvements are made incrementally. \"I think people are beginning to realize that on AWS you can try and fail fast without it affecting your system in a big way. Try things out in a testing and developing environment before you start deploying completely, and that's really another benefit of true commercial cloud computing, is their ability to try these architectures out and fail really fast, and cheap, without having it really affect their application that's up and running.\" (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P.

        "content": " Google will debut \"at least one\" new television set-top box and compatible software on Wednesday when its developer conference kicks off in San Francisco, according to several news outlets. The box will allow users to view content, listen to music and play games on their TV sets, according to stories in the Wall Street Journal and CNET. The search engine giant is in a race with Amazon, Apple and others to lure users with devices that favor their content and services. In Google's case, such devices also multiply the company's opportunities to run targeted ads, its primary revenue stream. (Disclosure: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) According to the Journal, the device itself is made by another company but uses Google's new Android TV software designed to play movies, games and other content on televisions. Users will be able to use Android phones, tablets and potentially other devices as remote controls. A key feature of Android TV will be videogames that work seamlessly between mobile devices and TV, a developer briefed on Google's plans told the Journal. That means users could play a game on the bus on the way to work, then pick up where they left off on their Android-powered TV when they get home. Another source said a split-screen multiplayer game is in development. According to CNET, at least one Google device unveiled on Wednesday will have a Nvidia Tegra 4 processor, with other boxes using Intel processors in the works. The Tegra 4 is the same chip used in Nvidia's Shield, an Android-based handheld video game released last year. Google TV has been available through devices made by LG, Netgear, Vizio and other companies since 2010, but many Android partners use their own software to power the devices. The company's previous forays into the TV market have flopped. Former partner Logitech called its 2010 Google TV project \"a mistake of implementation of a gigantic nature.\" Google also introduced a media streaming player, Nexus Q, at its 2012 I/O conference, but shelved the project after receiving poor feedback. However, Google has been successful with Chromecast. At $35, the dongle is cheaper than a set-top box and lets users stream Internet video through phones, tablets and computers running Google's Chrome browser. Market research suggests it's worth Google's while to keep trying for success in the TV market. A market researcher with Parks Associates told CNET that, while TV sales are down, sales of devices that plug into televisions and play video and music are expected to jump to 330 million units by 2017, double the total from last year.",

        "content": " Almost a year after awarding a cloud computing contract to Amazon Web Services, Central Intelligence Agency chief information officer Doug Wolfe on Tuesday said the agency is still adapting to working with the private sector on IT projects. Wolfe described a \"pretty interesting clash of cultures\" between the public and private sectors, addressing attendees Amazon Web Services' annual nonprofit and government symposium at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. For instance, the CIA is subjecting AWS' cloud product to the agency's stringent cybersecurity requirements before its scheduled deployment in the summer, he said. \"We've had some interesting conversations and debates on security,\" he said, adding, \"We're working through that. And I think that we're going to end up in a very good quality product, and a very secure product.\" The agency is also learning to procure IT services more efficiently when working with the private sector, Wolfe said. Amazon is charging on a cost-recovery basis, meaning the agency will only pay for the cloud products and services they use. \"If you're a government customer who has been used to just ordering up however much IT you want, and over-ordering typically \u2014 which people do, they often order for their peak need \u2014 if you're a government customer used to doing that, you're going to start getting a bill. You're going to start seeing exactly what your consumption cost, and start understanding exactly how server storage processing, et cetera, was applied to the problem. So we see this as a tremendous opportunity to sharpen our focus and be very efficient.\" The agency is still looking for ways to \"take the best of the private sector, lift it, and . . . be able to operate that for the intelligence community,\" Wolfe said.

        "name": "T-Mobile, bundles and the future of entertainment ",
        "content": " T-Mobile threw another one of its flashy \"Uncarrier\" events again Wednesday night, announcing that it will not charge its customers for data they use when listening to streaming music from some of the industry's top services. The news came just hours after Amazon.com announced that its first smartphone, the Fire phone, would offer free integration with Amazon's own Prime Music service and Prime Video. Both add more fuel to a trend we've seen coming for a while: The future of entertainment is in the bundle. Smartphone users have long used their phones more for data consumption than for actual phone calls. And music streaming over mobile phones is on the rise, up 32 percent in the last year across all devices. Ericsson reported that, by traffic volume, music services rank about in line with e-mail on most smartphones. Since Apple first paired its iTunes service with its music players and phones, device makers have been looking at ways to use entertainment services to sell devices (or vice versa, in Amazon's case). Music industry analyst Mark Mulligan wrote Thursday that he believes the bundling model is the best strategy for Apple as the company evaluates what to do with its recent acquisition of Beats Music. But Amazon is now the company to watch, Mulligan said, to see how well the model works in today's streaming landscape. \"[All] eyes will be on Amazon to see if the model is finally ready for prime time (pun sort of intended) now that it has been sneaked in through the back door,\" he wrote. With its latest announcement, T-Mobile has gone even further, by making music essentially a part of its data plan. Under the new program, any data charges customers would have picked up by streaming Pandora, Spotify, Rhapsody, iHeartRadio, iTunes Radio, Slacker, Samsung's Milk streaming services are excused. T-Mobile will also extend the same deal to the upcoming Beatport app. The company said that, between those eight services, it believes it has covered over 80 percent of the streaming music market. But it's taking suggestions from its customers on other services to add to its list. In an interview with The Washington Post, Gabriel Torres, T-Mobile's vice president for the southeast region, said that the carrier may be open to adding other kinds of services in the future. Video, for example, makes up around 30 percent of all traffic on mobile phones, and subsidizing that data would save customers a lot of money. But the company has no definite plans at this time, Torres said. As all of this entertainment comes to the smartphone -- and data consumption rises as a result -- it's not hard to imagine that more firms will follow T-Mobile's lead to lure customers. But the carrier is already fielding questions about whether its deal violates the principles of net neutrality -- the idea that there should be no preferential treatment in the flow of data on the Internet -- because this deal could be interpreted as a way to unfairly prop up those particular music services. The company has soundly rejected that argument. \"With all of these companies that we are working with, we don't have specific arrangements with them,\" said Torres. \"We're taking those streaming feeds and excluding them from the high-speed data bucket for customers. We're not paying for the subscription.\"",

        "name": "Amazon unveils its smartphone. But who will buy it? ",
        "content": " Amazon.com announced that it's officially getting into the smartphone market Wednesday, releasing the Fire Phone -- a clear play to get more users for its $99 per year Amazon Prime membership. The 4.7-inch phone, which starts at $199.99 and comes with a free year of the premium shopping service, makes it easier than ever for people to shop via Amazon. The phone, which will be offered exclusively through AT&T, has a button on the side that will immediately recognize products that users scan, listen to or watch, and then send them directly to Amazon.com to buy it. \"Fire Phone puts everything you love about Amazon in the palm of your hand,\" Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos said in a company press release. But there's one big problem for Amazon: It's not a great time to get into the smartphone market right now, particularly in the United States where the interest in new smartphones is flat. Nearly everyone who might want a smartphone in this countryprobably has one, and once customers get into a certain smartphone maker's orbit, they tend to stay there. There's a reason that Apple and Samsung command nearly 50 percent of the world's smartphone market between them -- and nearly all of the profits -- leaving all other companies to pick at the scraps. \"It's a nasty business,\" said Carl Howe, an analyst for the Yankee Group. \"At best they'll break even, and you need a lot of sales of other stuff at single-digit margins.\" So will this be worth it for Amazon? If there's one thing that Amazon isn't short on, it's ambition. Amazon's main innovations in the consumer electronics space have been focused on bundling things together to provide a one-stop shop -- the \"Store for Everything\" model. Having a smartphone in the mix opens up new worlds of potential for the company to expand its empire. With its Prime service, Amazon's proven that the bundle is a model worth chasing. A note from RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney ahead of the announcement noted that Prime consumers spend twice as much as non-Prime customers on Amazon; even owning a Kindle means that you're likely to spend 30 percent more than the average customer. A smartphone gives Amazon perhaps the most direct path to the consumer yet, given that people spend an estimated 22 hours of each day within reach of their smartphone. The tech giant has already laid track in the mobile payments space, announcing earlier this month that it was partnering with sites and stores around the Web to let online shoppers pay for things using the credit card information already store on Amazon. It also gives the company a way to break out even further from the online shopping world into the land of brick-and-mortar stores -- putting it on the cusp of what many say is the next major hurdle for retailers. \"Strategically, if you look at the cellphone, it can be the first real personal shopping assistant attuned and tailored to you,\" said Thom Blischok, chief retail strategist for the consultancy firm Strategy&. Down the line, Blischokbelieves that mobile devices will become the primary portal for personal shopping. And, he said, Amazon is the unique position to provide particularly good recommendations. \"I would expect Amazon would have a strong ability to tie past preferences with current trends\" to provide good suggestions, he said. It will also let users recognize images and words, so that users can, for example, call a business by simply scanning the phone number they see on a sign. It sports a 13 megapixel camera, a speedy processor and sensors that are able to track where users' heads and eyes are at all times. That means that the phone's display changes based on your viewing angle. These are some new ideas, but perhaps not enough to convince users to switch to the Fire, said Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen. \"I'm a little skeptical that what they're bringing to the table is enough to make people put down their current phone and change to a new device,\" he said. Nguyen said that this does make it seem like the company's upping its game on making good gadgets. But it's not a main focus of the company in the way that it is for Samsung or, certainly, Apple. Amazon's hardware, historically, just hasn't been very good at launch -- something that Bezos addressed in his speech. Because the company has its roots as an online bookstore and retailer, it's more focused on the perfect consumer experience than the slickest looking product. The entrance into a new market also raises questions, analysts said, about whether the company is getting any closer to making money. Wall Street and Amazon investors have given the company a lot of leeway on not delivering profits in the past, but many are growing frustrated with its razor-thin margins. Adding yet another business, particularly one as difficult as telecommunications, doesn't improve the picture. \"Do we really believe they can be all things in all businesses? I don't sense there's a clear vision of what they want to be when they grow up,\" Howe said.",

        "name": "Everything we think we know about Amazon's rumored smartphone ; A rumor roundup for today's Amazon hardware announcement. ",
        "content": " Online retail giant Amazon is set to unveil a new piece of hardware at an event in Seattle on Wednesday. The company is widely expected to reveal a smartphone that will give it yet another avenue to appeal directly to consumers. Despite months of apparent leaks, rumors and innuendo, the details are still pretty hazy. But here's what we think we know. (Disclosure: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) It is a smartphone. Rumors of an Amazon smartphone have swirled for years, so everyone is assuming this new hardware is a phone based on the promotional material Amazon has released so far. BGR, which has a pretty strong track record of coming through when it comes to Amazon leaks, even claimed to have photos of a prototype device. There are some pretty compelling reasons that Amazon would want to break into the mobile phone business. While the company got its start selling physical books and grew to sell almost any item in the world through a single Web site, Amazon has increasingly invested in digital services, from cloud computing to e-books and online video rentals. Its forays into the hardware space, including the Kindle line and FireTV, serve as direct portals between consumers and Amazon's online marketplace. But without a smartphone, it is missing out on chances to sell to customers when they're on the move. It's still technically possible that the Amazon hardware announcement scheduled for today is something else entirely. But basically every tech journalist out there is going to feel like a huge idiot if the company reveals it is releasing a game controller for FireTV or some other contraption. It's a 3D smartphone with a gazillion cameras. Along with the apparently leaked photos in April, BGR reported sources claiming the rumored phone had a total of six cameras -- some of which enables a glasses-less 3-D experience. Presumably, that 3-D effect and rumored tilt controls could be why people are moving their heads and freaking out in this Amazon-released promo video: According to TechCrunch, the technology behind this anticipated feature comes from Japanese company Omron's Okao Vision face sensing system, which it reports has been modified by developers in-house at Amazon. The software pack associated with the Okao Vision system \"can also recognize faces and facial attributes to estimate a person's gender, age and ethnicity\" per TechCrunch, but the outlet did not believe Amazon was planning to roll out these features in its initial smartphone. An AT&T exclusive? The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the device would be exclusive to AT&T customers at its initial launch -- much to the chagrin of T-Mobile CEO John Legere. This isn't too much of a stretch: Amazon already uses AT&T for data plans for its Kindle e-readers and tablets. Plus, AT&T has a history making exclusive deals. While the HTC First \"Facebook phone\" flopped, AT&T did pretty well as the exclusive carrier of Apple's iPhone for its first few years on the market. The killer app could be \"Prime Data.\" According to an April report from BGR, the smartphone will come with a \"unique wireless data plan,\" tentatively called \"Prime Data.\" \"Prime\" here likely refers to the Amazon membership program, which initially just offered free two-day shipping on many items for an annual flat rate, but has since added new features over the years, including streaming video and a lending library of e-books. Another hint for what \"Prime Data\" could be: In January, AT&T announced a \"sponsored data\" service in which certain data charges from consumers could be billed to a sponsoring company -- similar to how calls to a 1-800 number works. It doesn't seem too crazy to imagine that Amazon would seek to tie the benefits of Prime and AT&T's sponsored data to its entry into the smartphone market. If \"Prime Data\" is a deal with AT&T to exclude Amazon content from mobile data caps, that might be a powerful incentive to get users interested in the hardware -- and interested in buying Amazon content. Plus, it might explain why Amazon would agree to limit its device's potential audience to one carrier at launch.",

(It also sent a rather enigmatic gift to reporters covering the event: a copy of chief executive Jeff Bezos's favorite childhood book, \"Mr. Pine's Purple House,\" which focused on the importance of standing out from the crowd.) The tech giant has already released a line of tablets to accompany its Kindle e-readers, and even tried its hand at a set-top box. And its growing suite of entertainment options, marked most recently by the release of a streaming music service for its most loyal customers, can make its devices more appealing. But smartphones are a whole different animal. While the markets for other consumer electronics are more fluid, the smartphone industry is more or less dominated by Apple and Samsung, which control around 50 percent of the world's smartphone market between them. \"The most important thing we've done is to earn trust with customers,\" Bezos said, according to a report from Mashable.",

        "content": " AT&T will be the exclusive carrier of the smartphone Amazon.com is expected to unveil Wednesday, according to the Wall Street Journal. And T-Mobile chief executive officer John Legere is none too happy about it. (Disclosure: Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of the Washington Post.) In a series tweets posted Tuesday afternoon, Legere slammed the move -- likening the rumored decision to the flopped HTC First \"Facebook phone\" partnership and lamenting it as limiting consumer choice. Whew! @Amazon doesn't know what they just signed up for. Remember the Facebook phone? #yikes Really, @Amazon? What happened to home-town pride?  http://t.co/VBbkttgGwC Exclusivity sucks for customers. Exclusivity on @ATT sucks for the industry. #justsayin The odd thing is, big + bigger = fewer options for customers. Let's hope @amazon doesn't fall victim to the @att curse that is the facebook phone. #onemonth Remember when the facebook phone was discounted to 99cents? So like, the whole time it was available on @att.. Legere, who spent nearly 20 years of his career working his way up the ranks at AT&T, has cultivated a rebellious image since taking the top executive slot at T-Mobile USA in September 2012. The CEO forsakes suit and tie for  a trademark pink T-Mobile T-shirt underneath a blazer or leather jacket, and he seems to relish creating outrageous headlines. For instance, last year he crashed (and was kicked out of) AT&T's CES developer party -- reportedly out of a desire to watch Macklemore and Ryan Lewis perform. But Legere's personal antics are also mirrored by some of the aggressive growth tactics the company has introduced during his tenure under the \"uncarrier\" banner -- including doing away with service contracts and phone subsidies, offering free international data roaming, and offering to pay early termination fees for customers switching to the carrier. The campaign has resulted in customer gains, but the company hasn't yet seen that growth reflected in its revenue. So T-Mobile remains a bit of a scrappy underdog -- a fourth place finisher battling to tempt customers away from the competition, while rumors swirl about an acquisition by third-place Sprint. Meanwhile, AT&T remains the second largest mobile carrier in the United States -- and no stranger to Amazon or exclusive arrangements. AT&T currently provides wireless service to the online retailer's Kindle tablets and e-readers. In addition to the Facebook phone fiasco, AT&T was the exclusive carrier of Apple's iPhone for its first few years on the market. Obviously, if the rumored Amazon smartphone is successful, being cut out of the deal could be bad news for T-Mobile. But Legere might also be worried that an Amazon exclusive partnership with AT&T will overshadow the company's own \"uncarrier\" announcement scheduled for Wednesday. T-Mobile already relocated its event from Los Angeles to Seattle so technology journalists would not have to choose between it and Amazon's hardware announcement. (Correction: An earlier version of this story described erroneously AT&T as the largest wireless carrier in the U.S. It is the second largest after Verizon.)",

        "content": " \"Is it cold for Amazon to underprice books to capture market share?\" Vee Parker, a ruthless drug lord played by Lorraine Toussaint in \"Orange Is The New Black,\" asks an inmate working for her who questions her tactics in a recent episode. The women's prison drama has always had a particular talent for capturing the cultural zeitgeist \u2014 its characters read \"The Fault In Our Stars\" and \"The End Of Men\" \u2014 but its creators could not have anticipated how much Vee's words would resonate with the headlines. Amazon (whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post) stands accused of, as my colleague Steven Mufson reported in May, \"playing hardball in a contract dispute about how big a discount Hachette will give the giant online retailer and how to set prices for e-books.\" Hachette says that its titles are being shipped on delayed schedules even though it has provided enough copies to meet demand. Amazon has issued a statement defending its business practices but declined to talk to reporters about the charges. In the conflict between these two large companies, Hachette wants the public to believe that publishers, authors and readers are all on the same side against the retail giant. That is not necessarily the case. Author Hugh Howey, who published his \"Wool\" series through Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing program, recently raised sharp questions about Hachette's interests in its dispute with Amazon. Just because Hachette wants to charge more for the e-books it publishes, he argues, does not mean those prices are pegged to production costs or that authors would share in those higher prices. \"Publishers are waging a war here for higher prices and lower royalties,\" Howey wrote. \"$14.99 is their ideal price for an e-book that costs nothing to print, warehouse, or ship. That's twice what mass market paperbacks used to cost, which is what they are replacing. Reminds you of how cheaper-to-produce CDs suddenly cost twice as much as cassettes simply because they were new, doesn't it?\" Amazon's tactics in its feud with Hachette and now Time Warner, including delaying shipping on Hachette books and refusing to take pre-orders for \"The Lego Movie,\" are certainly annoying if you badly want a physical copy of a book or a movie. But they are short-term tools that Amazon is using to drive down prices for consumers. Hachette and Time Warner may be angry about Amazon's toughness and power to influence the market. But that does not mean that Amazon is ignoring its customers' long-term best interests. Hachette, after all, is one of three publishers who settled a price-fixing suit brought by the Justice Department in 2012: Those companies ended up paying $69 million to readers who purchased their e-books over a two-year period. That Hachette would try to ratchet up prices is understandable. But that does not make the effort admirable or a service to customers or authors. Of course, just because Hachette is self-interested does not make Amazon a paragon of ethical business either. As Amazon has become a major player in the clothing and shoe retail, how has its market share impacted garment workers who produce the products it sells in such great volume? We might joke about Bezos's idea for Amazon to do delivery by drone, but Amazon's commitment to exceptionally fast delivery is a serious business with serious implications: The Labor Department is investigating two deaths in Amazon warehouses. Journalists have been calling attention to the conditions in those facilities for years. I am all for an ethical conversation about Amazon's role in the American economy and marketplace. But in that discussion, we should not confuse the interests of big media companies with the interests of the people who work for them and the people who buy their products.",

        "content": " Amazon Prime members are getting a new perk: The company announced Thursday that it is launching its own streaming music service as part of its premium membership package. The service, called Prime Music, comes at no extra charge to members of Amazon's Prime service, who pay $99 a year for free two-day shipping and access to the company's video content. The move gives Amazon a foot in the door of the growing online music world and may help it smooth any ruffled feathers among its valuable Prime customers after it decided to hike the annual cost of Prime membership earlier this year to $99 from $79. Prime Music is ad-free and unlimited. Like Spotify, Prime Music will let users pick the specific tracks that they want, rather than having them tune into a Pandora-like radio station featuring songs from a certain genre. Amazon also is applying its recommendation expertise to the service by suggesting tracks you might like based on the ones you choose yourself and by offering curated playlists with names like \"Feel-Good Country\" and \"80s Dance Floor Fillers.\" Before you get too excited, however, there are a couple of caveats. The main one is that while Amazon's new service does include songs from top artists such as Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars, Blake Shelton and Madonna, the online retail giant hasn't struck deals with all the major music labels. So, the odds are that you'll quickly find that some song you want to listen to - like any original Beatles song - isn't available on the free service. Missing, too, are the hits of the moment. BuzzFeed reported that Amazon won't get access to songs until the tunes have been out for six months. That kind of delay echoes other content deals the company has made, such as its agreement with HBO to include only items from the back catalogue in Prime. Ford Motor Co. said Thursday that it is lowering the fuel economy ratings on six of its models, including a number of hybrids, and will reimburse owners for the difference. The No. 2 U.S. automaker said the ratings will be cut on its 2013 and 2014 model year hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles as well as most 2014 Fiesta cars. It was the second time Ford has cut fuel ratings for the C-Max hybrid in less than a year. \"We apologize to our customers and will provide goodwill payments to affected owners,\" Alan Mulally, Ford's chief executive, said in a statement. \"We also are taking steps to improve our processes and prevent issues like this from happening again.\" The restatement of mileage estimates is nothing new in the auto industry. Last August, Ford - which has touted its superior fuel efficiency in the past - cut the ratings for the C-Max hybrid by up to 7 mpg after complaints from consumers and experts that the model's actual mileage fell short of the company's claims. In 2012, an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency showed that Hyundai Motor Co. and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. overstated fuel economy by at least a mile per gallon. The South Korean carmakers last December agreed to pay $395 million to settle lawsuits related to the matter. The largest change is for Ford's Lincoln MKZ hybrid, for which the combined city and highway fuel economy value was reduced by 7 miles per gallon. Other affected models include four versions of the Fiesta, the hybrid and Energi versions of the Fusion, and the C-Max hybrid and Energi. l U.S. retail sales rose less than expected in May and first-time applications for jobless benefits increased last week, but the data did little to alter perceptions that the economy is regaining steam. The Commerce Department said Thursday that retail sales gained 0.3 percent. While that was below the 0.6 percent rise expected on Wall Street, April sales were revised higher to show a 0.5 percent increase, helping to keep growth forecasts intact. In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 317,000 for the week ended June 7. Despite the rise, claims are not too far from their pre-recession lows, and job growth continues at a steady clip. l Lululemon Athletica Inc. slumped to the lowest level in three years after the yogawear retailer cut its full-year earnings forecast. The shares plunged 16 percent to $37.25 at the close of trading Thursday, the lowest since March 2011. The company has been seeking to address supply-chain issues and quality checks that slowed deliveries, and also has been trying to regain shoppers' trust after it recalled its popular line of black Luon yoga pants for being too sheer. l A former BP senior engineer found guilty last year of destroying evidence related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill was granted a new trial based on his claim of juror misconduct during deliberations. Kurt Mix was convicted by a federal jury in December of one of two counts of obstruction of justice. Prosecutors said Mix deleted from his mobile phone text messages and voice mails related to BP's effort to estimate the size of what turned out to be largest U.S. offshore oil spill. The Justice Department declined to comment on the ruling. l Many federal workers and contractors who earn the minimum wage are getting a raise next year. Labor Secretary Thomas E.

        "content": " Weeks after we learned that Amazon.com stopped taking preorders for books published by Hachette, the online retailer has now put the kibosh on advance orders for coming Warner Home Video products like \"The Lego Movie.\" The move pits Amazon against a different content industry, but the underlying business logic is the same: Amazon wants to pay the supplier less for products, and the supplier wants Amazon to pay more. This kind of negotiation happens all the time, but Amazon's talks are drawing attention because of the dominant role it plays in getting us the stuff we buy. (Disclaimer: Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Amazon says its hardball tactics are meant to secure a better deal for you and me. Others are calling Amazon a bully for punishing content providers simply for trying to get fairly compensated. If you're having trouble picking a side, don't feel bad. This is a complicated issue. On the face of it, Amazon appears to be using its substantial leverage as a seller to extract huge concessions from suppliers. Let's just take the book publishing industry. Amazon effectively gets a 53 percent discount on all Random House titles. Kindle e-books account for a fifth of the entire U.S. book market, and within the e-book sector specifically, Amazon enjoys a two-thirds lock. If you're a publisher, you can't not sell on Amazon. Amazon knows this, and has an incentive to demand that publishers bend over backwards to accommodate the company. That said, Amazon has also vastly expanded the overall market for books more generally. The novelist Barry Eisler defended the company earlier this month, arguing that Amazon has empowered legions of self-published authors. Small publishers who previously had trouble competing against the so-called Big Five report having benefited from the more level playing field that the Amazon platform provides. Publishers themselves aren't exactly put-upon or defenseless, either. Consumers have long complained about the power of academic publishers to increase textbook prices, for instance. Literary agents have called out publishers for giving authors a raw deal. And most recently, in a controversial court case involving Apple, publishers were found to have acted like a cartel in trying to raise margins on e-books. Of course, the publishers might say this whole sticky court case could've been avoided if only Amazon hadn't tried to sell e-books at such a low price. And the online retailer's habit of selling e-books below cost as a way to encourage Kindle adoption certainly fits into a much longer narrative about its stormy relationship with publishers.",

        "name": "Alibaba takes on EBay, Etsy with U.S-based shopping site ",
        "content": " There's a new online shopping site in town that hopes to take on likes of Etsy, eBay and Amazon on their own turf. The name is \"11 Main.\" It's being launched in beta by the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, according to a press release from 11 Main. Alibaba is bigger than eBay and Amazon combined and dominates e-commerce in China. Its first foray into U.S.-based online sales comes at it prepares for its U.S. initial public offering, which may come as soon as August and is expected to be one of the largest IPOs in history. The \"invitation-only\" site will host more than 1,000 upscale specialty shops and boutiques that sell clothing, accessories, interior goods, arts and crafts \u2014 and it plans to keep adding more. The site aims to create an online experience that resembles your local \"Main Street\" shopping experience. The new site appears tailored to American tastes with a clean look and modern layout. 11 Main says sellers and their products will be subject to review by the site \u2014 perhaps an effort to combat the bad reputation of Taobao, Alibaba's version of Amazon that is rife with counterfeit goods. There are guidelines for product quality, customer service, photography and even background choice. (Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) Forrester analyst Sucharita Mulpuru told the AP she believes Alibaba won't find it easy to break into the already-crowded online shopping industry. \"U.S. e-commerce is crowded and relies on high marketing expenses to rise above the clutter,\" she said. \"The hope is high. We'll see if they live up to expectations.\" But 11 Main thinks they can offer merchants something existing sites don't. \"There are many small shop owners that are looking for broader platforms, but when they look at the broader platforms, those are not necessarily structured to support their brands or their identities,\" Mike Effle, president and general manager of 11 Main, told the Wall Street Journal. E-commerce is indeed crowded, but boutique e-commerce \u2014 Etsy, for example \u2014 is a niche that has fewer major players, most of which aren't familiar to the masses. Sellers may opt for sites such as eBay or Amazon, which more people know, but in doing so they compromise the ability to personalize their retail space. Susan Berry, who sells her Oshun Spirit brand of natural skin care and beauty products, has already joined 11 Main. \"I'm always looking for alternatives to eBay,\" she told the Journal. Berry has sold on eBay since 2001, but worries about relying too heavily on one site. 11 Main promises brands creative control over their space on the site \u2014 and the ability to personalize it with photo and video, unlike the generic listings of major e-commerce sites such as Amazon, eBay and even Etsy, a site for sellers of vintage and handmade goods. And with Alibaba behind it, the site has access to tons of money for marketing. An 11 Main spokesman told the Journal the company has a \"robust marketing plan\" to support the growth of the shops featured on the new site, but declined to share specific plans or how much it plans to spend on advertising. That was part of 11 Main's appeal for Tiger Bachler, one of the site's beta vendors who owns Alys Grace, a small chain of upscale clothing stores in California's Bay Area. \"We've been struggling with the ability to reach a large audience being a small business,\" she told the AP. \"We anticipate [11 Main] will be able to give us a wider audience with their marketplace expertise and marketing power.\" Cost is part of the site's appeal. Brands will pay a 3.5 percent commission, the same that Etsy charges. But that is half what most other major U.S. shopping sites charge, according to the Journal. Without ads or retailer fees, commissions are how the site will make money, the AP said. After eyeing the United States for its IPO, Alibaba made several deals with U.S. companies. In March, the company announced it bought a minority stake in TangoMe, a mobile messaging start-up, for $215 million. Last year, the company invested $206 million in ShopRunner, an Amazon rival.",

        "content": " Amazon.com will start managing subscription payments for start-ups and other companies - the latest in a series of quiet moves the e-commerce giant has made into PayPal's turf over the past year. The service, which launched Monday, allows the company's more than 240 million active users to use credit card details stored on Amazon.com to pay for services such as a monthly phone bill or a digital music subscription. Amazon then charges a fee on each transaction. EBay's PayPal has long dominated online payment services, but Amazon sees plenty of scope to push into new areas. The new service broadens Amazon's profitable role as a middleman for third-party sellers, which account for 40 percent of its sales and extends its influence beyond its Web site. It also comes ahead of June 18 unveiling by chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, of what is widely expected to be a smartphone key to expanding Amazon's role in mobile payments. \"You should see it as one of many things that we'll do to expand where people might think about Amazon helping them,\" Tom Taylor, Amazon vice president of seller services, said in an interview. Amazon has been testing the new service over the past several months with start-ups including Ting, a mobile-phone company that is part of Tucows. Those who used recurring payments by Amazon spent 30 percent more on Ting's Web site, product manager Justen Burdette said in an interview arranged by Amazon. Some analysts have said that Amazon has been held back in payments because merchants are wary of handing over customer data to the company, which has a record of rapidly expanding into new areas and competing with sellers. But Taylor said the only details collected by Amazon as part of the new service is the dollar amount of each transaction and not any \"item-level information.\" He added that the service would encourage Amazon users who might otherwise be leery of handing over their credit card details to a fledgling companies to try out them out. \"If you think about giving a merchant that you may not know very well the right to continue to charge your credit card in the future, you really want to know that a good relationship with Amazon stands behind that,\" Taylor said. \"We hope whoever the next Spotify out there is is thinking about Amazon,\" he added, referring to the privately held, popular digital music subscription service.

        "name": "Can Amazon finally make 3D video a thing? ",
        "content": " The buzz is building around the mysterious gadget that Amazon.com is showcasing in a public event this month, with the general consensus being that the tech giant is about to launch a phone that can project or at least display 3D images. The idea that Amazon might launch a phone that has some sort of 3D capability is actually one that surfaced last year. As my Switch colleague Brian Fung noted, the promotional video features a lot of head-tilting that could indicate those reports are true. Business Insider notes that there's even something that clearly looks like a phone visible in Amazon's promo video. If Amazon can actually make a 3D display work in something that appeals to a wide audience, it will crack a problem that the tech industry has had for years -- how to get people to actually adopt 3D display technology. It won't be easy. We've been here, or somewhere near it, before. Back in 2011, when 3D video seemed like the coming trend, both HTC and LG tried to jump start a 3D smartphone movement. Both made phones with glasses-free displays that displayed images with depth, if not ones that actually popped up out of the screen. Complaints about short battery life plagued both models. And the fact that users could only watch their 3D video on those specific devices kept the format from really taking off -- the phones simply weren't widespread enough. Fast-forward three years, and some things have changed. For one, it seems more possible than ever that the real promise of a 3D display -- projecting holograms -- could feasibly work in a phone. One company, Ostendo, made headlines earlier this week after the Wall Street Journal featured the company's tiny, smartphone-sized holographic projector, which promises to bring crisp, usable holograms to your phone that pop out of the screen, rather than images that look fully fleshed-out to the user in front of them. In that case, the reach problem wouldn't be as much of an issue, especially since the rumor mill indicates that Amazon won't be restricting the feature to only the media you'd want to share, such as video, but applying it more broadly to things such as the icons. What hasn't changed is that the amount of skepticism Amazon's supposed \"3D phone\" faced on its last time through the rumor mill. Apart from a couple of notable applications -- mapping, perhaps, or video gaming -- many consumers are scratching their heads about what they'd do, exactly, with a phone that projects 3D images. Sure, the idea that you could video chat, or even watch video in holographic form sounds intriguing. But it hardly seems practical in every day life unless you're willing to literally broadcast what you're doing on your phone to those around you. In other words, if the rumors are true, Amazon will have to put forward a seriously good application of the technology on the phone to make a holographic display seem like anything other than a gimmick.",

In a series of breathless commentaries, Amazon has been likened to Vladimir Putin, Tony Soprano and Darth Vader, and accused of pursuing a \"scorched-earth capitalism\" designed to drive all publishers and competing booksellers out of business. The future of Western culture and democracy are said to hang in the balance. While the stakes, I suspect, are a good deal less dramatic than that, something interesting is going on here. In business terms, what is about to play out is the next round in a long-running battle between a manufacturing cartel (the publishers) and a monopoly retailer (Amazon) for control of the value chain that links book writers and their readers. In most respects, it is similar to the battles in other parts of the news and entertainment sector where digital technology has also upset the old order but a new order has yet to emerge. Four years ago, in an earlier round of this battle, the publishers were victorious. It began when Amazon removed the \"Buy It Now\" button from all Macmillan books after the publisher demanded a new pricing model for e-books that would have forced Amazon to raise its prices. Macmillan responded by refusing to sell Amazon any of its books. Amazon, fearing it would lose its overwhelming dominance in the e-book business to Apple and the new iPad, caved to the publishers' demand. Round 2, however, went to Amazon. Prompted by a complaint by Amazon, the Justice Department launched a price-fixing investigation that uncovered a flagrant conspiracy among Apple and five of the biggest publishing houses to break Amazon's Kindle monopoly and raise e-book prices. To settle the government's allegations, the publishers agreed to pay $100 million in fines and rebates, and to modify their contracts to give Amazon the right to set whatever retail prices it wanted. Now with those modified contracts expiring, the publishers and Amazon are about to do battle once again. The Amazon view, reflecting the tech culture, is that digital revolution makes it possible to reduce the role of the middlemen and gatekeepers of the old economy - the publishers - whose pricing models and ways of doing business limited competition and extracted too much money for themselves while adding too little value. If the publishers prevail, the Amazon camp foresees higher prices, fewer books by unknown writers and a slowdown in the transition to e-books. The industry's view is that by bringing the price-fixing case against the publishers, the government destroyed the last best hope of real competition in the book industry, in the name of trying to save it. While markets are great for things like toilet paper and soft drinks, it argues, they cannot be trusted to sustain a healthy book ecosystem capable of producing quality books. If Amazon is allowed to squeeze publishers even further, the industry warns that publishers will be starved for the money they use to support mid-list writers and new authors, reducing the book business to mass-appeal best-sellers and an endless supply of uncurated self-published dreck. I recently gained some new perspective on these issues while trying to sell my first book. While I came away from the process with a greater appreciation for what publishers, editors and agents do, I also came away thinking that the industry's pricing practices are a bit screwy. Let's start with the author's advance - or more precisely, the non-refundable cash advance against the author's royalty payments for every book sold. In theory, the advance is supposed to reflect the publisher's best estimate of how many books will be sold. In practice, 80 percent of books don't sell enough copies to \"earn out\" the advance. This is a curious way for an industry to set pay for talent. If publishers are so bad at predicting book sales and can't stop themselves from overpaying on advances, then why not change to a system that doesn't require them to take virtually all of the upfront risk? As it happens, authors from time to time have offered to take a smaller advance in exchange for a royalty rate higher than the 15 percent industry standard. Such offers, however, are routinely and universally rejected. This is the kind of business practice that is common in cartel-like industries, like real estate agents and their 6 percent commissions. In this case, it's a way for publishers to stop themselves from getting into self-destructive bidding wars for best-selling authors and celebrity writers. And as long as all the publishers tacitly agree to play by the same rules, it allows them to under-pay these winners, to the benefit of both their shareholders and authors who never earn back their advances. This practice, however, is now threatened by self-publishing platforms at Amazon and elsewhere that make it possible for authors to bypass publishers completely - to hire freelance editors and publicists and sell their ooks directly to readers online, keeping as much as 70 percent of the sales price. Given this threat to the publishers' role as exclusive gatekeepers to the book distribution system, my guess is that it's only a matter of time before the key negotiations with authors will be over royalty percentages rather than advances. This more competitive arrangement would also force publishers to demonstrate they are providing good value for their services. Another oddity of the publishing world is that those royalties are set differently for printed books and e-books. The accompanying chart, drawn from a recent presentation made by HarperCollins to industry analysts, tells the story. Authors makes about $1.60 less from a typical e-book sale than a hardcover sale, while the publishing house is left with $2.20 more in gross profit (that's the money used to pay for editing, marketing and general overhead, as well as profit for investors). In other words, while the work done by author and publisher is exactly the same for a printed book or an e-book, what they are paid for that work is significantly different. Now ask yourself: Wouldn't it make more sense for the industry to change the way it structures royalties and wholesale prices so that everyone - the publishers, the authors and multi-channel retailers such as Amazon - are economically indifferent to what form of a book customers want to buy? The irony here is that despite the best efforts of the publishers to slow the migration from $28 hardbacks to $10 e-books, the shift has provided a significant boost to their profits and profitability. Cannibalizing their old business turns out to have been very good for the publishers' bottom line. So you can perhaps understand why Amazon - which for all its market power makes very little profit on its e-book sales - is now demanding a bigger slice of the pie. In this latest clash between the monopolist and the cartel, neither side comes with clean hands or pure heart. The publishers are more than a little disingenuous in conflating their own interests with those of authors, readers and booksellers. And Amazon might want to consider that its admirable campaign to lower book prices may have reached a point of diminishing return, with the risk that further cuts really will have an adverse effect on consumer choice and the quality of what is published. Rather than using readers and writers as hostages in their ongoing battle over discounts, commissions and co-op fees, both sides might better use their ingenuity to come up with a simpler and more rational structure for the industry's economics that is better able to adapt to changing technology and market realities.

        "name": "Amazon says it\u2019s looking out for customers in its dispute with book publisher Hachette; The online retailer said it is entitled to seek better terms in negotiations with the publisher Hachette. ",
        "content": " Amazon.com defended its tough tactics in a contract dispute with the Hachette Book Group as some critics called for boycotts of the giant online retailer and authors continued to ask for government intervention to blunt the company's market power. In its first comments on the spat, Amazon said in a post on its Web site Tuesday evening that it was entitled to seek better terms in negotiations with Hachette and asserted that it was \"doing so on behalf of customers.\" It added that it was no different from other retailers seeking favorable terms from suppliers. \"Negotiating for acceptable terms is an essential business practice that is critical to keeping service and value high for customers in the medium and long term,\" Amazon said. For those who cast Amazon as a behemoth locked in battle with a smaller firm, Amazon reminded customers that Hachette is \"part of a $10 billion media conglomerate,\" the French-based Lagard\u00e8re. While it praised Hachette for negotiating \"in good faith,\" Amazon said \"we are not optimistic that this will be resolved soon.\" \"This is a monumental game of chicken,\" said Davia Temin, a crisis-management and media strategist at Temin and Co. in New York. \"We've seen it before with CBS and cable stations, and other instances where the public has been disadvantaged because of a battle of titans where both of the titans seem to put the consumer last.\" Amazon's defense came amid a chorus of criticism from authors, agents and others in the publishing business who have said the giant online retailer's tactics are hurting Hachette's sales, and thereby the publishing house's authors and readers. The publisher's authors have said that Amazon has kept their book prices high, stretched out delivery times and tried to direct customers to books published by other firms. Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post, acknowledged that it is keeping smaller inventories of Hachette titles than it ordinarily does and that it is \"no longer taking pre-orders on titles whose publication dates are in the future.\" The company said that if there is no stock on hand, customers could place orders as soon as Hachette fills inventory orders. But the online retailer said that \"suppliers get to decide the terms under which they are willing to sell to a retailer. It's reciprocally the right of a retailer to determine whether the terms on offer are acceptable and to stock items accordingly.\" Many analysts have questioned whether Amazon is hurting its hard-won reputation for speedy delivery and convenience by trying to turn customers away from Hachette's books, which include bestselling authors such as T.D. Jakes, James Patterson, Malcolm Gladwell, J.K. Rowling and Stephen Colbert. Amazon said that Hachette titles made up only a tiny portion of its sales. \"If you order 1,000 items from Amazon, 989 will be unaffected by this interruption,\" it said. \"If you do need one of the affected titles quickly, we regret the inconvenience and encourage you to purchase a new or used version from one of our third-party sellers or from one of our competitors.\" But some analysts said that Amazon risks driving customers away from other products. \"The minute some question your motive, your ubiquity, you're cracking your facade,\" Temin said. \"I wonder how good a strategy it is for your customer relations, especially since the core audience of Amazon started around books and a reverence for books.\" Earlier on Tuesday, before Amazon posted its response, Reuters media columnist Jack Shafer proclaimed that he was going to stop purchasing goods from Amazon until it justified or ended its tactics in the Hachette dispute. \"Amazon doesn't owe me access to Hachette titles, and I don't owe Amazon my business,\" he wrote. \"So I'm stuffing my 1-click button into my drawer of abandoned devices and chargers and won't reclaim it until Amazon makes this thing right.\" Tom Scocca, an editor for the Web site Gawker, said \"Amazon has gone too far,\" although he acknowledged the inconvenience and difficulty of shopping elsewhere in a piece titled \"Let's Boycott Amazon! Now Where Do We Buy Stuff?\" Some analysts noted that publishers also strive to drive hard bargains, and that they have been doing well on the rising sales of e-books. Lagard\u00e8re said in an earnings presentation this year that e-books made up 30 percent of Hachette's net U.S. sales in 2013. Amazon said it would be willing to evenly split with Hachette the cost of a fund \"to be allocated by Hachette to mitigate the impact of this dispute on author royalties.\" It said it did this during a dispute with the publisher Macmillan. Hachette issued a statement Wednesday saying, \"It is good to see Amazon acknowledge that its business decisions significantly affect authors' lives.\" It said it would \"spare no effort\" to reach a deal with Amazon. Hachette said, \"Once we have reached such an agreement, we will be happy to discuss with Amazon its ideas about compensating authors for the damage its demand for improved terms may have done them, and to pass along any payments it considers appropriate.\" Despite the obstacles Amazon erected for customers seeking Hachette books, many of the publisher's titles continue to sell well. Its imprints captured three of the top four spots on the current New York Times bestseller list for hardcover fiction and the number seven and eight spots for hardcover non-fiction. High Hachette sales could undercut arguments that Amazon possesses undue market power. steven.mufson@washpost.com",

        "content": " For the first time, Amazon is publicly acknowledging a long-simmering dispute between it and a major publishing company, Hachette Book Group. At the heart of the fight is how much money will flow to Hachette from Amazon sales of e-books. But because of the disagreement, Amazon is now playing hardball with the French-based publisher by stocking fewer print copies in its warehouses, ending support for Hachette pre-orders and making it generally more difficult for consumers to read Hachette-linked authors, such as J.K. Rowling. For titles where there are no copies on hand, customers can still place orders through Amazon, the company said, but they will take longer since Amazon must first order the inventory from Hachette. \"If you do need one of the affected titles quickly, we regret the inconvenience and encourage you to purchase a new or used version from one of our third-party sellers or from one of our competitors,\" Amazon said in a statement Tuesday night. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Sounds simple enough. But most of us have grown accustomed to going to Amazon for practically all ommerce. So, where can you pre-order, say, Robert Galbraith's (aka Rowling's) \"The Silkworm\" now? One place to start looking is Barnes & Noble, where pre-orders of Hachette books are still possible. Another option is Portland, Ore.-based Powell's. And if you're just looking for regular books that are already on the market, you can go straight to the source.",

        "name": "Authors, publishers say feud with Amazon has escalated; Titles from Hachette Group are disappearing from the Web giant or facing big delays ",
        "content": " Meryl Gordon spent three years laboring over her latest book, \"The Phantom of Fifth Avenue,\" a tale of a wealthy heiress who became a recluse in her vast apartment overlooking New York City's Central Park. It received good reviews in Publishers' Weekly, and Kirkus and was doing well with pre-publication orders on Amazon. Until Thursday. That day, Amazon stopped taking advance orders and posted a notice saying \"Currently Unavailable,\" even though the publisher, Grand Central Publishing, said books are ready for shipping. Amazon said it would e-mail customers when the book becomes available. Amazon this week put the same notice on other new releases published by the Hachette Book Group, marking another step in the continuing spat over contract terms between the online retailing behemoth and the French-based publishing house, which owns Grand Central Publishing, Hyperion Books and Little, Brown & Co. Among the books affected is J.K. Rowling's novel \"The Silkworm,\" due out June 19. The two sides are widely believed to be bickering over e-book pricing and whether Amazon can get bigger discounts for Hachette books. Hachette alleges that Amazon has stretched out the delivery times of the publisher's books to as long as five weeks, even though Hachette has the books in stock. Hachette's authors have said that Amazon has also raised prices of the firm's books and tried to steer customers to books published by other companies in an effort to pressure Hachette into accepting Amazon's terms. Some Hachette books with modest sales volumes have been dropped altogether. \"Please know that we are doing everything in our power to find a solution to this difficult situation, one that best serves our authors and their work, and that preserves our ability to survive and thrive as a strong and author-centric publishing company,\" Hachette chief executive Michael Pietsch said in a letter to authors this week. Amazon, whose chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post, did not respond to requests for comment. On the list of best-selling books on Amazon, Gordon's book had ranked in the 2,000 range Thursday and fell to 4,025 by midday Friday. By Friday evening, its ranking sank to 6,945. \"I spent three years on this book, and I'm very happy and excited by it,\" Gordon said. \"But it's devastating as an author to see the market power they have. It just comes as a bit of a sucker punch when you are trying to reach an audience.\" \"I'm not inclined to make moral judgments. Private enterprises act in their own interests, and that's what they should be expected to do,\" said Mike Shatzkin, founder of the Idea Logical Company and author of a publishing blog called The Shatzkin Files. Indeed, companies in other industries often pressure suppliers for better prices. Cable companies bargain with channels over television content, Wal-Mart pressures suppliers in its quest for low consumer prices, and physical bookstores seek payments from publishers for better shelf display. But Shatzkin questioned whether Amazon's tactics this time were in the company's best interests. He said Amazon might argue that pressuring Hachette over better contract terms would help bring consumers lower prices in the long term. But for now, Shatzkin added, customers are suffering from higher prices and less choice. The dispute has broken out now because of consent decrees signed in 2012. When publishers plotted earlier about how to resist Amazon's negotiating demands, the Justice Department said they were guilty of collusion ande-book price fixing under antitrust laws. It allowed retailers, including Amazon, to discount publishers' lists by 30 percent for two years. Hachette is one of five major publishing houses that agreed to terms under consent decrees. Negotiations between Amazon and the biggest publishing houses, Random House and Harper Collins, still lie ahead. Amazon is trying to set a precedent with the Hachette deal, publishing industry experts say. \"They're going to drive out both distributors and the people who create the product. Plus writing is not a consumer product like tissue paper,\" Roxana Robinson, president of the Authors' Guild, said. \"It's not a commodity. It's part of our culture and can't be controlled in this fashion.\" Independent booksellers have been trying to take advantage of the Amazon dispute with Hachette. Politics and Prose in the District has set up a table featuring Hachette books, including \"David and Goliath\" by Malcolm Gladwell; Brad Stone's \"The Everything Store\" (about Amazon); Stephen Colbert's \"America Again\"; and James Patterson's \"Gone.\" Bradley Graham, co-owner of Politics and Prose (and a former Washington Post staff writer), said the display had given some of the titles a boost in sales, but he deplored the impact of Amazon's feud with Hachette. \"If the Justice Department is not looking into this and remains reluctant to go after Amazon for their abusive behavior, then I think that should be a real concern to the American reading public,\" Graham said. One of the authors caught in the middle is Daniel Schulman, who wrote \"Sons of Wichita,\" about the Koch brothers. The publication date was Tuesday, and the Amazon page for it says shipping will take three to five weeks. There is only a modest 10 percent discount from the $30 list price. \"Hachette authors are kind of caught in the crossfire of this business dispute, and it's us that are really getting hurt here,\" Schulman said. \"This is how we make our livelihood. And if you can't sell books, it directly affects your ability to sell another book if your book is not seen as a success. It's disheartening after pouring your soul into the subject.\" Schulman has been talking about his book at every opportunity, including public radio's \"Fresh Air\" and MSNBC. A New York Times review will appear this weekend, he said. \"I kind of have the wind at my back,\" he said. \"I just want people to be able to go where they want to go to buy it. I'm just trying to keep a level head. I think this situation is going to resolve itself in a few days. But I know other authors are just beside themselves.\" steven.mufson@washpost.com",

        "content": " Ah, Memorial Day weekend. Time to kick back with something sizzling on the grill, a cold drink and -- if Amazon.com has anything to say about it -- enough popcorn to accommodate an end-to-end binge-watching of \"The Wire.\" Last month, HBO and Amazon announced an agreement to put free episodes from the past seasons of some of their most popular shows on Amazon Prime Instant Video subscription service. It marked the first time that HBO had agreed to stream any of its shows off of its own app, HBO Go. Now, just in time for the holiday weekend, Amazon announced Wednesday that the first wave of its content from HBO has hit its online video streaming site. The first round of shows includes the entire run of \"The Sopranos,\" \"The Wire,\" \"Deadwood,\" \"Rome\" and \"Six Feet Under,\" among others. Amazon is also offering a handful of episodes from other popular, ongoing series, such as \"Boardwalk Empire\" and \"True Blood\" as part of the deal, which is supposed to give the tech giant more exclusive HBO content in the coming years. This is part of a major effort by Amazon to pull more customers into its ecosystem and get them to become regular subscribers to its $99-a-year Prime service. Here's the full list of shows coming to the service Tuesday, according to Amazon: All seasons of revered classics such as The Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood, Rome and Six Feet Under, and of recent favorites such as Eastbound & Down, Enlightened and Flight of the Conchords Select seasons of current series such as True Blood, Boardwalk Empire andTreme Epic miniseries, including Band of Brothers, The Pacific, John Adams, Parade's End and Angels in America Hit original movies like Mary and Martha, Temple Grandin and You Don't Know Jack Hilarious original comedy specials from Louis CK, Ellen DeGeneres, Lewis Black and Bill Maher Pedigreed documentaries including When the Levees Broke, Ghosts of Abu Ghraib and the Autopsy and Iceman series Amazon's deal with HBO adds a big feather to the company's video-streaming cap as it takes on Hulu Plus, Apple, Google and, of course, Netflix -- which itself announced Wednesday that its greatly expanding its streaming empire in Europe . Amazon, which has had a much weaker selection of content than its competitors, has begun bidding much more aggressively for contracts -- something Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings noted in a Netflix earnings call last year. The race to provide better, exclusive content has helped improve consumers' options, though it may also behind recent price increases for Netflix and Amazon as the companies deal with fast growth and rising acquisition costs. Netflix just raised rates by $1 a month for new subscribers. Amazon announced in March that it was raising its annual Prime subscription rate, which also includes free two-day shipping, to $99 from $79. In such a competitive market, giving customers access to prized programming is key. Consumers are less likely to question a price increase if they get to watch their favorite programming in a convenient way. Prime Video has clearly become a much larger focus for Amazon, which has also launched its own original series and released a video set-top box, the Amazon Fire TV. Controlling how consumers get access to television programming and movies gives tech companies like Amazon an easy path into the living room -- where Americans still spend a lot of time in front of the big screen.",

        "name": "Gay Eagle Scout presses Amazon on support ",
        "content": " One of the nation's first openly gay Eagle Scouts has a message for Amazon: Stop supporting an organization that discriminates. Pascal Tessier, a 17-year-old from Chevy Chase, Md., who made history when he received the Boy Scouts' highest ranking this year, held a news conference Monday in front of Amazon.com's office in Northwest Washington. At the event, he announced his intent to deliver more than 120,000 signatures to the company's Seattle office in an effort to encourage the online retailer to drop the Boy Scouts from the list of organizations that can benefit from its charitable program, AmazonSmile. Tessier's effort comes after the Boy Scouts kicked out Geoff McGrath, an openly gay scoutmaster in Seattle. Tessier, a senior at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, put his Eagle Scout rank on the line last year when he spoke to the media about being gay and participated in a public demonstration in advance of a vote held by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America to determine whether to lift a long-standing ban on gay members and leaders. Ultimately, the council voted to accept gay youths but not gay adults. Tessier said what happened to McGrath confirmed for him that his time with the organization is limited - unless change occurs. \"It kind of re-ignited the feeling of anxiety and fear,\" he said. \"It proved they are still going to punish adults, so when I do turn 18, now I know for a fact I will get kicked out.\" His birthday is in August. Deron Smith, director of communications for the Boy Scouts of America, cited a previous statement on the issue in response to Tessier: \"Scouting represents millions of youth and adult members in diverse communities across the nation, many who have a variety of beliefs on a number of topics. We fully understand and appreciate that not everyone will agree with any one position or policy. America's youth need Scouting, and by continuing to focus on the goals that unite us we continue to accomplish incredible things for young people and the communities we serve. \" A spokesman for Amazon said in response to the protest that customers can select from nearly a million legally recognized charitable organizations on AmazonSmile. \"We rely on lists published by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to determine if certain organizations are ineligible to participate,\" Ty Rogers said. Tessier said he started gathering signatures through Change.org after learning that the policy for AmazonSmile prohibits organizations that \"engage in, support, encourage, or promote: intolerance, discrimination or discriminatory practices based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age.\" \"We're just asking Amazon to stand by its own policy, and its commitment to the LGBT community,\" Tessier said. On Wednesday, Tessier plans to travel to Seattle to formally petition Amazon.com and its founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post. Tessier said after he graduates from high school he plans to attend college in Ohio. He hopes to continue participating in Boy Scouts - but he's aware of the reality. \"The likelihood of that happening is very slim,\" he said, \"because there is so little time to change so many minds.\"",

        "name": "Local teen calls on Amazon to end support for Boy Scouts over policy on gay leaders; The petition, spearheaded by a local boy scout, calls on the e-commerce giant to stand with LGBT advocates ",
        "content": " Kensington resident Pascal Tessier, 17, emerged last year as the young face of the movement for equal treatment of gays and lesbians within Boy Scouts of America. Now, the Eagle Scout is taking the cause to the world' s largest online retailer, Amazon.com. Tessier has called on the e-commerce giant to bar the Boy Scouts of America from its charitable giving program, AmazonSmile, until the youth service organization permits openly gay men and women to serve in leadership roles. A Change.org petition Tessier created along with Scouts for Equality has garnered more than 124,000 signatures to date. Tessier and his mother, Tracie Felker, plan to fly to Seattle Tuesday morning to hand deliver the petition to Amazon's headquarters. \"Amazon is known for being very progressive. They've been a huge friend to the gay rights movement,\" Tessier said in an interview. \"However they're indirectly supporting discrimination. . .in their charitable giving programs.\" Corporations have faced increasing pressure from customers for their stances on social and political policies. Last month, the newly appointed chief executive for Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox Web browser, resigned after heavy criticism of his contributions to same-sex marriage opponents. Amazon donates 0.5 percent of the price of purchases made through AmazonSmile to an organization of the buyer's choice. But Tessier asserts that including the Boy Scouts of America in that program violates Amazon's policy for eligible organizations. \"It's more asking Amazon to put action to their own words,\" Tessier said. The company's AmazonSmile Participation Agreement states organizations must \"not engage in, support, encourage, or promote: intolerance, discrimination or discriminatory practices based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age.\" \"Customers can select from nearly a million legally recognized 501(c)(3) charitable organizations on AmazonSmile. We rely on lists published by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the US Office of Foreign Assets Control to determine if certain organizations are ineligible to participate,\" Amazon.com spokesman Ty Rogers said via e-mail. Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post and its affiliated publications, previously made a sizeable donation to organizations fighting for marriage equality in Washington state. Same-sex marriage was made legal there in 2012. The Boy Scouts of America has faced mounting pressure from its members and financial backers in recent years to become more inclusive of gay scouts and leaders. The organization reversed a ban on openly gay scouts last year, but continues to exclude gay and lesbian adults from membership. \"I'm trying to change a fine point in their policy,\" Tessier said. \"We're not trying to break it down or influence the gay agenda. We're trying to make it a better place where everyone can feel safe.\" Tessier, a senior at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in Montgomery County, plans to study psychology at The College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio next year. When contacted about the Change.org petition, Boy Scouts of America spokesman Deron Smith issued the following statement: \"Scouting represents millions of youth and adult members in diverse communities across the nation, many of whom have a variety of beliefs on a number of topics. We fully understand and appreciate that not everyone will agree with any one position or policy. Our focus continues to be on working together to deliver the nation's foremost youth program of character development and values-based leadership training. America's youth need Scouting, and by continuing to focus on the goals that unite us we continue to accomplish incredible things for young people and the communities we serve. We are thankful to our volunteers and generous supporters who make that possible.\" Follow reporter Steven Overly on Twitter: @StevenOverly  steven.overly@washpost.com",

        "name": "Tech giants seek competitive edge in cloud computing ",
        "content": " Earlier this month, Hewlett-Packard announced it was investing $1 billion in a new set of Internet cloud-based products, including an open-source software project called OpenStack. In January, IBM committed $1.2 billion to its own cloud division. As investments and competition among Internet cloud providers heat up, tech giants are finding new ways to distinguish their offerings. Amazon, Google and Microsoft recently engaged in a pricing war that drove down the fee for their public cloud services. HP is trying a different tack - emphasizing its open-source approach and encouraging businesses, its main customers, to use its product to create their own cloud services instead of relying on others. Cloud services allow people and companies to store their information in such a way that it is accessible by the Internet, instead of marooned on one machine. Competition is likely tightening in response to increased demand for cloud services from business customers. Spending on cloud services and technology is projected to grow by 25 percent in 2014 to reach more than $100 billion, according to a recent report from the research firm IDC. Toward the end of March, Google senior vice president Urs Holzle announced the company's plan to reduce its cloud services prices by 30 to 85 percent. \"[O]ver the past five years, hardware costs improved by 20-30% annually but public cloud prices fell at just 8% per year,\" Holzle wrote in a blog post for Google. \"The cost of virtualized hardware should fall in line with the cost of the underlying real hardware.\" A day later, Amazon announced it was slashing prices for Amazon Web Services, cutting many of its offerings by 36 to 65 percent, its 42nd drop in price since 2008. The following week, Microsoft said it was slashing prices for its cloud service, Azure, by 35 to 65 percent. \"We recognize that economics are a primary driver for some customers adopting cloud, and stand by our commitment to match prices and be best-in-class on price performance,\" Steven Martin, general manager at Azure, wrote in a blog post in March. For these cloud giants, \"it becomes the race to scale - how many customers can you sign up, and how much are your hardware [costs] going down, that can allow you to scale out,\" said Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom. \"And the idea is initially, you're basically in land-grab mode. \"The way [other] companies are trying to differentiate themselves [is] by layering services . . . or they're trying to offer consulting engagements,\" he said. If they can't compete by slashing prices to gain market share, cloud service providers might start focusing on niche markets, tailoring their software to particular industries, he said. HP, for instance, is focusing on private clouds - cloud networks that businesses use to store their own data and applications, instead of applications that would be used by the public. In early May, HP said it would dedicate $1 billion over the next two years to cloud products and engineering products, renaming all its cloud offerings \"Helion.\" HP Helion includes products based on OpenStack, a version of which it is offering free to customers to test pilots, develop proofs of concept and perform basic production tasks. HP will also help others resell OpenStack-based cloud services. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company plans to provide these services in 20 data centers globally over the next 18 months; it also pledged it will protect customers using OpenStack code from patent and copyright infringement claims related to the code. As part of its most recent investment, HP said it was creating a new practice made up of HP's consultants, engineers and technologists to help customers implement and maintain cloud services. HP's recent announcement, which regrouped its existing and new cloud offerings under Helion, was \"something that [competitors] are already doing, so it's kind of a catch-up and it's what needs to happen,\" Wahlstrom said. For HP, \"cost is just one part of [the] equation\" for business customers, said Bill Hilf, vice president of product management for HP cloud. (Hilf joined HP from Microsoft's Azure division last year.) \"What we hear as critical requirements are security, reliability [and] openness in a hybrid setting that allows enterprises to build the right clouds for their business.\" WP20140519it-cloud0519",

        "name": "Amazon said to play hardball in book contract talks with publishing house Hachette; Dispute between the online retailer and French publisher Hachette draws complaints from agents and authors ",
        "content": " On Thursday, the new bestseller list arrived at the offices of Hachette Book Group with good news: One of the publisher's books, T.D. Jakes's \"Instinct,\" had vaulted to the No. 1 spot. But the bad news was that anyone trying to order the book on Amazon.com on Friday got a message saying that it \"usually ships within 3 to 5 weeks,\" far slower than the fast delivery on which Amazon prides itself. Hachette, which owns Little, Brown; Hyperion; and Grand Central, says that Amazon is deliberately slowing sales of Hachette's books in an effort to pressure the French publisher into agreeing to new contract terms on book pricing. Hachette says there is no shortage of the books. \"We are satisfying all Amazon's orders promptly,\" Hachette said in a statement last week. \"Amazon is holding minimal stock and restocking some of HBG's books slowly, causing 'available 2-4 weeks' messages, for reasons of their own.\" Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post, would not comment for this article. The dispute takes place amid a long-running battle between ever more dominant book retailers and big publishing houses over control of the future shape of the $15 billion book industry. Agents, writers and publishing executives say that Amazon, which by some estimates accounts for half of all book sales, is playing hardball in a contract dispute about how big a discount Hachette will give the giant online retailer and how to set prices for e-books. Book industry leaders say that publishers ordinarily give bookstores discounts of 47 percent to 53 percent on wholesale prices to bolster booksellers' profit margins and leave room for discounts to attract more consumers. But while neither Amazon nor Hachette would comment publicly on their talks, industry officials suspect that Amazon is demanding deeper discounts. When it comes to e-books, publishers have long tried to assert control over prices while Amazon has insisted on a cheaper, more uniform price of $9.99 a book, which book agents say has been lucrative for the publishing houses. It's not the first time Amazon and big publishing houses have fought over terms. The most notable instance was in 2010, when Macmillan resisted Amazon's effort to set all Kindle e-book prices at $9.99. Macmillan wanted some to be priced higher. So Amazon removed the \"buy\" buttons from all active Macmillan titles on its site. \"This one goes along with the pulling of the buy buttons as the most daunting exercise of brute market power,\" said Scott Turow, a Hachette author and former president of the Authors Guild. \"I regard the tactics as incomprehensible, and they are extremely unfair to readers and to authors.\" Turow, a lawyer who has written 11 books, including legal thrillers such as \"Presumed Innocent,\" said that Amazon recently raised the price of his most recent book, \"Identical,\" a move that he said would depress sales. While Turow said the hardback version of his book is near the end of its sales cycle anyway and that a paperback version will be published in July, he said the Amazon sales tactics could hurt other Hachette authors with new releases. Gail Hochman, president of the Association of Authors' Representatives, said the group \"deplores any attempt by any party that would seek to injure and punish innocent authors \u2014 and their innocent readers \u2014 in order to pursue its position in a business dispute. We believe that such actions are analogous to hostage-taking to extort concessions, and are just as indefensible.\" She added, \"This is a brutal and manipulative tactic, ironically from a company that proclaims its goal to fully satisfy the reading needs and desires of its customers and to be a champion of authors.\" Robert Gottlieb, chairman of Trident Media Group, said that he believed negotiations between Amazon and Hachette had intensified in light of the widespread publicity about the dispute, which the New York Times reported on last week. The flap has also revived debates over whether Amazon has too much market power and whether it is violating antitrust laws when it uses its service to pressure publishers into agreeing to its terms. In the past, the Justice Department has been sympathetic to Amazon, whose low prices work to the advantage of consumers. In 2012, Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster signed a consent decree with the Justice Department, which had sued publishers and Apple for conspiring to raise prices of e-books during a series of meals attended by their chief executives at upscale Manhattan restaurants. Under the decree, Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster agreed that they would be prohibited for two years from entering into new agreements that might constrain retailers' ability to offer discounts or other promotions to consumers to encourage the sale of the publishers' e-books. That period expires this fall. Other major publishers, including Macmillan, settled later and have not yet begun negotiating new agreements, industry officials said. Moreover, other book retailers have battled publishers. Barnes & Noble, for example, has pressed publishers for payments in return for prominent shelf space. What makes the dispute between Amazon and Hachette different is that Amazon's tactics have no obvious consumer benefit, a key antitrust consideration. \"What kind of entity in a competitive market would willfully drive customers into the arms of its competitors unless it believes it doesn't really have any competitors?\" Turow said. \"Can you imagine Best Buy refusing to deliver for a period of weeks what's available from its competitors? But Amazon behaves as though they're the only game in town. And increasingly they are. It's a head-scratcher why anyone with regulatory authority would tolerate it. If this is not an example of untoward power, I don't know what is.\" Lawyers say, however, that the key antitrust questions are whether Amazon's actions are hurting consumers and whether Hachette has other outlets. The Jakes book's climb to the top of the bestseller list shows that people have found it elsewhere \u2014 physical bookstores or Barnes & Noble's online site. Moreover, if Amazon were to use deeper discounts to provide low book prices to consumers, then arguably it has helped, not harmed, those consumers. That, Gottlieb noted, would be no different than Wal-Mart pressuring suppliers for lower prices. Health insurers have also used their market power to extract lower prices from drug companies. But Gottlieb said that Amazon's pressure contacts were a \"double-edged sword. Amazon is not just a retailer; they're also a publisher. And the kind of goodwill you create in the industry has an impact on people doing business with you.\" Writers, however, feel caught in the middle. The blockbuster suspense author James Patterson posted his thoughts online: \"Right now, bookstores, libraries, authors, and books themselves are caught in the cross fire of an economic war. If this is the new American way, then maybe it has to be changed \u2014 by law, if necessary \u2014 immediately, if not sooner.\" steven.mufson@washpost.com",

        "name": "Just like big cable, Amazon wants to charge more for access to its pipes ",
        "content": " A few days ago, the New York Times revealed that Amazon had been playing hardball with Hachette, a major New York book publisher with big sellers like Stephen Colbert and Malcolm Gladwell. The e-commerce site wasn't happy with the outcome of contract negotiations, the Times reported, and so has started to suggest other books when customers try to order something from Hachette \u2014 and if they proceed to checkout, the book might take weeks to arrive. Authors, understandably, are irate over the unequal treatment. Even if they have other options, like Barnes & Noble or even their local bookstore, a certain number of people will end up not buying the book at all \u2014 which especially hurts some of the writers who aren't as famous as Gladwell or Colbert. Amazon, which didn't respond to a request for clarification from The Washington Post, is by no means unique in employing this tactic. All big multi-brand retailers choose what to sell in their stores, and when they have enough market power, can extract substantial concessions from the companies whose products they allow in. That's Walmart's whole business model: Require vendors to squeeze as much cost out of their supply chains as possible so they can end up at the lowest price. Even Whole Foods does it, expelling the Greek yogurt brand Chobani when it declined to create \"unique\" options for Whole Foods stores. The problem comes in, however, when the consumer doesn't have other options. That's why people are so upset about the Federal Communications Commission's plan to allow cable companies to charge Internet businesses more for faster access: With only a couple cable providers out there, the Netflixes and YouTubes of the world will have no choice but to pay up, while smaller players could be consigned to slow loading times forever. In some ways, Amazon's decision to choke off Hachette is similar. Wanting to give consumers access to its products through the biggest single pipeline available, Hachette may relent on the price at which it sells books to Amazon, squeezing its slim profit margins even further. As Amazon gains more and more market share, its power to do so will only increase. And as Slate's Jordan Weissman points out, our antitrust law is all geared toward lower prices for consumers, so there's likely nothing Hachette can do about it (unless Amazon, in its now-pressing quest for profit, starts to charge more on top). So, what to make of this? It depends on how you want to think about Amazon as a middleman. If it's just one storefront among many to purchase products, it can cut whatever deals it wants, and you can take your business elsewhere. Increasingly, though, we're starting to see it as an open-access marketplace, on which vendors sell their products directly to consumers \u2014 if there's no real choice of where to buy things, maybe there should be some other way to retain pricing power for those who produce goods in the first place.",

        "name": "Graduates with drone skills are going to be in demand soon. Here\u2019s why. ",
        "content": " Next year around this time, we may be talking about an explosion of interest by employers for recent college grads who know how to operate drones. That's right \u2014 the same way that we currently hear about the IT skills gap in hot areas such as mobile and the cloud and big data \u2014 we may be hearing about the need for IT workers with skills and experience related to drone technology. One key factor is the relentless growth of new business opportunities for drones. It is almost a certainty that the ability to build, pilot and monitor these drones is going to be hugely important once commercial drones get the go-ahead from the FAA. Sure, there are the high-profile business cases \u2014 such as the Amazon retail delivery drones or the Domino's pizza delivery drones \u2014 but there are also everyday use cases that extend from filmmaking and aerial photography to fields such as real estate, farming and pipeline maintenance. Journalists want to work with them. As do meteorologists. And, yes, the Pentagon is definitely interested in the future of drones, too. According to a 2013 report from the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, FAA approval of commercial drones could lead to the creation of 70,000 new U.S. jobs within the next three years, and 100,000 new U.S. jobs by the year 2025. Many of these early jobs, most likely, will be involved in integrating commercial drones into commercial airspace. At any time, there are thousands of commercial aircraft airborne in U.S. airspace, and it's possible that there will be just as many drones within a few short years. Some predict drones to become an $80 billion business opportunity by 2025. Already, we're starting to see the first testing of commercial drones at FAA test sites in places such as New York, North Dakota, Alaska, Nevada, Texas and Virginia. The goal of these new FAA sites is to test out drones in a variety of climates, environments and use cases. The drones in New York, for example, are meant to test out ways to integrate commercial drones into congested Northeastern air space. (So that we avoid incidents like this) And the drones in North Dakota are going to be used to test out approaches related to farming management and agriculture research. To keep up with this projected demand for drone skills, there is now a growing number of official programs and academic opportunities for drone operators. Once companies start hiring, they're probably going to pass on recent engineering grads with a theoretical knowledge of machine propulsion or navigation systems, in favor of candidates with hands-on experience who know how to get a drone airborne from a dead start, and maneuver it around for photos. When Amazon starts hiring drone operators, for example, it probably won't want to build a drone-training program from scratch. Which might explain why we're starting to see some very innovative types of academic programs for the drone technology experts of tomorrow. It's the basic law of supply and demand at work. The Unmanned Vehicle University in Phoenix, for example, can set you up with a variety of career options \u2014 piloting a drone, becoming an aerial drone photographer, or starting a career as a UAV systems engineer. The Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University offers a bachelor's degree in Unmanned Aircraft Systems Science. The University of North Dakota offers a four-year program for future Unmanned Aerial Vehicles pilots, while Kansas State offers an undergraduate degree in Unmanned Aircraft Studies. What's interesting is how all this might change the employment landscape for technology. Most of the big technology employment hubs \u2014 places such as New York and Boston \u2014 thrive on urban density. Entrepreneurs like to cluster together. With drone technology, it's the opposite. Most of the big drone-testing sites are in out-of-the-way locations: North Dakota not New York. Even the test site in New York state is located far from Manhattan or Brooklyn, meaning that Brooklyn hipsters are about to be replaced by upstate rural residents as the arbiters of tech cool. Of course, all this sounds a bit fantastical. North Dakota hopes to eventually become the new Silicon Valley? Really? And there are obviously a lot of safety factors to keep in mind before commercial drones hit the mainstream. Yet, the next time you hear your neighbor talking about buying a Parrot Bebop quadcopter and Oculus Rift VR headset, don't be so quick to dismiss him or her. Getting an early jump on these consumer drone technologies may be the secret to a six-figure job offer later, even if it means moving to a place like Kansas or North Dakota. The same way that tech companies now complain about a lack of talent in areas such as mobile or big data, they may be talking about a drone talent gap within a few years.",

        "content": " As a female executive, Amazon Web Services public sector vice president Teresa Carlson is outnumbered. Especially in the technology field. Carlson, who previously served as vice president of federal government business at Microsoft, said she surprisingly hasn't encountered too many challenges in her 16 years in the technology industry. Instead of fixating on the obstacles for women in tech, Carlson said she hopes more women will focus on how their unique skills could make them competitive in the field. At this year's FOSE conference in Washington \u2014 an annual federal contracting expo drawing executives from the country's largest tech companies \u2014 Carlson and a handful of other female leaders from the public and private sectors plan to discuss the employment outlook for women in technology; their panel is called \"Women Leaders in Technology: Opportunities and Top Issues from IT Leaders.\" According FOSE, in the United States, women held only 25 percent of computing occupations in 2013,citing data from the AFL-CIO. Women's employment growth in science, technology, engineering and mathematics jobs has slowed, according to a Census Bureau report. In 2011, women held 27 percent of computer jobs. Despite the statistics, Carlson said she often speaks to women at universities who are interested in coding and development. Framing technology jobs differently \u2014 emphasizing the group-work aspects of coding, for instance \u2014 could attract more of them to the field, she said. \"Women and young girls are very social. They like problem solving. Information technology can really allow them to come together, crowd source, solve problems together and take on world issues. I believe that's going to be a huge driver of more women moving into an IT career,\" Carlson said. Lisa Schlosser, the Office of Management and Budget's deputy associate administrator for the Office of E-Government and Information Technology, noted that women are making progress in the public sector: The federal government has at least eight female chief information officers, and the majority of the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity division is female, she said. But, she said, \"We still have a long way to go. And if I look in general at the landscape, you're still around 14 percent of top corporate executive jobs held by women.\" And the gender-pay gap still persists, she said. \"As a society, we have to start this new paradigm where we start early with girls in schools \u2014 all the way from toddlers on up \u2014 and engage them and get them excited [about] the sciences, in technology, in math, in leadership programs. I think you see a lot of girls not wanting to step up.\" She said it is important to encourage girls to network with powerful women, and make strong professional connections. \"Historically, I think men have done a great job in building relationships, in networking, from the time they're young throughout their career.\" The public and private sectors face the same problems attracting women to technology fields, Schlosser said, and for each, the solutions are the same. \"We're trying to put in place strategic programs to get more kids in general involved with [science, technology, engineering and math], and then encourage women to do that. I think that will open doors within the government and the private sector.\" Also scheduled to speak on the panel are NSA Director of the Information Assurance Directorate Debora Plunkett, Small Business Administration Chief Information Officer and Chief Privacy Officer Renee Macklin, and Experian President of Public Sector Business Barbara Rivera. Morris Jones, anchor and host of weekly ABC television show Government Matters, will moderate. FOSE 2014 runs Tuesday through Thursday of this week at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center.",

        "content": " Alibaba's plans to file for an initial public offering has Wall Street investors cheering. But the company's foray into the U.S. stock market could also be a boon for Silicon Valley. Alibaba is expected to raise as much as $20 billion in its debut, which would make it one of the biggest tech IPOs in history, surpassing Facebook's record of $16 billion in 2012. The additional cash would give the firm more resources to shore up its presence in the American tech industry, analysts say. In recent years, the Chinese e-commerce giant has used its massive fortune to invest in several Bay Area start-ups, including ShopRunner, a subscription service similar to Amazon Prime, and Lyft, a ride-sharing service featuring cars with pink mustaches that competes with Uber. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) The company, which controls about 80 percent of China's e-commerce market, is in no hurry to compete directly with Amazon and other online retailers in the United States, industry observers say. But its investments in the tech space are part of a long-term expansion strategy, they say. Should Alibaba decide to enter the U.S. market tomorrow, it would face several challenges, analysts say. The company's experience is limited to emerging markets such as China, where it dominates the online shopping landscape. \"As a foreign company, it's hard for them to understand the U.S. market,\" said Yan Anthea Zhang, a professor at Rice University's Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business. \"Alibaba cannot simply duplicate its business models here.\" Instead, the retailer is using its investments to learn about the U.S. market and experiment with different kinds of businesses, she said. That's also why, unlike its acquisition spree in China, Alibaba has been content to buy small stakes in U.S. start-ups, Zhang said. Ahead of its IPO, Alibaba bought controlling stakes in several Chinese companies including AutoNavi, an online navigation company, and Intime Retail, a Chinese department store. But in the United States, Alibaba is one of several backers for smaller specialty e-commerce sites, such as 1stdibs.com, a Web site for antiques and luxury items, and the soon-to-be-launched 11Main.com, which will sell goods from boutique stores. There's another advantage that investing in Silicon Valley holds for the retailer \u2014 a quick inroad into new technology. Alibaba wants to invest in innovation, said Reena Aggarwal, a professor of finance at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, who has researched IPOs extensively. \"Many of the innovative companies that fit well with Alibaba's model of e-commerce are based in the U.S.,\" she said. \"They're just going after the best technology.\" Alibaba is estimated to be worth $150 billion to $200 billion, bigger than either Amazon or eBay, but behind Apple, Google and Microsoft. The company has a range of businesses \u2014 including an online payment service, a money market fund and a cloud-computing operation. \"Alibaba is a business empire and in the long term, its size will give it an advantage,\" said Zhang, the Rice University professor. But in the short term, she said, a successful IPO will give Alibaba something it takes for granted in China \u2014 brand recognition.",

Amazon will soon roll out its own private fleet of trucks to make more same-day deliveries. Google is hot on its heels, planning to expand its own same-day delivery service. Uber is starting to push into the arena, too. Delivery is hot right now, but how do you know whether it's right for your business? And if it is the right move, where do you start? Here are some tips for small business owners. Determining whether delivery is right for you As you're considering implementing delivery into your business model, consider the following questions to help you make an informed decision. Are my competitors delivering? If they are, how are they doing it? Is there a demand? What are they charging? Try a service for yourself by ordering from a competitor and being a critic. Take notes on what went well, what didn't and how you could improve it. If they aren't offering delivery, find out why. Are insurance costs too high? Have they tried and failed? Pretend to be a customer, and call to ask for delivery. Then, ask whether they're considering doing it in the future. The answers could be enlightening. How will I differentiate my services? If everyone else in your space is delivering, what will be your differentiator? Maybe your drivers will dress in tuxedos or use advanced technology, or maybe you will provide a small gift to each of your customers. Choose something they won't soon forget. Preparing to take your products to doorsteps Starting a new delivery service may seem daunting, if you decide to go that route. However, there are some steps you can take to make the progression easier: Start small. You can always expand your delivery zone later, but starting small will help ensure the quality of your service. As you become more established, you're more likely to be able to expand without sacrificing quality. Appoint a head of delivery. Whether it's the business owner or another employee, someone needs to own the delivery experience for the customer, from start to finish. All compliments, complaints and questions must go to a single point of contact so you can accurately track the experiment. Set clear expectations with staff. The delivery staff that brings your product to the customer is the only in-person interaction the customer will have with your company. Train one delivery driver at a time, then release that driver to train another. Carefully building your delivery team ensures quality and consistency. Use the first five seconds to your advantage. The first five seconds of the customer's interaction with your service is critical. Train your staff to smile, provide a proper greeting, and say \"thank you\" to every customer. Survey and solicit feedback. If the same customer orders from you over and over again, reach out and see if you can ask him or her a few questions about your new delivery program. Often, customers have a unique perspective and will be glad to share it. Remember, it's all about saving your customers time. If you decide to offer delivery, it's not just about bringing a milk container to the customer \u2014 it's a 15-minute errand that was keeping that person from doing something else. When you deliver to your customers' front doors, you can help them reclaim their time for more meaningful activities \u2014 and that can help your company stand out.

        "name": "Microsoft wisely hops on the moonshot bandwagon ",
        "content": " For large tech companies nothing is sexier right now than moonshots. These grandiose, daring plans attract positive news stories, make the company more desirable to potential hires and excite investors who may buy more stock. Amazon has received plenty of free publicity and interest for its talk of delivering packages with drones. Monday, Google held the spotlight with the latest development in its self-driving car. The company has cleverly lifted the curtain ever so slightly on its once secretive innovations lab (Google X), because it knows positive stories will be published. Facebook turned heads when it bought Oculus Rift \u2014 the maker of virtual-reality technology that appears to have absolutely no connection to Facebook's core business. But chief executive Mark Zuckerberg talks of using virtual reality to help billions worldwide share spaces and experiences. Some of these companies' moonshots will certainly fail, but the excitement and buzz they generate is worth it. Amazon, Google and Facebook all have something else in common \u2014 a higher price-to-earnings ratio than Microsoft. A high price-to-earning ratio indicates that investors expect a company to grow, so they will pay a premium to own stock in it. It's worth noting that the other tech giant, Apple, which is notoriously tight-lipped about its upcoming plans, has a low price-to-earnings ratio comparable to Microsoft. When you aren't hyping your next innovation, investors aren't going to be convinced you will grow. The recent narrative on Microsoft isn't one of remarkable world-changing ideas and innovation. It was late to embrace smartphones and tablets, and must cling to the Windows and Office businesses. Former chief executive Steve Ballmer was memorably skeptical of the iPhone's potential (It's since gone on to be arguable the most successful product ever). But with a new chief executive in Satya Nadella, Microsoft has a perfect opening to prove to the world it can still innovate. For the past 10 years Microsoft's stock has trailed the S&P 500 index. It's not the remarkable growth company it was during the '90s. In fairness, part of the challenge is just how big it is. For a company with a market cap of $337 billion to grow significantly is much harder than for a smaller company. Google has run into the problem of the law of large numbers \u2014 its market cap is similar to Microsoft's \u2014 yet it remains a company that is seen to have a bright and growing future. Google has branched off into potential growth areas, gobbling up robot companies and developing a self-driving car. Most still see Microsoft as the company of Office and Windows. But Microsoft may be fixing that as it gets into the moonshot game. It's long had Microsoft Research, home to 1,100 scientists and engineers, yet their work hasn't been fawned over like what happens at Google X. New branding may change that. A recent job listing mentions a \"Special Projects\" team within Microsoft Research that would work \"on disruptive technologies that could benefit the company and society.\" Another posting describes the team as \"a new startup group focused on disruptive next-generation technologies.\" That all sounds quite a bit like what Google chief executive Larry Page says when he explains why disruptive companies can be more valuable to society than traditional charities. ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley has reported that Norman Whitaker, a former program manager at DARPA, will lead the Special Projects team. Given DARPA's track record, it's easy to see excitement over what his new team could dream up. It's unclear if the Special Projects group will pull off anything special. But if its high-minded goals could win the hearts of investors and potential employees, that will go a long way toward returning Microsoft to its glory years.",

        "content": " Amazon has launched a new online store specifically for wearable technology, the company announced Tuesday. The new site features wearable devices such as fitness trackers, healthcare devices, cameras and so-called \"smart watches\" that can run mobile apps, among other technologies, from brands including Samsung, Jawbone and GoPro. Later, the store may include devices from Narrative, which builds a small, wearable camera, and Bionym, a tech company developing a device that uses the wearer's electro-cardiogram to validate a person's identity. \"Wearable technology is an exciting category with rapid innovation and our customers are increasingly coming to Amazon to shop and learn about these devices,\" John Nemeth, Amazon's director of wireless and mobile electronics, said in a statement. The new store will include buying-guides and product reviews. (Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) The launch comes a few days after Amazon's stock plummeted about 9 percent on Friday, following an earnings report for the first quarter of the 2014 fiscal year.

        "content": " It may not be the definitive signal that wearable tech has finally arrived, but Amazon.com's announcement that it has added a separate section on its Web site just for wearable technology does show the category is gaining visibility. The Amazon section is designed to educate as well as move merchandise, according to a release announcing the new online department. \"We're thrilled to bring our customers a store with the largest selection and great prices that helps eliminate the guesswork when deciding which wearable devices best fit their needs \u2014 whether that is tracking activity, staying connected through smart watches or capturing their next adventure with wearable cameras,\" said John Nemeth, Amazon's director of wireless and mobile electronics. (Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Wearable technology has become a prime focus for many major tech companies, from Google to Microsoft and (at least in rumor) Apple. In fact, Mashable reported on Tuesday that Apple was recently awarded a new patent for a head-mounted display that appears to resemble the virtual Rift goggles made by Oculus, the firm Facebook recently bought for $2 billion. But while there's been a lot of attention paid to what Google is doing with Glass or what Microsoft is planning with its big push into the Internet of Things, it's easy to forget that there are a slew of smaller companies devoted to making specialized, wearable tech. And all are fighting for visibility. The dedicated online store offers a wider look at that world, showing the products that are already on the market and highlighting more than just the fitness trackers that have, thus far, been the category's biggest standout. The site arranges health-care devices, wearable cameras, trackers and smart watches into principal sub-categories. It also features explanatory articles, educational videos and buying guides to help customers navigate through the new products. With the new section, Amazon has positioned itself as a platform for introducing the latest pieces of wearable technology. To kick off the site, for example, the retailer is offering an exclusive deal to pre-order the Misfit Bloom necklace, an $80 necklace that works with the Misfit Shine fitness tracker. While tech companies appear pretty excited about wearables, consumers have indicated that they need a little more convincing. In a survey published by Nielsen last month, 70 percent of American respondents said they were aware of wearable tech, while only 15 percent said they currently use some form of wearable tech in their daily lives. Nearly half of those who responded to the survey said that they were interested in buying a piece of wearable technology but that factors such as price and aesthetics -- 53 percent said that they wanted the tech to look more like jewelry -- were in the way.",

Amazon.com dropped 6.5 percent after predicting an operating loss in the current quarter, contributing to a 0.5 percent slide in the Nasdaq Composite Index. Phone stocks sank on concerns that price competition will hurt profits. Apple jumped 9 percent for its best week since August as the company sold more iPhones than forecast. Allergan Inc. surged 26 percent after Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. offered to merge with the maker of the Botox wrinkle treatment. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to 1863.40 in the week, following its best rally since July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 47.08 points, or 0.3 percent, to 16,361.46.

Geopolitical tensions contributed to the final-day selloff, after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that he is running out of time to ease tension in Ukraine. The Treasury will sell $25 billion in three-month bills and $23 billion in six-month bills on April 28. They yielded 0.025 percent and 0.050 percent, respectively, in when-issued trading.

        "content": " The stock market fell sharply Friday, dragged down by disappointing quarterly results from Amazon and Ford Motor. Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia over Ukraine also weighed on the market. Worried investors sold their risky assets and moved into the traditional havens: bonds, gold and stocks that pay high dividends such as utilities. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 15.21 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1863.40. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 140.19 points, or 0.9 percent, to 16,361.46, and the Nasdaq composite lost 72.78 points, or 1.8 percent, to 4075.56. Friday's sell-off was enough to push the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq into the red for the week. Technology stocks, which have been volatile for the past two months, were once again a hotbed of selling. Amazon, the world's largest online store, sank $33.32, or 10 percent, to $303.83. Amazon reported late Thursday an increase in first-quarter profit, but the company also said that spending on investments will probably lead to an operating loss in the second quarter. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) The retail giant dragged the rest of the technology sector lower, making it one of the worst-performing sectors in the S&P 500. Netflix fell more than 6 percent, Priceline lost 5 percent, Facebook fell 5 percent and Twitter lost more than 7 percent. Investors have had little patience for companies missing their forecasts this quarter, said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. Ford fell 54 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $15.78 after the company reported earnings that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Worldwide sales rose 6 percent in the first quarter, but the automotive company reported a sales drop in North America that cut into the firm's profit. General Motors fell 45 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $33.72. The U.S. government on Friday filed criminal and civil charges accusing a former executive of insider trading in advance of eBay's purchase of his e-commerce company. The case against Christopher Saridakis, 45, is also notable because it marks the first time the Securities and Exchange Commission reached a so-called non-prosecution agreement with an individual, an unnamed trader who it said provided \"early, extraordinary and unconditional\" cooperation. Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia charged Saridakis, who led the marketing solutions division of GSI Commerce, in a so-called criminal information with securities fraud for leaking material nonpublic information in March 2011 about eBay's plan to buy his company. Investigators said the resident of Greenville, Del., encouraged two relatives and two friends to trade on his tips, leading to more than $300,000 of illegal profits. GSI shares rose nearly 51 percent March 28, 2011, after eBay, the online retailer, announced its $1.96 billion purchase of the King of Prussia, Pa.-based company. The SEC said Saridakis agreed to pay $664,822 and accept an officer and director ban to settle its charges. The cooperating defendant and five other people agreed to pay more than $490,000 to settle related SEC charges. Three of these defendants got lessened penalties because they cooperated with the regulator. l U.S. consumer sentiment rose in April to a nine-month high as views on current and near-term conditions surged, a survey released Friday showed. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final April reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 84.1, beating an expectation of 83.0 in a Reuters survey and up from 80.0 the month before. The preliminary April reading was 82.6. The headline number was the highest reading since July 2013. \"Perhaps the more important question is whether consumer confidence will show greater resistance to the backslides that have repeatedly occurred in the past few years,\" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. \"Resilience is dependent on positive long term economic expectations.\" l A U.S. appeals court will consider Apple's request to delay a July trial to determine how much the iPad maker must pay in damages to customers in more than two dozen states over e-book price fixing. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit said that a three-judge panel will hear Apple's argument on why the trial should be put on hold while it appeals a judge's ruling that it conspired with five publishers to raise e-book prices. U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in New York had denied Apple's request to postpone the trial on Wednesday. Cote ruled last year after a nonjury trial that Apple had conspired with the publishers in an effort to impede competitors such as Amazon. l A federal judge on Friday approved the November settlement between the U.S. government and the airlines that merged to form American Airlines Group, the world's biggest carrier. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said the settlement, which required American to sell takeoff and landing rights at airports in the New York and Washington areas and airport gates in five other cities, was \"within the reaches of the public interest.\" She said a hearing was not needed. l A Delaware judge has ruled that Philadelphia's two largest newspapers will be sold at an ascending-bid auction open only to insiders. The decision Friday is a victory for majority owner George Norcross in his fight for control of the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News. Norcross and fellow investor Lewis Katz have been locked in a fight over how to run the company, prompting the latest sale. Both men have pledged to open with a starting bid of $77 million. The local newspaper guild had hoped to bid with backing from an investor, but said this week it would not match that opening bid. WP20140426digest0426",

        "content": " LivingSocial earned $177 million in net income during the first quarter compared to a $45 million loss during the same period a year ago, according to a filing by Amazon.com, which owns 31 percent of the District daily deals company. The positive showing for LivingSocial is largely due to the $260 million sale of its South Korean subsidiary, Ticket Monster, to Chicago-based Groupon in January. LivingSocial netted $205 million on the sale. The company reported revenue of $77 million, which is down from the $108 million it recorded during the first quarter of 2013, according to the filing. The company has yet to turn a profit, and its valuation of around $300 million is a fraction of what it was two years ago.

        "content": " Amazon's first-quarter profit rose 18 percent as shoppers continued to flock to the online mega retailer to buy goods. Amazon has long focused on spending the money it makes to grow its business and expand into new areas, such as streaming content, e-readers and even grocery delivery. On Thursday, it launched Prime Pantry, a grocery-delivery service for Prime members. And earlier this month, it introduced its first set-top video-streaming box called Amazon Fire, which sells for $99. \"We get our energy from inventing on behalf of customers, and 2014 is off to a kinetic start,\" said chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post. Although investors have largely given Amazon a pass for focusing on growth and investing rather than turning a strong profit, Amazon has been making some moves lately to strengthen its bottom line. It boosted the annual fee for its Prime two-day-shipping membership program to $99 from $79 in March to offset higher shipping costs. Shipping costs rose 31 percent, to $1.83 billion, during the quarter. And to entice more people to sign up for the service at the $99 price, which includes its streaming-video service, on Wednesday the retailer said it inked a deal with HBO to stream some of its older shows online beginning May 21. The news was a coup for Amazon. HBO has steadfastly refused to license its programming to other streaming services. Net income for the quarter rose to $108 million, or 23 cents per share. That compares with net income of $82 million, or 18 cents per share last year. Analysts expected 21 cents per share. Revenue rose 23 percent, to $19.74 billion. Analysts expected $19.42 billion. Even with the turbulence of severe winter storms and stubbornly high fuel prices, many of the major airlines are cruising, and their stock prices are rising. On Thursday, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines reported record profits for the first quarter, usually the weakest time of year for the airlines. That followed a rousing report from Delta Air Lines a day earlier. Still stuck on the tarmac: United Airlines, which lost $609 million during the first three months of the year. Its shares fell nearly 10 percent, to $41.53. Revenue for every seat flown one mile, a key measure in the airline business, fell 2 percent, which United blamed mostly on canceled flights. The same figure rose 3 percent at American Airlines Group, the company formed by December's merger of American and US Airways. That helped American swing to a $480 million profit, a record for American for the usually weak first quarter, as revenue rose 6 percent. American's shares were up 0.5, percent to $37.26. Southwest Airlines also set a first-quarter record with its profit of $152 million, more than doubling the year-ago number despite 7,500 weather-related flight cancellations that the company said reduced profit by $50 million. Its shares gained 0.8 percent, to $24.27. JetBlue Airways reported a profit despite weather cancellations that helped send net income down about 71 percent, to $4 million, or a penny per share. Its shares closed down 2.6 percent, to $8.37. On Wednesday, Delta said it canceled more than 17,000 flights in January and February and still beat expectations with a $213 million profit. Its stock closed down 1 percent, to $36.73. l Netflix reached an agreement with three cable companies that, for the first time, will let U.S. subscribers watch the streaming-video service as though it were an ordinary cable channel. The deal will make all Netflix content available to subscribers nationwide on RCN, Grande Communications and Atlantic Broadband. Altogether, the agreement covers as many as 500,000 of the cable firms' existing subscribers - though that figure could grow as more customers sign up. l Facebook acquired the startup behind the popular fitness tracking app Moves. Facebook said it bought ProtoGeo Oy, the Finnish company behind the app, for an undisclosed sum. The Moves app has been downloaded 4 million times on Android phones and iPhones. It lets people automatically track their runs, walks or bike rides and plots their routes on a map. l Microsoft's push into cloud computing, which is accelerating under new chief executive Satya Nadella, paid off in the fiscal third quarter. Net income in the period that ended March 31 was $5.66 billion, or 68 cents a share, Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft said. That topped the average analyst estimate of 63 cents. Sales were $20.4 billion. l Earnings: Burger King Worldwide, Ford Motor. WP20140425digest0425",

",
        "content": " Amazon.com and HBO announced Wednesday that they've locked up a deal to put some of the premium cable channel's most iconic shows on Amazon's Prime Video service. The shows will start appearing on the service from May 21, the companies said in a release. Before you get too excited, you should know HBO isn't giving away its whole catalog: It's up to HBO to decide which shows will be available on Prime, and shows will only become part of the Prime trove three years after their initial airing. So \"Game of Thrones\" fans, for example, won't have access to those early days when their favorite characters were single and alive as part of the deal announced Wednesday. But the catalog of shows is still solid, with offerings such as the full runs of \"The Sopranos,\" \"The Wire\" and even select seasons of newer shows such as \"Boardwalk Empire\" and \"True Blood.\" Over time, early seasons of other shows such as \"Girls,\" \"The Newsroom\" and \"Veep\" will make their way onto the service. This is the first time that HBO has allowed its shows to be streamed to those who don't have a subscription -- or, at least, a subscriber's username and password. The companies did not announce how much the deal was worth. Nor did they say how long consumers can count on getting HBO through Amazon Prime, saying only that this is a \"multi-year\" deal. Still, it's a huge win for Amazon and its Prime service, which the company has been heavily investing in as it looks to take on Netflix and Hulu Plus. Amazon has made it a point to tout its exclusive deals -- the company recently got the streaming rights to \"24\" -- and even claims to have passed Hulu and Apple TV in streaming video usage. Amazon also had to act quickly to justify that a Prime subscription -- which also includes free two-day shipping on many items -- is worth getting, after raising the price to $99 from $79 to offset rising shipping costs. Here's the full list of shows available as part of the deal, according to the release: All seasons of revered classics such as \"The Sopranos,\" \"The Wire,\" \"Deadwood,\" \"Rome\" and \"Six Feet Under,\"and of recent favorites such as \"Eastbound & Down,\" \"Enlightened\"and \"Flight of the Conchords.\" Epic miniseries, including \"Angels in America,\" \"Band of Brothers,\" \"John Adams,\" \"The Pacific\" and \"Parade's End\" Select seasons of current series such as \"Boardwalk Empire,\" \"Treme\" and \"True Blood\" Hit original movies like \"Game Change,\" \"Too Big To Fail\" and \"You Don't Know Jack\" Pedigreed documentaries including the \"Autopsy\" and \"Iceman\" series, \"Ghosts of Abu Ghraib\" and \"When the Levees Broke\" Hilarious original comedy specials from Lewis Black, Ellen DeGeneres, Louis CK and Bill Maher The announcement also said that HBO Go, the network's app that lets subscribers watch current and past shows on multiple devices, will be coming to Amazon's new Fire TV set-top box by the end of the year.",

        "content": " Amazon.com and HBO announced Wednesday that they have locked up a deal to put some of the premium cable channel's most iconic shows on Amazon's Prime Video service. But don't get too excited. HBO isn't giving away its whole catalogue: It will pick select shows to make available on Prime, and those programs will not become part of the Prime trove until three years after they have aired. So \"Game of Thrones\" fans, for example, won't have access to those days when their favorite characters were single and alive. But the catalogue of shows is still solid, with offerings such as the full runs of \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Wire\" and even select seasons of newer shows such as \"Boardwalk Empire\" and \"True Blood.\" Over time, early seasons of other shows such as \"Girls,\" \"The Newsroom\" and \"Veep\" will make their way onto the service. This is the first time HBO has allowed its shows to be streamed to those who don't have a subscription - or, at least, a subscriber's user name and password. The shows will start appearing on the service May 21, the companies said in a statement. Amazon and HBO did not say how much the deal was worth. Nor did they reveal how long consumers can count on getting HBO through Amazon Prime, saying only that this is a \"multi-year\" deal. Still, it's a huge win for Amazon and its Prime service, which the company has been heavily investing in as it looks to take on Netflix and Hulu Plus. Amazon has made it a point to tout its exclusive deals - the company recently got the streaming rights to \"24.\" Amazon also had to act quickly to justify the rising price of a Prime subscription, which includes free two-day shipping on many items.

        "name": "Book by economist becomes a surprise Amazon bestseller ",
        "content": " The new book by economist Thomas Piketty, \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century,\" is a runaway hit, perched at the top of Amazon.com's bestsellers chart and temporarily sold out on the Web site. The book has sold about 48,000 hardcover copies and 8,000 to 9,000 e-book versions, according to Susan Donnelly, sales and marketing director at Harvard University Press, the publisher behind the English-language version. (The book was written in French and released in France last year.) Presses are cranking it out in the United States, India and Britain, and the book is in at least its fourth run. Even though the book was a hit in its native France, it's just now taking off among English readers around the world, Donnelly said. She expects that sales in China, Hong Kong and Japan will also soon follow. Piketty, widely cited for his work on income inequality, has clearly touched a nerve. Many societies around the world are grappling with a growing gap between rich and poor, especially in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and the issue has become politically charged. Piketty's book has made waves because it argues that the underlying mechanisms of capitalism tend toward massive inequality. He writes that the era between 1930 and 1975 - often hailed for the way in which wealth was broadly shared - was actually a departure from the norm. That period of economic growth, he says, was the result of unusual circumstances such as World War II, a global depression and the government's actions in the aftermath of those events: strong policies raising taxes and increasing regulation. But now, with many of those policies rolled back, societies are reverting back to extreme inequality. The unlikely bestseller, clocking in at almost 700 pages, is serving as an interesting case study for modern book publishing. One of the hallmarks of the book's success is that it is sold out on Amazon, even though a digital version is available on Kindle, too. (The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos.) \"You can have it on your e-book reader, but that's not the same as having the book,\" Donnelly said. \"I'm not saying this book is a Tiffany's bag, but nobodygoes to Tiffany's and buys something and doesn't get that little blue bag. I think there's still some of that about books.\" Another possible factor is that the Kindle version retails for nearly as much as the hardcover on Amazon. The digital book is $21.99; the hardcover costs $24.76. The book is poised to become the most popular ever for Harvard University Press, better known for serious intellectual tomes than for bestsellers. Piketty's book has sold 57,000 copies after only a few weeks. By comparison, the publisher's last two successes sold 60,000 each in their first year, Donnelly said. She predicts that Piketty's book will become akin to another classic for the publisher, John Rawls's \"A Theory of Justice.\" \"It's going in that small cluster of books that makes a real contribution to intellectual and moral discussions in our day,\" she said. Donnelly added that even though the book is sold out on Amazon, copies can be bought directly from the publisher. Excerpted from Wonkblog at washingtonpost.com/wonkblog. WP20140423piketty0423",

        "content": " Slate on Monday announced a new subscription model that it wants to be super sure you know is not a paywall . Called Slate Plus, it keeps most content available for free, but offers subscribers bonuses such as online chats with reporters. The subscribers will pay $5 a month or $50 a year. The bonuses also include discounts or special seats at Slate events and early access to some articles. \"It's not a paywall,\" David Plotz, the editor of the online magazine, wrote in a post announcing the service -- twice. \"Our model is Amazon Prime, which just keeps on adding benefits,\" he wrote. Amazon Prime, which started as a membership program that offered free shipping on most orders for an annual flat fee, has added new features including streaming video and an e-book lending library since its inception -- and only raised the price once in nine years . Readers may remember that this very outlet, The Washington Post, was bought by Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos last year. But not every publication owned by what was then The Washington Post Co., now Graham Holdings, was part of the deal. Some properties, including Slate and Foreign Policy, were left out. It's no secret that media outlets have struggled to figure out how best to monetize their content -- arguably, that's what led to The Washington Post's sale in the first place. And Slate, like many sites, has primarily relied on advertising since its inception as one of the earliest online only outlets nearly 18 years ago. \"And while advertising remains central to our success, we think we'd be better off if we were less dependent on it,\" writes Plotz. \"We also think it's important to give readers a stake in the journalism they value.\" Slate is far from the first online media outlet to give a subscription model a try, but many including The Post and the New York Times use a paywall that kicks in after a set number of visits per month to encourage regular readers to sign up. In fact, Slate tried out a more traditional subscription model along those lines in the late 1990s, before the outlet was sold to The Washington Post Co. by Microsoft in 2004. But perhaps the most direct analogue to Slate's new set up is Talking Point Memo's membership program, which is known as TPM Prime.",

        "content": " Amazon.com's big entry into the entertainment market came earlier this month in the form of the Fire TV -- a set-top box that brings video from its own service and those of its partners to your living room. Unified voice search is the key way that Amazon plans to distinguish itself from the Apple TVs, Roku boxes and Chromecasts of the world, because it offers a simple way to sift through the thousands of titles offered on the service. In fact, this was the main selling point in its first commercial, a bizarre spot starring Gary Busey happily talking to inanimate objects. But the reality fell short of the promise, at least in the initial release window. The lack of voice search integration into other apps on the Fire TV was a main criticism many people -- including yours truly -- raised about the set-top box in initial reviews of the product. On Thursday, the company announced that it would be extending the device's voice search capabilities to a handful of third-party apps including Hulu Plus, Crackle and Showtime's app, Showtime Anytime, starting this summer. These three apps will join Vevo, which already allowed users to search for content by simply speaking into Amazon's remote. Amazon's own service, of course, also works with the voice search feature. If Amazon continues to add the capability to the catalog of apps already signed on to its platform -- particularly big partners such as Netflix or YouTube -- that will help it a lot as it battles the likes of Apple, Roku and Microsoft to control the living room. This announcement shows that while Fire TV still needs time to grow into all of its promises, Amazon seems to be moving at a good pace to improve the device.",

        "name": "Why more companies should pay employees to quit ",
        "content": " Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos's move to do just that is getting a lot of attention, with coverage of the unusual human resources practice showing up everywhere from the Post to Time to USA Today last week after it was shared in his annual letter to shareholders. (Disclosure: Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) It's gotten so much attention in part because the practice is indeed pretty rare. Zappos, which Amazon acquired in 2009, has long made what it calls \"The Offer\" to its employees, saying to new workers that the company will pay them $2,000 to leave if they're not interested in staying. But while some companies may have adopted the practice since, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh's unusual management approach was so novel that when the Harvard Business Review wrote about it back in 2008, it quickly became one of the most popular posts on the site. (The Zappos offer started at just $100 but has risen over the years; Amazon offers its fulfillment center employees $2,000 the first year the offer is made and raises the offer by $1,000 each year until it reaches $5,000.) But it shouldn't be so progressive or extraordinary when you stop and think about it. The most basic reason is also the most obvious one. As Bezos wrote in his shareholder letter, \"the goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and think about what they really want. In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they don't want to be isn't healthy for the employee or the company.\" The idea, in a sense, is to bribe people who don't love working there, don't feel they're a fit for the culture, or don't really like what they're doing with money to head for the exits. (An e-mail to Amazon to confirm details of the program was not immediately answered.) Five thousand dollars here and there, after all, isn't that much when compared with what disengaged people can cost a company's bottom line. Gallup has shown that companies that have 9.3 \"engaged\" employees (those who are emotionally connected with their jobs and willing to go above and beyond) for every one \"disengaged\" employee saw 147 percent higher earnings per share on average in 2011-2012 when compared with their competitors. Meanwhile, employers with just 2.6 happy workers for every unhappy one saw earnings per share that was 2 percent lower than their competitors. Gallup estimates that \"active disengagement\" costs the United States $450 billion to $550 billion each year. But that's not the only reason the idea is something more companies should adopt. For one, it has the potential to improve hiring upfront. If managers have to budget for a $5,000 quitting bonus for employees who don't stick around for the long haul, they might be more careful about truly hiring for fit rather than simply for a warm body. That's particularly the case for high-growth companies such as Zappos or Amazon that are experiencing very rapid expansion. At the same time, it could also save companies both risk and cost later on. Employers could potentially pay more than $2,000 or $5,000 in severance if they decided to lay off those disengaged workers in the future, rather than motivating them to leave of their own accord. They also risk fewer termination-related lawsuits if more of their workers choose to leave on their own. And that's just the tangible costs. If more disengaged folks are leaving on their own accord, rather than having to be pushed out in layoffs, there's less risk to employee morale. Layoffs are spirit-crushing events in any organization, even when they seem fair to the survivors and the good performers who are left behind. Avoiding more of them by encouraging the less devoted to leave earlier could take some of that risk away. But probably the biggest benefit for a company to adopt the practice is that it shows all employees -- especially the really good performers or most dedicated ones -- that it's serious about protecting its culture. It doesn't want people around who don't value the place, and it doesn't want people who don't love their jobs. And to prove it, it's willing to put its money behind it.

        "content": " There's no doubt about it, says Josh Dinneen: More Americans want packages delivered as quickly as possible. The growing appetite for same- and next-day delivery, popularized by services such as Amazon Prime, has been good for Vienna-based LaserShip, where Dinneen is senior vice president of commercial strategy. The company, which specializes in what is called \"last-mile deliveries\" along the East Coast, is looking to expand to the Midwest by early 2015. \"We're going for speed,\" Dinneen said. \"We're not picking up packages in Seattle and bringing them over to D.C. We're typically staying within the time zone, and we're able to do things faster than national competitors in many cases.\" The company was founded in 1986 as a document delivery service. These days, a network of trucks transports items \u2014 most commonly online purchases, but also items such as office supplies, medical equipment and wholesale pharmaceuticals \u2014 to different parts of the region. An online order that is fulfilled in Boston, for example, might be picked up by LaserShip and delivered to a home in Washington. \"We started as a local point-to-point service, and today we're delivering hundreds of thousands of packages a day to consumers across the East Coast,\" Dinneen said. \"It's been a very dynamic change for us. LaserShip has continue to spread on the East Coast. Last month, the company begin delivering to New Hampshire, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Delaware, expanding its service area by 44 percent and reaching an additional 8.5 million customers. Dinneen would not disclose revenue or profit figures, but said the company's annual revenue grew by double digits last year. The e-commerce delivery business, the largest part of the company's business, grew more than 30 percent in 2013. Even so, the regional shipping industry comprises a small fraction of the $32 billion ground transportation industry. Last year, for example, regional shippers brought in a total of about $650 million in annual revenue, according to SJ Consulting Group, a transportation and logistics research firm. LaserShip landed in the small parcel business in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom. In 1999, the company partnered with Barnes & Noble to provide same-day shipping services in New York City. Today, LaserShip counts Amazon.com, Office Depot and Staples among its clients. (The Washington Post, including Capital Business, is owned by Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos.) \"Anybody who is an online retailer is either a customer or a target customer for us,\" Dinneen said. While business-to-consumer services make up the bulk of LaserShip's business, the company also provides global deliveries of items such as donor organs, tissues and blood through a facility in Chantilly, Dinneen said. The company partners with a number of national air carriers, including American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, to coordinate deliveries. \"Sometimes a hospital in California will say, 'We need that tissue tonight,'\" Dinneen said. \"That kind of service has to be immediate. If it means chartering a jet, that's what we'll do.\" The company has more than 1,000 employees, not including delivery personnel, and reaches an estimated 70 million customers along the East Coast, Dinneen said.d Last summer, LaserShip expanded service to North Carolina and parts of Florida with the opening of new facilities in Jacksonville, Orlando and Charlotte. \"There is increasing demand for regional service,\" Dinneen said. \"We are filling a niche.\"  abha.bhattarai@washpost.com",

        "content": " After years of rumors, Amazon.com might finally be getting into the smartphone business. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Seattle e-commerce giant will release a smartphone in the second half of the year, citing people briefed on the company's plans. Those people said Amazon plans to announce the phone by the end of June and begin shipping units by the end of September. A smartphone would be the latest hardware addition for Amazon, which already competes against Apple and Samsung in the tablet space with its Kindle Fire. Its newly announced Kindle Fire TV is an Internet video-streaming set-top box that is going up against the likes of Apple TV, Roku and Google Chromecast. If Amazon follows its tablet and e-reader pricing model, consumers can expect a mid-priced smartphone. The Journal said Amazon has been demonstrating versions of the phone to developers in recent weeks. The phone reportedly features a screen capable of displaying 3-D images without special glasses. Amazon didn't immediately return a call or e-mail for comment. Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post. U.S. stocks slid in a volatile session Friday, with the Nasdaq closing below the 4000 mark for the first time since early February. For the week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.6 percent and the Nasdaq lost 3.1 percent, the biggest weekly decline for both indexes since June 2012. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.47 points or 0.9 percent, to end at 16,026.75. The S&P lost 17.39 points or 0.9 percent, to finish at 1815.69. The Nasdaq composite dropped 54.38 points or 1.3 percent, to close at 3999.73. JPMorgan Chase shares fell 3.7 percent to close at $55.30. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P after the bank reported a far weaker-than-expected quarterly profit as revenue from securities trading fell. The Nasdaq biotech index fell 2.8 percent after rising as much as 1 percent earlier. The Global X social media index, which includes Facebook and LinkedIn , slid 2.3 percent. Facebook shares fell 1.1 percent to $58.53. LinkedIn shares lost 2.5 percent to end at $165.78. In contrast to the day's sharp downturn, shares of Wells Fargo rose 0.8 percent to $48.08 after the biggest U.S. mortgage lender reported a 14 percent increase in first-quarter net profit. Shares of Herbalife sold off late in the day after the Financial Times reported that the Justice Department and the FBI had launched a probe into the company. The stock tumbled 14 percent to close at $51.48. Herbalife denied the report. l Passengers sailing from the Port of Baltimore on the Grandeur of the Seas have been sickened on two consecutive trips, federal health officials said. The most recent outbreak occurred on the Royal Caribbean International vessel, which left Baltimore last Saturday for a seven-day cruise to the Bahamas, Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its Web site that about 100 passengers and crew members fell ill with vomiting and diarrhea. Martinez said a norovirus was believed to be the cause. More than 100 passengers and crew members got sick on the Grandeur's previous cruise from Baltimore from March 28 to April 5, the CDC said, blaming norovirus. l Southwest Airlines said one of the pilots of a plane that landed at the wrong Missouri airport in January has retired and the other has returned to duty. While confirming that the captain of the flight was back at work and the first officer had elected to retire, spokeswoman Brandy King declined to say which pilot was in control when the flight landed. l Exxon Mobil's CEO received compensation worth $28.1 million last year, a 3 percent increase over the previous year, according to an Associated Press analysis of a company regulatory filing. Most of Rex W. Tillerson's compensation was in the form of stock awards, which the oil company valued at $21.3 million when they were granted. His overall compensation for 2013 was up from $27.2 million in 2012, the AP had calculated. l The producer price index, which measures price changes before they reach the consumer, rose 0.5 percent in March, the Labor Department said. Overall inflation remains relatively tame. Producer prices increased 1.4 percent during the past 12 months. Excluding the volatile categories of food, energy, and retailer and wholesaler profit margins, core prices ticked up 0.3 percent. l Consumer confidence rose this month to the highest level since July, boosted by further improvement in the labor market that will provide some traction for the economy after a weather-related slowdown early this year.

        "content": " Here are five ideas that can have an impact on how we live, work and play. Digital mesh. Right now we think of Uber as a car service, but that could change. Amazon was once an online bookstore and Google only a search engine. Uber executives appear on their way to expanding the service into a digital mesh, a logistical network that helps city dwellers get what they want where they want it. On Monday word arrived of UberRush, a bike courier system in New York. \"UberRush is like when Amazon first revealed it was no longer *just* a bookstore. Now comes a steady march toward global domination,\" Box chief executive Aaron Levie tweeted Monday night. We've heard talk of this before. Kevin Roose of New York Magazine has written that Uber could be more valuable than Facebook. Uber investor Shervin Pishevar once described the potential this way: \"Uber is creating a digital mesh -- a power grid which goes within the metropolitan areas. After you have that power grid running, in everyone's pockets, there's lots of possibility of what you could build like a platform. Uber is incorporated in the empire-building phase.\" So could Uber's disruption of the taxi industry be just the beginning? A cynic would say every company talks big when an IPO may be on the horizon. Having a great story and interesting plans helps build interest from investors, who love to buy into growth companies. UberRush is the first significant step toward seeing if Uber can build out a digital mesh to help provides instant gratification of whatever city residents want. Master data, or your company won't last. Via the Next Web: Data is a guaranteed disruptor. Amazon used data to disrupt retail. Netflix used it to overhaul video rentals; Spotify and Pandora transformed radio. From retail to lending, other industries are undergoing similar evolutions. Users have spoken. They like personalization, and that boils down to data. The more that companies can refine their use of data, the more they stand to gain. Using drones to make art. Via the Verge: KATSU apparently began work on the drones with the intention of programming them to write graffiti. In the end, it seems that their results became too imperfect: The force of their twirling propellers would whip the paint around, and the force of the paint would cause the drone to wobble as it attempted to stabilize itself. Humans replacing robots on an assembly line. Here's an interesting approach from Toyota. Via Bloomberg: Humans are taking the place of machines in plants across Japan so workers can develop new skills and figure out ways to improve production lines and the car-building process. Mitsuru Kawai credits manual labor for helping workers at Honsha improve production of axle beams and cut the costs of making chassis parts. Closing apps doesn't make your iPhone battery last longer. Via Scotty Loveless: You are actually making your battery life worse if you do this on a regular basis. By closing the app, you take the app out of the phone's RAM. While you think this may be what you want to do, it's not. When you open that same app again the next time you need it, your device has to load it back into memory all over again. All of that loading and unloading puts more stress on your device than just leaving it alone. Plus, iOS closes apps automatically as it needs more memory, so you're doing something your device is already doing for you.",

        "name": "Amazon Fire TV falls behind the competition ",
        "content": " Amazon's promise with its new set-top box, the Fire TV, is that it will make watching video from a variety of online sources easier. When it introduced the product earlier this week, Amazon made it clear in the presentation that it understands the frustrations and problems that consumers face when trying to choose a video to watch on their televisions. But, with Fire TV, Amazon still hasn't quite managed to solve those problems. One of Amazon's biggest boasts about Fire TV is that it allows people to use their voices to search through content. You can search for a movie, genre or actor by hitting a microphone button on the Fire TV's remote and holding it down as you speak. The voice recognition isn't perfect, but it works as well or better than Apple's Siri or the voice-control capabilities on Microsoft's Xbox One -- about 12 of 15 queries offered up the right answer in one round of searching. But voice search doesn't work in third-party apps such as YouTube or Netflix. That's not Amazon's fault, it's worth knowing before you imagine that Fire TV will eliminate the need to use the remote to hunt-and-peck your way through finding your favorite program. Another drawback: The search feature doesn't dig deeply into the offerings outside Amazon's own catalog. So even if something is free to watch on Netflix, it probably won't show up as such in a Fire TV search. Instead, you'd be directed to buy the title on Amazon or become an Amazon Prime member for $99 a year. Amazon touted its open ecosystem heavily in its presentation, but it's still difficult for users to take advantage of all those apps if they don't show up prominently in search. Like other Amazon hardware, the Fire TV is best used for consuming content in Amazon's own ecosystem, rather than outside of it. Amazon also has some work to do to build out its video catalog. These efforts take time and energy, of course, but Amazon's rookie status is clear when compared to others already in this space, such as Apple or market-leading set-top box firm Roku. Notable gaps, such as HBO Go, will fill in over time, but consumers may want to wait to see how the partnerships play out before spending the $99 on the Fire TV. Finally, gaming was described as a \"bonus\" feature for the Fire TV, signaling that Amazon isn't looking to take on Microsoft's Xbox One or Sony's PlayStation 4 any time soon. So, while the gaming features on the Fire TV are a nice distinguishing factor for the box, so far they can't compete with true, dedicated consoles. Amazon's most impressive game so far is \"Sev Zero,\" a fun, engaging title made by the firm's in-house Amazon Game Studio. It's well-designed for a tweener market of gamers who are ready to graduate from the smartphone but aren't quite ready for a full console. But while the games on the Fire TV are solid, including some big titles, such as Mojang's Minecraft: Pocket Edition, they aren't a selling point on their own quite yet. What Amazon has in the Fire TV is a lot of potential. The intuitive search tool may eventually be a killer feature. The games could become a real draw over time, especially as Amazon Game Studios continues to evolve. And Amazon says it's planning to invest more heavily in content partnerships to expand its offerings. But if you want a solution that comes out of the box, today, to solve all your set-top box problems, the Fire TV falls short.",

        "content": " Amazon added another string or two to its bow this week, announcing not only that it's releasing a streaming video set-top box, but also using that device to take a major step into the wider world of video games. The tech titan has dabbled in gaming in the past, thanks to its tablet business. The Amazon Kindle Fire, simply by virtue of being one of the most popular Android tablets on the market, has obviously picked up some users who play mobile games. Building on that audience, Amazon is using the Fire TV to address a gap in the gaming market -- the space between the phone or tablet and the full-fledged console. Plenty of people play games nowadays, but don't necessarily consider themselves \"gamers,\" said Forrest analyst James McQuivey. Who are those people? Probably you or someone you know, he said. These are the people who \"say they're not gamers, but they just play some Candy Crush,\" he explained. It's actually a pretty sweet spot in the gaming space right now, since more people than ever are playing games on a regular basis but don't quite play enough to spend their cash on Sony's PlayStation 4, Microsoft's Xbox One or Nintendo 's Wii U. So while Amazon's a little late to the party when it comes to video games, it's coming at just the right time for this audience. The introduction also puts Amazon at the leading edge of a major trend in the future of gaming: streaming games. Just a few years ago, playing games processed completely in the cloud meant dealing with frustrating, often unworkable delays for players -- even a few milliseconds make a huge different in some games. Even streaming the lighter games Amazon has packed into its 4.5 inch by 4.5 inch box would have been very difficult to for any console maker. But with technology advances and the fact that the games on Amazon's device aren't the graphics-intensive power hogs that tax dedicated consoles, the Fire TV seems more than able of handling that load. Not that it's all super-casual stuff. \"Sev Zero,\" a launch title from Amazon's own in-house game studio looks and feels like a game that you could have seen in the early days of the Xbox 360, with a control scheme that all-but requires the company's dedicated, more traditional looking $40 controller: And connectivity is a key part of the new slate of Amazon games. Sev Zero's tower defense/third-person shooter mechanics are fun, but the game also has a unique approach to cooperative play. Players can control different aspects of the game using a Kindle Fire HDX tablet -- similar to the asymmetrical play we've seen on the Wii U. And the Fire TV version of Minecraft, which is just the game's mobile \"pocket edition,\" also has a cool co-op feature that lets players on the same WiFi network collaborate in-game from any device that also has the mobile Minecraft app. Finally, Amazon's also being smart about pricing. Executives said that the average price of a game will be just $1.85 (though many of the title shown today are $6.99). They know that the games they're putting on Fire TV aren't the same as the big-budget titles that dominate the hardcore gaming space, so they're not even flirting with the $60 or $70 price tag of most new console titles. But they also know that some of the Fire TV's target audience is willing to put a little more cash to get a really good game -- just a tad more than the 99 cents or (maybe $2) people are willing to pay for a mobile game. It's just the right price for their target audience: those who may crave more than what they get from free games, but not too much more.",

        "name": "For Amazon, the future of television could be e-commerce in your living room ",
        "content": " For many of the top companies in the tech sector, TV is one of the hottest areas of innovation right now. Almost every month seems to bring news of how some tech heavyweight -- like Google or Apple or Yahoo -- promises to introduce a new way to watch TV, a new way to connect the Internet to your TV or a new way to stream TV content to your mobile device. The latest example of innovation, course, is the new Amazon video streaming set-top box, Fire TV. On the surface, of course, the $99 Amazon Fire TV may seem like, at most, an incremental improvement on what exists already (e.g. the $99 Apple TV). Sure, there's great content from entertainment partners, voice search and the ability to play video games, but nothing obvious that would suggest that Fire TV is somehow the future of TV. It even looks a lot like the Apple TV. For now, the launch of Fire TV is more of a way to poach consumers away from companies such as Apple and give non-Amazon consumers one more reason to explore the entertainment options of Amazon's ecosystem. Every dollar you might have spent with Apple you'd now be spending with Amazon. But let's think about the next iteration of Fire TV. By then, Amazon will have most likely figured out ways to embed e-commerce options into Fire TV. That would be big it would mean that consumers would most likely be able to purchase products directly from their TV. Imagine watching the latest streaming content from Netflix or Showtime (two of the launch partners announced for Fire TV), and simultaneously being able to purchase clothing worn by one of the characters in a hit TV show, all without leaving your seat on the couch. Even better for Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, imagine watching original studio content produced by Amazon (e.g. \"Alpha House\") and then purchasing items featured in those shows easily and conveniently from Amazon partners. Unlike all the other tech companies out there trying to reinvent TV, Amazon is also the world's largest e-commerce company that also happens to have an awful lot of data already about you. Fire TV arrives pre-registered to your Amazon account, and that means, at some point in the future, Amazon could make it a seamless process to go from watching entertainment content to buying things online. Amazon already knows what types of books you like, what types of films you prefer to watch and when you like to watch them. There's early buzz about the Amazon \"ASAP\" feature that enables Amazon to deliver video content to you even before you've ordered it, based only on its knowledge of your viewing habits. ASAP predicts what movies and TV episodes you'll want to watch and buffers them for playback before you hit play. Imagine what happens when Amazon adds an ASAP feature for other products, as well. That means that ad-supported model or subscription-based model for TV could one day become an e-commerce supported model. By launching Fire TV, Amazon has pieced together the next element of its entertainment ecosystem that makes possible a combination of all three business models. For Kindle Fire users, Amazon already has a subscription-based option for viewing video entertainment as well as an a la carte option. With Fire TV, it now has the makings of an ad-supported and e-commerce supported model. It will be interesting to see the answering moves from the likes of Apple and Roku, both of which have popular streaming set-top boxes. It's almost a no-brainer that Apple will introduce a voice search option in an upcoming version of Apple TV, and may attempt to replicate the Amazon ASAP buffering feature with some kind of \"genius\" option. Who knows? Maybe Apple will decide to launch endless patent wars against Amazon and Fire TV, the same way it has launched patent wars to stifle competition from Samsung in the smartphone market. For all the talk of Internet TV going mainstream and all the stories about consumers watching TV on their mobile devices, it's clear that the TV in the living room still has an important role to play in determining the competitive mix of the tech industry. You can't argue with the numbers, which suggest that Americans still consume the overwhelming majority of their video content on their TV. Yet, there's enough fragmentation in the way people watch TV that the Amazon set-top box may simplify the decision-making process for consumers willing to commit to a specific content ecosystem. With the launch of Fire TV, it's clear that Amazon has figured out the new logic of the tech industry: the company that controls your TV wins.",

        "content": " NEW YORK \u2014 Amazon.com stepped into the fight to control America's televisions Wednesday, unveiling a $99 set-top box known as Fire TV. The small black device will allow viewers to watch movies and other video content on their televisions, bridging a gap between shopping and entertainment that the firm has long strived to address. It puts Amazon at the center of a growing battle among tech giants to reinvent TV watching. Televisions have become thinner and larger in the past decade, but the industry has struggled to make them any smarter. Amazon said its device would make it easier for consumers to find the content they want and address the poor video streaming quality that keeps some from watching shows online. The device also comes with components normally found in top-level smartphones, including advanced WiFi antennas to keep customers from that frustrating buffering experience. Fire TV includes voice search \u2014 something that industry observers have long expected Apple to do with its Siri technology \u2014 allowing users to speak into the remote to find a genre, actor or title. \"This is voice search that actually works,\" said Kindle Vice President Peter Larsen, perhaps taking a dig at Apple's Siri or the voice-control capabilities in Microsoft's Xbox One. Amazon also threw in an curveball. Fire TV will also work as a stripped-down game console, launching with such titles as Minecraft and Asphalt 8. But Amazon faces stiff competition, and others have tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to gain a foothold in America's living rooms. According to data from Nielsen published in February, Americans spend an average of 185 hours per month with their televisions, as opposed to 34 hours and 21 minutes with their smartphones. And although mobile use is on a steady rise \u2014 up an average of six hours from the same time last year \u2014 much of that time is spent accessing entertainment content. To compete, Amazon must take on Roku, the market leader in the set-top box space. It will also go against Apple's \"hobby\" product, the Apple TV, which has never taken off outside of the firm's most devoted fans. Google, which tried and largely failed to get a foothold in the smart television space a couple of years ago, finally hit on a solution last year with the $35 Chromecast, but it still does not have the content breadth to compete widely. Most of Roku's devices are cheaper and give consumers access to more video content. But \"Roku has to be nervous,\" said Forrester Research analyst James L. McQuivey. Amazon will take awhile to catch up, particularly overseas, where Roku and Apple see stronger sales, but U.S. customers are looking for an easy way to get streaming content on the television, he said. The media landscape has become fractured with viewers choosing between content from several streaming sites, cable providers, broadcast channels, video-on-demand services and more. Sifting through multiple services' catalogues is a frustrating experience when all you want to do is satisfy a movie craving. \"It's gotten worse,\" said Dan Rayburn, principal analyst at Frost & Sullivan and executive vice president of StreamingMedia.com. \"There are more guys with more devices. As more services come out, and they're not all through one portal, you have to go directly to all of these things. That's part of the problem with fragmentation as more of these devices come to the market.\" The launch marks Amazon's most aggressive push into the hardware business since the Kindle Fire. \"They have the marketing power and ability to push it hard,\" Rayburn said, adding that Amazon is no stranger to pushing cheap hardware to sell more content. That was the firm's strategy with its Kindle line of e-readers and tablets for years. And there is a lot of potential upside for Amazon. Those who own the Amazon Kindle, for example, spend $400 more at Amazon than those who don't, according to a study from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. The same firm has also estimated that Prime members spend twice as much as non-Prime members. A streaming video gadget could provide the same kind of boost for Amazon, analysts say. Amazon could have gone further, however, by leveraging its retail expertise and letting consumers use the device's voice-control capabilities for purchases, as well, McQuivey said. \"What we eventually want is television commerce, to be able to buy things from your TV,\" he said. It's a space, he said, that Amazon should \"carve out specifically for itself.\" (Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)  hayley.tsukayama@washpost.com",

        "content": " NEW YORK \u2014 Amazon.com unveiled Amazon Fire TV on Wednesday, saying it wants to take the pain out of the digital video-watching process. Navigating through the current digital video ecosystem can be a slow, complicated process, the company said, and it's hoping that Fire TV will provide consumers who are watching video from a wide variety of sources with an easy way to watch exactly what they want. \"How do we make the complexity disappear?\" said Peter Larsen, vice president of the company's Kindle division. Larsen outlined three major problems that consumers face: difficulty finding what you're looking for, poor video streaming quality and limited, fragmented libraries of content. To solve the first problem, Amazon has built voice search into the box \u2014 something that industry observers have long expected Apple to do with its Siri technology \u2014 letting users speak into the remote to find the genre, actor or title that they're looking for. Addressing the problem of lagging video streaming, the firm has built the device with components normally found in top-level smartphones as well as advanced WiFi antennas to keep customers from that frustrating buffering experience. On the third point, while the firm has been building its own library of media content during the past couple of years, it is also clear that it would need help to have a competitive streaming device. Other launch partners include Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube and sports channels such as MLB.TV. Still, Amazon was careful to highlight its own original content such as the Washington-centric comedy \"Alpha House,\" which is coming back for a second season. The firm also threw in a small curveball, announcing that the Fire TV will also work as a stripped-down game console, launching with titles such as \"Minecraft\" and \"Asphalt 8\" already in its content catalog. The company also showed off titles of its own design \u2014 made through Amazon Game Studios \u2014 such as \"Sev Zero,\" a combination tower-defense and first-person shooter game. Gamers can use the included remote to play games, though the company is also releasing its own, dedicated game controller for $39.99. The device will cost $99, which is on par with Apple's Apple TV and Roku's top-of-the-line set-top box, although significantly more expensive than Google's $35 Chromecast streaming stick and a similar device recently released by Roku.

        "content": " Where's the next major battleground for technology companies? For all the talk of drones, wearables, homes of the future and flying Internet networks, the truth is that tech companies are still keenly interested in the consumer electronics device that's been a fixture in the American living room for decades: the television. Amazon.com is holding a major media event Wednesday to talk about the future of their video business, which is widely expected to be the moment where it becomes one of an increasingly crowded group of firms who want to control your time on the couch. Speculation has been flying for years that Amazon will release a streaming video device -- similar to Apple's Apple TV or Google's Chromecast -- that brings online video content, and potentially Android-based games, to the largest screen in your house. Why? Despite what you may think, the TV is still where people turn for the bulk of their screen time, and Amazon wants to be a main portal for all of your entertainment. (Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) According to the data from the Nielsen published in February, Americans still spend an average of 185 hours per month with their televisions, as opposed to 34 hours and 21 minutes with their smartphones. And while mobile use is on a steady rise -- up an average of six hours from the same time last year -- much of that time is spent accessing entertainment, with Americans reporting 15 percent of all their mobile time is devoted to that exact purpose. And as the media landscape becomes more fractured thanks to viewers picking up content on streaming sites, cable, broadcast channels, video-on-demand services and more, offering something that make it easy and comfortable to watch all that video via one service is more appealing than ever, analysts say. Right now, consumers are constantly sifting through multiple services' catalogs -- a frustrating experience when all you want to do is satisfy a movie craving. \"It's gotten worse,\" said Dan Rayburn, principal analyst at Frost & Sullivan and executive vice president of StreamingMedia.com. \"There are more guys with more devices. As more services come out, and they're not all through one portal, you have to go directly to all of these things. That's part of the problem with fragmentation as more of these devices come to the market.\" For Amazon, which has already been pushing its video service and original studio content such as \"Alpha House\" to mobile and online viewers, it's almost a no-brainer to try and grab a piece of that larger pie. It's an easy prospect for them, Rayburn said. \"They have the marketing power and ability to push it hard,\" he said, adding that Amazon is also no stranger to pushing cheap hardware in order to sell more content -- that's been the firm's successful strategy with its Kindle line of e-readers and tablets for years. Other firms such as Roku, Rayburn noted, are already able to sell their streaming video devices for $50 or less. For Amazon, which could work at a much larger scale, the costs would be nearly negligible. \"What is the cost to Amazon for a box like that?\" Rayburn said. \"They could afford to eat $20 bucks [per device] to get more Prime members.\" And the potential for upside could be enormous. Those who own the Amazon Kindle, for example, spend over $400 more at Amazon than those who don't, according to a study from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. The same firm has also estimated that Prime members spend twice as much as non-Prime members. A streaming video gadget could produce the same kind of boost for Amazon, particularly if the firm offers a deal for Prime membership with purchase, as it has for the Kindle Fire. And while the space is crowded, Amazon doesn't face particularly stiff competition in this space right now, Rayburn said. Roku is the market leader in the set-top box space, but may have trouble competing with Amazon's sheer scale, he said. It's followed by Apple's \"hobby\" product, the Apple TV, which has never taken off outside of the firm's most devoted fans. Google, which tried and largely failed to get a foothold in the smart television space  a couple of years ago, finally hit on a solution last year with the $35 Chromecast, but still doesn't have the content breadth to compete with either. To see early success, Rayburn said, Amazon must beat Apple on price and chip away at Roku's market share -- something it certainly has shown in the past it has the patience to do.",

        "name": "Why Amazon is really launching a free streaming video service [Updated] ",
        "content": " When we talk about the future of television, much of the conversation tends to concentrate around subscriptions as an old solution to a new problem. When network television ratings are diving, guaranteed revenue from users seems like a surer bet than ad sales, especially if advertisers begin to worry that their dollars are buying them fewer eyeballs per show. Upstarts like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and even PlayStation have tried to emulate premium cable, collecting regular fees from a stable subscriber pool, rather than their network counterparts, which rely heavily on ad sales. Until now. Amazon is expected to announce that the company will launch a free streaming service supported by ads, making it a lot more like Hulu or networks like NBC than like Netflix. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Amazon now bundles two separate businesses together. Through a subscription to its Prime service, customers get free two-day shipping on many of the items Amazon offers for sale and access to a large library of streaming video content, including shows and movies Amazon licensed, and the original shows it has in production. When the new service launches, Prime will still exist for those of us who are heavy Amazon purchasers. And while it is not yet clear which streaming content will continue to live behind a paywall and which will be part of the new free service, early reports suggest that Amazon original shows, like tech comedy \"Betas,\" Garry Trudeau's \"Alpha House\" and Jill Soloway's new family dramedy \"Transparent,\" as well as some licensed shows and movies, will be available without a subscription. The move is a nod to the power of the traditional television business model. And that model makes even more sense for Amazon, which has a number of advantages that broadcast television networks and its streaming competitors do not share. Amazon's television network is housed in a giant retailer that sells all sorts of products and collects enormous amounts of data about customers. Last week, my colleague Catherine Rampell suggested that the National Security Agency and Facebook should just team up already to give her relevant advertising that does not make her feel horrible about herself. Amazon can serve those personalized ads in a way that broadcast networks cannot and that Hulu is trying to do with much more limited customer data. And it serves them to consumers who are already watching content in the very same browser window they can use to purchase the products on offer. That may mean that Amazon has to solicit many more ads to cover its huge inventory or that it will have to develop an in-house template for cheap ads to cover products Amazon knows could pop through targeted ads, even if the companies selling them do not have huge promotional budgets. But the experiment seems worth the hassle. One of the truisms of the Internet age has been that while we may not pay for content for dollars, we pay for it in data. Amazon seems like it may have found a way to get us to pay in data, and then turn that data around on us to get us to spend real money, too. Update (8:23 p.m.): Amazon spokeswoman Sally Fouts wrote to me Thursday evening to deny reports in the Wall Street Journal and elsewhere that the company is planning a free streaming service. \"We have a video advertising business that currently offers programs like First Episode Free and ads associated with movie and game trailers, and we're often experimenting with new things, but we have no plans to offer a free streaming media service,\" she wrote in an e-mail. Oh, well. It would have been an interesting experiment, especially if Amazon served up something more interesting than those incredibly irritating ads for Cricket Wireless, currently in heavy rotation on Hulu.",

Amazon sent out a string of e-mails to qualifying customers Tuesday letting them know that their e-book accounts are getting a little fatter now, part of the spoils from the DOJ's e-book price-fixing case against Apple and five major book publishers. (Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Apple is still fighting the case, in which it's accused of working with the publishers to raise prices for e-books. But all of the publishers settled out of court -- while denying wrongdoing -- which is why readers are starting to see some money now. To be eligible for a credit, you must have bought a book published by Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster, Penguin or Macmillan between April 1, 2010 and May 21, 2012. You will not get a credit if you returned the book, Amazon notes in its FAQ on the credits. Other e-book sellers, such as Barnes & Noble, Kobo, Google and Sony, are also set to return money, but Amazon is moving first. Chances are you won't be getting too much back -- the rate is $3.17 per any title that made it onto the New York Times bestsellers list, and 73 cents for other titles from the five publishers in question. It's hard to say how many e-book customers will receive a payment, since those eligible may have bought books from multiple places. The settlement applies to residents of 32 states. The total payout is expected to be $166 million.",

        "content": " Amazon announced Thursday that it was raising the price of its Prime membership service by $20, to $99 a year, the first hike since the program was launched in 2005. Prime members \u2014 among the company's most loyal customers \u2014 receive free two-day shipping on select items and access to a library of instant, streaming video as well as books. The reaction to Amazon's decision is something of an experiment that the retail industry will watch closely. Will the e-commerce giant convince existing Prime customers \u2014 some of whom have a caffeine-like addiction to the service \u2014 that it's worth the higher price tag? Will it modify its services to offer shoppers more bang for their buck? Or will it alienate them as it turns its focus toward profitability? Its success or failure could prove a model to other retailers offering subscription services. On Amazon's discussion board, customer angst was quickly apparent. \"I'll not be renewing my Prime. Not worth $99 a year for me. It's been fun, but fun and necessary are 2 different things,\" wrote one commenter named Tickled Dog. \"It is something I'm going to have to think hard about before I let it renew again,\" wrote another named Sorwen. It's rare for Amazon, which was founded by Washington Post owner Jeffrey P. Bezos and has been content to be a loss leader, to raise the cost of a product. But the company's shipping expenses have long eaten into its bottom line, analysts say. In fact, even increasing Prime's membership fees may not be enough to boost its profits. \"While raising Prime pricing and pitching 'drone delivery' solutions make good headlines, shipping losses remain a burden on profits,\" Colin Gillis, a technology analyst at BGC Partners, wrote in a research note Thursday. (Amazon said last year that it was developing drones to deliver packages in as little as 30 minutes.) In its fourth-quarter earnings report, Amazon posted a profit of $239 million, after two successive quarters of losses. The retailer said Prime has at least 20 million members, so a $20 price increase gives it about $400 million more to put toward infrastructure and content costs. Members make up about 45 percent of all Amazon customers and spend about twice as much, according to a report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a research firm. The price hike is likely to make Prime customers spend even more to get their money's worth, said Josh Lowitz, the research firm's partner and co-founder. \"This may dissuade some lower-value casual shoppers, but those who stay with it will have a subtle encouragement to spend more,\" he said. Amazon hinted at a possible price increase in January, and on Thursday it reaffirmed that the logistical costs of Prime had forced its hand. \"Even as fuel and transportation costs have increased, the price of Prime has remained the same. If you consider things like inflation and fuel costs, a Prime membership valued at $79 in 2005 would be worth more than $100 today,\" Amazon spokeswoman Julie Law said in an e-mail. The extra revenue is also critical as the company builds out its range of in-house products, such as the Kindle line of e-readers and tablets, and ramps up its investment in original content to compete with streaming services such as Netflix. Speaking of Netflix, Amazon is not the first major retailer to raise prices on a popular service. When Netflix suddenly raised the cost of its video streaming service by about 60 percent in 2011, the company faced an instant backlash. More than 800,000 subscribers abandoned the site in a single quarter, forcing the company to restore its original fee. Wholesale giant Costco had a better result after it raised its membership fee by 10 percent in 2012, its first increase since 2007. Customers continued to shop there, and the company posted a profit the next year. Amazon's U.S. price hike follows a similar move in Europe this year, when the company increased membership costs by more than 60 percent for British and German customers, expanding its video offerings in the process. The retailer's stock price was flat Thursday at $371.51.  amrita.jayakumar@washpost.com  hayley.tsukayama@washpost.com",

        "content": " A little bad news for frequent Amazon shoppers: the mega e-retailer has raised the price of its Prime membership by $20, to $99 a year. The company had hinted last year that shipping costs would force it to raise the annual price of its premium membership, which offers to waive the fees for two-day shipping on select items and grants users access to a library of instant, streaming video. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Prime customers got word of the price increase in an e-mail Thursday, explaining that the program has grown rapidly since it was introduced in 2005, and simply could not operate with a membership fee of $79 a year. The higher fee will be charged when users renew their memberships. New customers who sign up in the next seven days can lock in the annual $79 rate. Comparing Prime directly to other streaming video services, the price increase would make Prime more expensive than similar streaming products, such as Netflix and Hulu, which cost about $96 a year. But it's not quite an apples-to-apple comparison, given the shipping discounts. It's rare for Amazon, which has been content to be a loss-leader, to raise the cost of a product. But the firm said that the logistical costs of Prime have forced its hand. \"Even as fuel and transportation costs have increased, the price of Prime has remained the same for nine years,\" the e-mail message from the Prime team said. \"Since 2005, the number of items eligible for unlimited free Two-Day Shipping has grown from one million to over 20 million. We also added unlimited access to over 40,000 movies and TV episodes with Prime Instant Video and a selection of over 500,000 books to borrow from the Kindle Owners' Lending Library.\" Amazon confirmed last year that Prime has at least 20 million members, so a $20 price increase gives the company about $400 million more to put toward infrastructure and content costs. Both are critical as the company continues to build out its range of in-house products, such as the Kindle line of e-readers and tablets, and ramps up its investment in original content to compete with streaming services such as Netflix.

        "name": "How 3D printing could transform Amazon and online shopping ",
        "content": " Amazon's recent decision to create an e-commerce storefront for 3D-printed products could finally bring 3D printing to the mainstream, but not in the way you might think. If you take a quick look at some of the nylon plastic products on offer via Amazon's partner, 3DLT, it's easy to come to the conclusion that the new pilot program is really just about an incremental e-commerce push at Amazon. In other words, Jeff Bezos now allows you to buy groovy new jewelry designs and quirky plastic toys made by 3D printers on Amazon.com rather than on a third-party site from Shapeways, Cubify or MakerBot. You'll now be able to pick up a designer $18.86 plastic belt buckle and $28.26 designer iPhone 5 case at Amazon.com along with your books and lawn products and fashion items and have it all delivered via Amazon Prime. But is that all there is to it? Amazon, which opened a 3D Printer Store on its site to much acclaim in 2013, could be experimenting with a bigger concept: 3D printing is about changing the supply side of the retail business model as much as the demand side. In other words, 3D printing is not just about offering more and more consumer goods in more and more categories so that Amazon can make more and more money (although that is surely part of it). It could be that it's about transforming the online retail model based on our changing notions of scarcity -- scarcity of product as well as scarcity of shelf space in the digital world. In the current retail model, Internet retailers such as Amazon stockpile products, store them in a warehouse, and then deliver them once a customer orders them as quickly and cheaply as possible. Amazon has an edge over traditional retailers (i.e. mom-and-pop book stores) because it can offer more products with nearly unlimited shelf space, thereby driving down the price of its products for consumers. Instead of spending money on costly brick-and-mortar locations, Amazon can focus on increasing the efficiency of its warehouse operations in order to increase its margins on the sales of physical products. In the new model, though, 3D printing could be used to deliver a just-in-time retail experience, in which Amazon wouldn't need to maintain a network of warehouses around the country filled with products, and wouldn't need to invest in drones to deliver those products. Theoretically, one day Amazon might just sell the design file for a product, and the consumer would print the design file at home with a 3D printer in the comfort of his or her living room. Presumably, these consumers would also be purchasing their 3D printers and 3D printer filament from Amazon's 3D Printer Store. Which is why Amazon's new 3D printing pilot is so interesting. 3DLT, one of the five partners that Amazon has selected for the program, has hinted that the future is one in which users simply upload or download 3D design files and print them out with 3D printers. Everyday consumer products, in short, will eventually follow in the wake of plastic toys and plastic jewelry. In this radically new business model, Amazon would be selling the 3D design files and the 3D printers and the 3D printer filament, but wouldn't be selling actual \"products\" as we currently think about them. The consumers would print the products, not buy the products. That's a big idea. We're still far away from that future in which products are sold as digital design files, of course. Today's reality is that you buy a $1,000 3D printer expecting to print light bulbs and tires, and end up printing goo. It still takes exceptional expertise to create 3D design files, and even a fair amount of patience and skill to learn how to use 3D printers. Moreover, until there is a wider variety of materials for 3D printers at a reasonable price point, it's going to be a nylon plastic future for consumers for some time. And that's going to lead to new concerns that the future of 3D printing is just about printing lots and lots of plastic toys. That being said, we're already starting to see increasingly creative and innovative ways that 3D printing is being used these days. We are 3D printing parts for airplanes and cars. We are 3D printing houses. We are 3D printing human body replacement parts. From that perspective, it's easy to see Amazon selling the design files for just about anything -- both organic and inorganic -- from an online storefront in the future. Just as Amazon transformed the retail shopping experience using the economies of scale made possible by the Internet, it may be able to use 3D printing to transform the retail shopping experience yet again.",

        "name": "Why Amazon's 'Transparent' could prove to be a milestone ; One show could cause waves. ",
        "content": " As Amazon has moved into the original television business, the online retailer has made a great deal of the fact that, unlike its network competitors, it's showing audiences the pilots of the shows it's considering picking up and considering audiences' reviews as part of its decision-making process. But when the company announced which of its second round of pilots would be moving forward to full series, it made one decision that seemed more attuned to critical opinion than pure public reaction. Among other shows, Amazon's moving forward with \"Transparent,\" a dark comedy from creator Jill Soloway about a Los Angeles family. And not just any Los Angeles family. Jeffrey Tambor stars in the show as Mort, a transgender woman who's preparing to come out to her family, and who's spending time living in the gender identity she plans to transition to before having surgery to change her body. Transgender characters are exceptionally rare on television, and \"Transparent\" may well be the first American show to tackle this stage of gender transition. The show also breaks with another tradition in American pop culture. Rather than serving up Mort as a deviation from the norm from which the non-trans, heterosexual members of his family can learn and ultimately use as a spur to their growth, everyone in Mort's family is analyzing their own identity. Mort's daughter Sarah (Amy Landecker), who is married to a man, discovers Mort's plans during a tryst with one of her former lovers, a woman. And his younger children, Ali (Gaby Hoffmann, fresh off a revealing stint on Girls) and Josh (Jay Duplass) are struggling to determine who they are professionally and sexually after years of depending on Mort financially. It's no mistake that a family this complex is showing up in a comedy, rather than a drama. Amazon has picked up several hour-long shows, too. But in \"Transparent,\" it's recognizing a growing trend: If you want to tell a serious story about our culture, politics and sexuality, you have to get silly. Seventeen years ago, when \"Oz\" premiered on HBO, it was a drama that provided television audiences with a serious look at the American prison system, with all of its gang dynamics, spiritual crises, fluid sexuality and class difference. Now, that slot's filled by a dramedy -- Netflix's \"Orange is the New Black,\" created by Jenji Kohan and based on Piper Kerman's memoir of the same name. The men of \"Oz\" were sometimes baroquely violent criminals and repulsive people made sympathetic by sensitive writing and carefully-developed relationships. But the women of \"Orange Is The New Black\" are largely non-violent offenders, incarcerated for frauds, drug offenses and crimes of passion. And the show, in between dance-offs and quests for a legendary chicken, raises serious questions about prison health care, support for former inmates as they're released back into the community and the training given to prison staff. \"Orange is the New Black\" is hardly the only comedy or show with humorous elements to steal a march on its dramatic, and supposedly more serious, predecessors. Dramas \"House of Cards\" and \"The Newsroom\" make a virtue of their cynicism, insisting, respectively, that pure ruthlessness and a willingness to stick it to corporate phonies are somehow missing from our political and media environments. If only, both shows insist, politicians and journalists were willing to just behave differently, it would be easier to make significant change. That's a shockingly naive view of Washington and of the media. Two comedies, HBO's \"Veep\" and NBC's \"Parks and Recreation\" paint a much more complex portraits of American politics and the challenges of achieving substantive change through elected office and government bureaucracy. Vice President Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and civil-servant-turned-city-councilwoman Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) are both talented women whose personalities sometimes get the best of them: They can be bossy, self-absorbed and rude to people who disappoint them. But they're also working in environments where their talents aren't always an asset. Selina is a sharp-tongued woman in a job where she's only supposed to speak platitudes, while Leslie is a policy wonk whose proposals often put her out ahead of her Indiana constituency. Both shows suggest that politics' true problems are as silly as often as they are grand. But that doesn't make those problems any less maddening--just more difficult to transcend. That willingness to acknowledge goofiness, confusion and spluttering frustration is also part of the comedies that aren't about policy or process, but simply about the parts of day-to-day life that are intensely political. On FX's sitcom \"Louie,\" Louis C.K. struggles with how to explain racism to his young daughters, while also introducing them to his great aunt Ellen, who uses racist slang. Fox's \"Raising Hope,\" a portrait of a blue-collar family that's wrapping up its fourth and final season this spring, has captured everything from the characters' joy in getting the education they missed out on to the delirium of a sugar rush from a wildly unbalanced diet. \"Looking,\" HBO's sitcom about young gay men in San Francisco, has conjured up a hilarious sketch of white liberal discomfort and guilt in the interracial relationship between Patrick (Jonathan Groff), a young, white, affluent video-game designer, and Richie (Ra l Castillo), his Latino hairstylist boyfriend. Even HBO's much-criticized \"Girls\" has taken a flaying knife to how the money that lets young women float aimlessly in New York gives them an excuse not to develop the social and professional skills that would allow them to become independent. This is not to say that dramas can't thoughtfully explore political issues. The sweeping fantasy \"Game of Thrones\" may be treated like a genre trifle, but it's deeply engaged with what happens to a society that tolerates sexual violence and massive class stratifications. And CBS's \"The Good Wife\" is the first show to consider the challenges of technology policy and law in a sustained and sophisticated way. But many of their hour-long counterparts are so caught up in grisly crimes, troubled middle-aged men and grim portents that they're missing the rest of life. It's in comedies where the laughter keeps us clear-eyed enough to see what's happening around us.",

According to TechCrunch, Facebook is looking to drones to help it fulfill its mission to wire the parts of the world that still aren't connected to the Internet -- the company has declined to comment on rumors or speculation. The unmanned systems in question are made by Titan Aerospace and are meant to fly way up in the atmosphere to provide Internet connections to rural or undeveloped areas. They can carry a payload of up to 25 pounds and can stay in the air for up to five years. By comparison, the \"octocopters\" that Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos has talked about are lighter and smaller and fly much, much lower. As you can probably guess from the name, they have eight rotors. While the Titan Aerospace drones can fly up to 65,000 feet, the delivery bots from the Amazon fleet are meant to zoom closer to a human scale and can go a distance of about 10 miles with a five-pound payload, as The Washington Post reported. Amazon faces regulatory restrictions to fly its UAS's -- because regulators will want to keep track of how all those copters zip over buildings and homes and set safety rules about what those drones can and cannot do. They'll also want to take precautions to make sure the drones aren't flying into things and are insulated against being taken over by hijackers. Those regulatory concerns aren't quite as important to Titan Aerospace because its drones may fly above zones that the FAA regulates -- though launching them may be a more complicated regulatory issue, if done over the United States. Once they're up in the air, however, they could reach places that may not be regulated by the United States, said Cameron Cloar, an aviation litigation attorney at San Francisco's Nixon Peabody. \"These aircraft may present new regulatory issues for the FAA that it's not had to deal with before,\" he said. The FAA estimates that there will be 7,500 in the United States by 2018, but you shouldn't expect to see your pizza delivered by UAS any time soon. Cloar said that commercial use of drones in FAA space is farther down the agency's list of priorities, meaning ideas such as the plan that Amazon has posed or Nokia Here chief Christof Hellmis's dream of using mapping drones won't come to the United States until the government has gathered data from its UAS test site and opened airspace to the public sector for testing. For now, the FAA must approve commercial drone use on a case-by-case basis, as it did for ConocoPhillips last year to allow the firm to conduct research in the Arctic Circle.",

        "name": "The Air Force general who channels a mellow CEO's leadership style ; The general who leads the Air Force Academy shares tactics with Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh. ",
        "content": " We've all worked in companies with ugly cultures. Leaders bark orders and we are expected to blindly obey, even if it's the wrong decision for the consumer or the company. Most obey their marching orders, but some passionate employees propose creative solutions to problems, only to have their ideas ignored. \"Just do the job I hired you to do,\" they say. The frustration builds, stripping employees of their natural creativity. They become exasperated and stop caring. Many would describe this leadership style as militaristic. Conditioning people to be order-taking cogs may have seemed logical in the armed forces, but in today's fast moving, creative economy it hurts innovation and creativity. Perhaps our idea of militarist leadership is due for an update. Brig. Gen. Gregory Lengyel leads the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., and it's apparent he follows a completely different set of rules. He may not be creating the next hot start-up right now, but his creative leadership style fits into the playbook of Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh. Hsieh is well-regarded for his unorthodox leadership that grew Zappos into a heavyweight in online commerce. The Zappos culture is second to none. If you've ever spoken to a Zappos employee, it's evident they work someplace special. Here are five Zappos Core Family Values Hsieh and Lengyel share: Embrace and drive change Can you simply go to your boss with ideas and advice on how to fix problems or challenges in your organization? To many, this is laughable \u2014 companies don't operate this way and certainly not our our armed forces, yet at the U.S. Air Force Academy the newest cadets voice is just as important as the highest ranking officers. Lt. Col. Jay Tewksbury and Army Lt. Col. Rich Ramsey came to Lengyel with fundamental flaws they observed in the organization. They believed officers attitudes were causing an \"us vs. them mentality\" with new cadets, hurting productivity and undermining authority. They believed this resulted in new cadets bonding closely together as a unit against a shared common enemy, the upper class cadets, Lengyel and his staff. Instead of scolding these officers for questioning his leaders, Lengyel embraced their feedback and used it to drive change. Moving forward, instead of bearing down on cadets like prison guards, they trained officers to be mentors, teachers, and encouragers, giving fresh cadets the tools to become better. The division disappeared, and a sense of team was created. Building open and honest relationships with communication \"Because I said so\" leadership may work for a child but it doesn't work with adults. In the Air Force it created frustration and confusion, resulting in more infractions and disdain for leadership. Lengyel's focus on open and honest communication meant his officers carefully explained why they focus on objectives and what they are aiming to accomplish. He combined their new sense of ownership with clear, written expectations so not only the cadets are held responsible, but their leaders. Build a positive team and family spirit Lengyel noticed the number of infractions and behavioral issues at the academy, many of which were alcohol related. One reason was the demand the academy placed on cadets' weekends, limiting social time normally crucial for relationship building. This resulted in cadets drinking a few weekends' worth of beer in one evening, knowing they wouldn't get the chance for another month. Instead of responding with stricter discipline, Lengyel asked his officers if weekend activities could be combined or streamlined, giving his cadets more free time. They were able to do more with less, opening up more free time. Infractions dropping by over 40 percent since the changes, according to Lengyel. By responding with empathy, Lengyel created a family spirit, allowing cadets to feel they were appreciated. Be passionate and determined Cadets come to the Air Force because they are passionate about serving their country. But the culture of compliance tends to suck that passion out of them in an instant. Realizing this strips a cadet of strong intrinsic motivators, Lengyel and his officers take a different approach. After clearly communicating objectives and goals to achieve, Lengyel and his officers take a step back, turning responsibility over to the cadet. Lengyel loosens the screws instead of tightening them and this new freedom effectively utilizes cadets natural passion, inspiring achievement far beyond acts done out of compliance. Be humble \"I'm not -- by far -- the smartest guy on my team\" Lengyel says. \"My team has done a wonderful job, in many cases they come up with better solutions than I would have.\" By listening, empathizing and trusting his team, he has allowed a creative culture to thrive. Lengyel doesn't think his leadership style is all that unique and sees it as common sense. He is quick to cite the leaders that have mentored him. But still, it's not easy. Stepping back to give cadets ownership is a scary thing, especially when so much is on the line. Lengyel and his staff are quick to step in to prevent injury or anything illegal, but that rarely happens. Instead, cadets seem to self-correct. Part of the process is giving space for failure, so it doesn't happen when lives are on the line. Whether you're selling shoes, leading a billion dollar organization, or commanding troops, these five lessons are crucial today. Millennials bring passion and creativity to the workforce, but militaristic leadership isn't the answer, not even for the military itself. \"Many organizations give their staff responsibility, but few give staff the authority,\" Lengyel says. Giving his cadets authority, means they take ownership and with ownership comes commitment. \"I don't want compliance,\" Lengyel said. \"I want commitment.\" Brady is a writer and speaker focused on cultivating creativity.

The State Department offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Guzman's arrest. The same reward is being offered for suspects connected with the U.S.S. Cole bombing, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the highjacking of TWA Flight 847 and several al-Qaeda operatives.

While Comcast the internet provider tries desperately not to be a \"dumb pipe\" by providing all sorts of value-added services, it has no incentive to make streaming of the Olympics available because Comcast the corporation makes more money if you have to buy both internet and cable from them.

        "name": "Is there a place for Amazon in the gaming market?; With the purchase of a prominent game studio, it seems the firm is getting into the console world. But why? ",
        "content": " Amazon has acquired gaming studio Double Helix, resparking rumors that the tech giant is looking to step more fully into the world of video games. Double Helix is best known for producing the Xbox One launch game \"Killer Instinct,\" and is based in Irvine, Calif. Its games are not the sort of mobile games that Amazon already offers for its own tablets. Double Helix makes titles more suited to the computer \u2014 or to the console. Several media reports confirmed the acquisition, which was originally reported by TechCrunch. In a statement on Thursday, Amazon said it \"has acquired Double Helix as part of our ongoing commitment to build innovative games for customers.\" The acquisition comes just a week after gaming Web site VG24/7 reported that Amazon is working on an Android-based console, citing unnamed sources who said the new piece of hardware will retail for less than $300. It's not the first time that Amazon's name has been linked with games. The company already has a development wing called Amazon Game Studios, which currently offers one game: the Android-based \"Air Patriots,\" made for its Kindle line of tablets and other Android devices. With the addition of Double Helix, however, the game effort could take on a whole new spin. There's certainly space in the gaming world for another player \u2014 one who appeals to those between the hard-core gamers on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and the more casual gamers on smartphones and tablets. Others have tried to step into that space, most notably Ouya, a Kickstarter-backed independent console that starts at $99. (Ouya also recently released a new console that comes with double the memory for $129.) One reason why Ouya and others have thus far failed to grab a substantial piece of the market, is that they haven't had broad developer support. It's actually a quandary that a lot of new entrants face in any software market. It's hard to attract developers unless you can prove the customers are there. And it's hard to attract customers if you can't promise them that there will be good software \u2014 in this case, games \u2014 for them to enjoy. But if Amazon's taking the sector seriously, it could get around that problem by simply buying up the credibility it needs. After all, it's something they've tried before, with some pretty good success. The company's work on Amazon Studios \u2014 its original series division \u2014 shows that it's not afraid to throw money at content. On Thursday, Amazon debuted a second wave of original pilots for its Amazon Prime service, which has already launched successful shows including Gary Trudeau's \"Alpha House\" and another original series, \"Betas.\" It's not a perfect parallel, since a developer such as Double Helix would likely want to produce in-house games rather than take submissions from others. But if Amazon shows the same willingness to fully invest in games that it has with its shows, its brand alone could easily attract talent from the gaming world on a higher level. As for the hardware itself, it may not make a whole lot of sense for Amazon to release a dedicated gaming console. But modern consoles aren't just for gaming. They rely on other content, mostly streaming video of the kind Amazon's own Prime Video service provides. Rumors that Amazon's been planning a set-top box stretch back years. If those rumors are true, then it's not crazy to think that such a device would also include access to high-quality, downloadable or streaming games. And if Amazon packaged all that together and priced it more like it has its Kindle line? Well then, Amazon will have ably filled that mid-range hole in the gaming market with a device that could have wide appeal to self-proclaimed gamers of the world \u2014 a demographic that's at a billion and counting.

        "name": "Verizon denies using net neutrality victory to sabotage Netflix, Amazon ",
        "content": " After a federal court said last month that the government couldn't prohibit Internet providers from slowing or blocking Web traffic, at least one ISP is being accused of taking advantage of the ruling. On Wednesday, a Texas man named David Raphael wrote on his blog that Verizon was intentionally throttling Netflix subscribers and other Internet users who rely on Amazon's cloud computing service. Verizon quickly denied the complaint, saying it continues to treat all traffic equally. Raphael, a software engineer for the cloud-based security firm iScan Online, said he was first alerted to the problem on Jan. 26 when the president of his company complained of \"major slowdowns\" while using iScan remotely. After determining that nothing was amiss with iScan's product, Raphael returned home to find that his own connection to Amazon Web Services \u2014 on which iScan runs \u2014 had been degraded. Connections to AWS were limited to 40 kBps, Raphael said \u2014 about 240 times slower than the 75 Mbps fiber optic connection Raphael was paying for. Raphael discovered that even content hosted on AWS by others, including Netflix, was also slower. \"This scenario is impacting different AWS folks,\" he said in an interview. Thinking the error could be part of a wider phenomenon, Raphael said he tried loading the same content as though he were in the office by \"remoting\" in. The office connection was normal, at 5,000 kBps. So the problem appeared limited to Raphael's home and that of iScan's president \u2014 both of which are on Verizon FiOS. When Raphael contacted Verizon about the issue, a customer representative acknowledged that Verizon was \"limiting bandwidth to cloud providers\": It's worth treating the rep's statement with a great deal of skepticism; the chances that this one person is completely aware of everything the company is doing seems pretty remote. Still, this was after the representative asked Raphael to perform various diagnostic tests, including a speed test using Verizon's own software, which showed Raphael's service was otherwise running normally at 75 Mbps. \"We tested some Google downloads and tested downloading SketchUp [a form of 3D design software],\" said Raphael. Everything seemed to perform smoothly; only AWS loaded slowly. An AWS spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment. In a statement to the Washington Post, Verizon said it was investigating the report and that the customer rep was misinformed. \"We treat all traffic equally, and that has not changed,\" the statement read. \"Many factors can affect the speed of a customer's experience for a specific site, including that site's servers, the way the traffic is routed over the Internet and other considerations. We are looking into this specific matter, but the company representative was mistaken. We're going to redouble our representative education efforts on this topic.\" Under the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules, broadband companies were forbidden from slowing down or blocking connections to content. That prohibition was struck by the D.C. Circuit court last month, enabling companies to legally throttle service if they chose. Verizon suggested in oral argument last fall that it was interested in different service models. \"I'm authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements,\" said Verizon's lawyer, Helgi Walker. The FCC has said it intends to seek other ways to help keep the Internet open. Both the report and the denial leave us in a pretty murky situation. Since I'm a FiOS subscriber, you can be sure I'll be testing this myself from home tonight.",

        "name": "Here's why Amazon Prime's price may go up by $20 or more ; Amazon Prime\u2019s pretty lucrative. So why is its price probably going up rather than down? ",
        "content": " During an earnings call Thursday, Amazon said it was looking into bumping up the price of Amazon Prime by 20 or 40 bucks. The Prime service currently charges a flat $79 for a year of all-you-can-ship service on millions of items. But despite staying at the same price point since its launch in 2005, Prime has been pretty lucrative for Amazon -- in fact, some research shows Prime subscribers spend twice as much on the online shopping site as non-Prime shoppers. So why is Amazon considering raising barriers to joining rather than lowering them? Because one of the psychological factors for why Prime customers spend so much is they want to make sure they get their money's worth from the upfront subscription cost. \"Though expensive for the Company in the short-term, it's a significant benefit and more convenient for customers,\" said Amazon CEO (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos in a press release announcing the service. \"With Amazon Prime, there's no minimum purchase to think about, and no consolidating orders -- two-day shipping becomes an everyday experience rather than an occasional indulgence.\" And what started as a risky endeavor has been remarkably successful at getting consumers to change their shopping habits. Plus, in the near-decade since it launched, Amazon has added on new perks to attract subscribers, like Amazon Instant Video, and a e-book lending library for its Kindle e-reader line, as well as offered discounted or special versions aimed at students and (real or fake) moms. At first glance, it might seem pretty amazing that the service managed to hold steady at the same price for that long while adding new services -- the licensing for content for the e-book and video services aren't free, after all. But Prime is actually a pretty lucrative proposition for Amazon. According to a Bloomberg Business Week story from 2010, the service \"broke even in just three months, not the two years the team had originally forecast.\" While the company has been notoriously tight-lipped about the total number of subscribers, statements suggest at least 20 million people have signed up for Prime. And those 20 million people spend a lot more money at Amazon than non-subscribers: A report from market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners found that Prime customers spent an average of $1,340 per year with Amazon versus non-Prime shopper who spent $650 annually. Statistics like that have led some to suggest Amazon should consider actually cutting the price -- or giving it away for free. So why is Amazon considering raising the price? During the earnings call, Amazon cited higher fuel and shipping costs. But there's also consumer behavior that will likely keep Prime a premium package. Right now, when they sign up, consumers are betting that the the savings they reap in shipping costs and possibly subbing Amazon Instant for Netflix or Hulu will outweigh the cost of subscribing. In that calculus, even a $40 dollar bump to Prime subscription fees, which would be a 50 percent price increase, might not seem unreasonable to current subscribers when you consider that Netflix alone will run you $96 per year. And, as suggested by the spending habits of Prime versus non-Prime shoppers, subscribers may feel compelled to use Amazon for as many of their day to day or online purchases as possible to make sure they're getting the most out of their investment: Why leave your house when you can get something delivered to your door? And why shop anywhere else when you can get it delivered fast, for free, from Amazon? It's this conditioning that makes Prime so effective. And if the company is confident it can convince consumers $120 per year is still a good deal for Prime, it's hardly surprising that Amazon is considering changing the price. After all, given the at least 20 million subscribers, a $40 increase could also translate into $800,000,000 in revenue for Amazon.",

        "name": "Amazon wants to send stuff before you order it. Are other retailers doomed? ",
        "content": " A couple weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal happened upon a 27-page patent for what Amazon.com calls \"anticipatory\" or \"speculative\" shipping, which sounds insane. Here's how it works, in a nutshell: The company crunches its streams of data to forecast generally where a certain item might be wanted, sends it on its way, and remotely directs it to the right address as soon as someone actually orders it. On the off chance that the item doesn't actually get ordered, Amazon might discount it to the person at the place it arrived, or even give it away for free. It's all based on probabilities: What people are likely to want at what time, based on user signals like wish lists and past purchases, and the cost/benefit calculus of time saved vs. packages erroneously delivered. If it all works according to plan, Amazon will eat away at one of the last reasons people still go to brick and mortar stores: Immediacy. It might not be able to deliver something to you as fast as you think it, but it could get darn close. As Techcrunch points out, widespread speculative shipping could function like electrical utilities use predictive demand management to send power back and forth across the grid. We shouldn't, though, expect other retailers to lie down and let Amazon become a utility-like monopoly. Wal-Mart is hot on its heels, and the rest of the industry is scrambling to keep up. In their struggle against the Seattle-based empire, retailers are discovering that their physical locations -- increasingly thought of as useless overhead -- are a key advantage. Retail storefronts, after all, are the original hubs for data on what customers want. And big retailers are very familiar with adaptive stocking: Certain branches of different grocery stores offer different items based on the demographics around them (Goya Foods, for example, helps grocery stores understand what Latino nationalities live in the area and what they eat). They stock for the weather, big sporting events, holidays and weird food trends. Now, since more retailers are able to ship from their stores, many -- from Footlocker to Dick's Sporting Goods -- have a network of warehouses and delivery hubs that Amazon's now building from scratch. \"They're trying to do what stores can do intuitively,\" says one retail logistics professional who asked to stay anonymous because he's not authorized to speak publicly. Think about it like this: Brick-and-mortar retailers actually have two points of sale. They can sell something off the shelf or mail it to someone nearby. That creates more flexibility in the amount of inventory they can stock, alleviating the problem of empty racks. \"They'll throw something into a store to create more panache,\" the logistics expert says. \"They're not going to sell it, but they can ship it.\" No matter who comes out on top in the retail wars, the real winners are the people doing the shipping: Amazon's patent provides for working through a contracted \"common carrier,\" like FedEx or UPS. Other services, such as the find-you-where-you-are eBay Now, employ people in cars to shuttle things around from retailers to people willing to pay $5 for almost-instant gratification. As the shipping pileup over Christmas demonstrated, when lots more people are ordering lots more things online, the existing distribution network just doesn't cut it. And sure, that last-mile delivery might be accomplished with drones, but people are still in the picture for now. \"It's going to be a huge courier network that's going to develop from a society that wants everything right away,\" the logistics expert said.

        "name": "How the smartest tech companies plan to autocomplete our lives ",
        "content": " Just like Google autocompletes our search requests, the biggest tech companies appear to be looking to autocomplete our thoughts and actions in ways that almost seem like science fiction. It's not just that companies such as Amazon and Google know what your tastes and preferences are, they are now able to act on them in the real world by delivering real products and services. Consider, for example, that Amazon received a patent in December for something called \"anticipatory shipping.\" In short, Amazon figures out that you've been looking at an item on its Web site and already starts the shipping process so that the item will arrive at your door perhaps hours after you've actually added it to your shopping cart and clicked \"buy.\" (Or, in a really futuristic concept, it might actually arrive before you click buy, if you're the type of person who lingers for hours over customer reviews.) It's all part of removing one of the pain points of the online shopping process -- the long wait between the time you buy and the time you receive the actual product. If Amazon's right, then the whole \"pre-shipment\" concept could be even more revolutionary than the delivery-by-drones concept. Or, consider that Google has patented a geolocation technology for linking ads to free or discounted taxi rides to a restaurant, shop or entertainment venue that advertises on Google. Consider the following hypothetical: You're thinking of going to a restaurant, but it's raining outside, so you decide to just order take-out -- but then you notice an ad on Google for a free taxi ride to a nearby restaurant. Would you go? This concept, of course, is even more relevant, given that Google has invested in Uber and has pioneered the concept of the autonomous car. Now you can imagine this patented technology being used by Google to deliver Uber rides or driverless cars to restaurant-goers and shoppers. Once Google has your location, it can start offering specific services tailored to your GPS coordinates. All of this goes way beyond what we thought was the future just a few years ago -- the \"semantic Web.\" According to the earliest conceptions of the semantic Web, it would soon be possible to know enough about you to deliver the right content at the right time to the right user, thanks to the ability for all data across the Web to \"talk\" to each other. Tim Berners-Lee has referred to this as the \"next Web\" and some have called it \"Web 3.0.\" In our everyday lives, this dream of data talking to each other has already come true. We now have relevant banner ads displayed right next to the text we're reading, curiously creepy e-mails that seem to know what we've been reading and talking about, and the whole genre of \"social ads,\" where your friends appear to be endorsing specific products and services on Facebook. While some of this new technology sounds gloriously disruptive, it also holds the potential for a lot of misunderstandings. In many ways, it seems like \"Minority Report\" and the concept of \"pre-crime.\" In the Tom Cruise movie, a man is wrongly suspected of a \"pre-crime\" and has no way to prove his innocence of something he has never done (or plans to do). In your everyday life, of course, you wouldn't be accused of a pre-crime -- but you might find your front porch piling up with boxes of items you never intended to order, or cars parked outside of your house, engines idling, just waiting to take you for a ride. What's interesting about all of this \"autocomplete\" business is that the most valuable Internet companies will be those that can act on our lives in the real world by delivering physical products and services. It's a lot more valuable to know that someone enjoys a certain type of book and then ships that book to a person than it is to use that knowledge just to throw up some social ads about new book releases. That might place pressure on a company such as Facebook -- which already knows so much about our everyday connections -- to start acquiring companies that can offer what Amazon and Google promise to be able to do one day.

        "name": "Retail in the age of Amazon: Scenes from an industry running scared ",
        "content": " At the National Retail Federation's annual convention, a festival of consumerism housed over the past four days in New York City's soaring Jacob Javits convention center with 30,000 attendees and dozens of lectures on the wizardry of modern commerce, the hottest ticket was for a lunchtime talk about a company that wasn't even there presenting. The enigmatic title: \"Even Amazon Can't Do This Yet.\" \"If you don't think Amazon is a problem for your business, I don't care where you are in the world, you are wrong, you are living under a rock. It's time to come out,\" declared consultant Lee Peterson of WD Partners, to an auditorium so packed that people were standing at the back and sitting in the aisles. \"The very concept of online shopping has become synonymous with Amazon.\" They listened carefully as Peterson laid out the problem, raising camera phones in unison to capture the slides he presented about a customer base that sees little need to frequent physical stores anymore, ever since the advent of Amazon Prime. And it wasn't just that session: Just like much of the Consumer Electronics Show revolves around Apple's products even though the company stopped attending years ago, the chatter at the retail extravaganza all responded to the Seattle company's seismic influence. Since coming onto the scene about a decade ago, Amazon has rapidly turned from an online bookseller into a tentacular behemoth that sells anything and everything cheaper than the companies that produce it, laying waste to everyone else's profit margins. And the retail world is still desperately seeking solutions. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) \"The elephant in the room is Amazon apparently doesn't need to make a profit, where other retailers do,\" said Hamish Brewer, chief executive of JDA Software, in a keynote panel on Sunday. The room curdled, as if Brewer had uttered something unfit for polite company, but Brewer forged ahead. \"If you're going to chase Amazon on price only, I don't think that's going to be a successful strategy. We have to as retailers develop strengths that Amazon doesn't have.\" The retail service industry has gone into overdrive trying to give retailers new ways to fight back. At the convention, flocks of Brazilians and European executives in tailored suits milled about in two giant expo halls, peering at the latest grocery checkout stands and interactive digital signage; tech companies hawked their analytics platforms with the help of pop-ups by Momofuku Milk Bar and Godiva Chocolate. The good news, for them: The playing field is starting to level up. A few years of overhauling technological infrastructure and rethinking distribution is turning traditional retailers into the kinds of entities that have a chance to survive in the new world Amazon has created. The bad news is that they're not focusing on the one thing Peterson pointed out that Amazon doesn't do well: interaction with actual people in actual stores that have traditionally been better at selling merchandise than any newfangled technology could ever manage. If you really want to claw back some market power in the age of Amazon, you need to do a few things: Let your customers discover, purchase and have your products delivered anywhere they please. Make your physical stores into interactive fun zones. And, meanwhile, learn as much about the people buying from you as possible. That overall approach can be encapsulated in one easy buzzword: \"Omnichannelization\" (a.k.a. \"Amazon response\"). Let's break that down. \"Channels\" are the ways in which retailers communicate with their customers, from their storefronts to their Web sites to their mobile applications. \"Omni\" means that you have to use all of them and that consumers need to be able to switch among them, ordering something online to pick up in a store, finding something in a store and getting it delivered to their home, whenever they want -- the only way to compete against a company that makes buying everything as easy as one click. \"From our perspective, it just means additional complexity,\" says David Telford, director of market development with QlikView, one of the hundreds of data companies that have sprung up to help retailers manage the nightmarish logistical challenge that kind of universal availability presents. One of the biggest: eBay, another purely online company that has developed an enterprise arm to manage ordering and deliveries for companies that don't feel up to the task. \"We're the anti-Amazon,\" explains Ted McCaffrey, the eBay division's director of sales. Much of the change has happened behind the scenes, as retailers start turning their physical stores into warehouses that can respond much more quickly to online ordering. A whole lot of it hasn't hit the street yet -- and could totally upend the consumer experience when it finally does. Tata Consultancy Services, for example, presented a \"shoppable window\" with special glass that allows passersby to browse through goods for sale even while the store is closed. A startup called Beehivr builds apps using Apple's Beacon technology to guide people through a store, sending notifications based on whether they're in the dress section or the shoe aisle. A new kind of \"digital watermark\" can be implanted in everything from product packaging to magazine ads and even the audio of a soundtrack playing overhead, allowing retailers to broadcast information to anybody who can be taught that the information is all around them -- if only they would download the app that decodes it. That's one of the biggest X factors in all these new strategies meant to make shopping easier than breathing: Will people actually use them? Take a brand-new technology by Los Angeles-based startup Actv8.me, which has developed a way for television commercials to push alerts to a viewer's phone about the clothing everyone on a show is wearing, or even send coupons for the products in an advertisement. All of it can be personalized, as the networks learn more about the preferences of who's in front of the TV. When it goes live this fall, the program could solve a huge problem for broadcasters: getting people to actually watch the advertisements that generate their revenue. It only works, though, if viewers can be taught what's going on. \"You just hope that consumers understand it,\" said Actv8 CEO Brian Shuster, when asked what he worries about most with the program. \"And if we make it simple enough, they will.\" Those are the new technologies that seem to have real potential. Sometimes, the aspirations for omnichannel retailing seem more akin to fantasy than mere magic -- with limited real-world utility. IBM, for example, had a set of virtual reality glasses that allow shoppers to wander through a store as if in a video game, picking up \"coins\" to redeem for discounts. Taking it one step further, the Indian technology company Wipro showcased a 3-D \"virtual shopping\" app that allows you to \"walk\" through a \"store\" without even leaving your living room, browsing items without the bother of crowds. In the future, haptic technology could even create the sensation of lifting something up to examine it. It might seem odd that someone would choose to simulate a shopping experience remotely rather than either going to a physical store or buying from a typical retail Web site, but salesman Ramakrishna Kashikar argued that video game culture is so pervasive now that there's no telling how far consumers might want to take it. \"The world has become so virtual,\" he said. \"Even Amazon has to do this kind of thing, or else they're going to be wiped out.\" The flip side of all of this: Letting consumers access goods electronically allows companies to learn everything there is to know about your relationship with them, and leverage it to sell you more. \"Loyalty\" programs are ubiquitous now, but they're not just a consumer convenience -- they're also a way for companies to anticipate your needs. Think about going to get a sandwich at Quiznos, and because the store recognizes an app on your phone as you walk through the door, the person behind the counter already knows you like American cheese and no tomatoes. Introducing that level of panoptical intelligence into the customer relationship must be done delicately. A small company that develops customer management software for mid-sized retail operations, Springboard Retail, showed off what a sales associate could know about customer \"Albin Douglas\" when he walks in a store. Since Douglas has bought mostly blue shirts in the past, the associate could recommend a new selection of blue shirts that just went on sale. It's all in the interest of making the in-store experience just as intelligent as the online one. \"A lot of people predicted that brick-and-mortar would go away. We're trying to help them rebuild those relationships,\" explains Springboard's Allen Williams. But isn't it possible that customers might be more creeped out by people knowing things about them that they used to entrust only to a computer? \"They kind of will be, I think,\" Williams acknowledged. Springboard may have the right idea, as consumers get more used to the reality that companies are tracking them everywhere, to put that knowledge in the hands of actual people, who can use it to re-create a sense of community that's been lost in the digital age. Indeed, that was the answer to the question that drew so many convention-goers to Lee Peterson's session on how to beat Amazon. He presented the results of a large survey that showed that consumers find dealing with sales people more frustrating than satisfying, even though face-to-face interaction is the one thing Amazon can't offer. \"To me, that's a travesty,\" Peterson said. \"If you're worried about defeating Amazon, I think this is number one. Invest in people. Hire people who like people. Retail is like having a party in your house every day.\" The rest of the convention, though, seemed to be going in the opposite direction. Most of the innovations on display focused on how to take people out of the process, including: huge vending machines that sell everything from hot meals to Kindles; lockers where you can pick up whatever you've ordered to be delivered to them (eliminating the need for keeping pharmacists on duty round-the-clock, for example); and battery-powered price tags that can be manipulated from a central computer, rather than having someone spend hours changing them one by one. One of the few attempts to put people back in the process came from a three-year-old company called Needle, which recruits \"brand advocates\" to answer questions about products online for $10 to $12 an hour, with the chance to earn a more flexible schedule or free products for good performance. The company had a whole corner of the convention floor, where three live \"advocates\" -- a part-time student, a stay-at-home mom, a freelance photographer -- sat in chairs in front of a giant shrink-wrapped camper van doing their jobs, chatting away with customers for the companies they represent. In another time, they might have dealt with the shopper face to face. In the future, it's as personal as most shopping is likely to get.",

        "content": " Amazon's cloud computing service plays host to some of the most prolific malware distributors on the Internet, security researchers have discovered. Of the 10 sites that pump out malware most frequently, four are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) \u2014 including the number one site, download-instantly.com, according to a threat report published Wednesday by the IT security firm Solutionary. The report comes a week after we learned that hackers allegedly used Amazon's cloud hosting solution as a platform for a botnet that scraped personal information from potentially millions of LinkedIn subscribers. Cloud computing is becoming an attractive way for online criminals to launch attacks against businesses and consumers because of its low cost. It allows users to instantly set up an array of virtual servers that can be ordered to perform both legitimate and abusive functions. Together, the four Amazon-hosted sites accounted for 6 percent of all malware Solutionary found in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the report. Amazon (whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post) is the leading malware host among global hosting providers, followed closely by GoDaddy. The e-commerce giant has taken an active stance on its abusive customers. In 2009, after reports surfaced of a botnet controller living on AWS, the company said it had located the offending malware and shut it down. Amazon also operates an e-mail hotline dedicated to handling reports of AWS abuse. But that hasn't stopped cybercriminals from taking advantage of Amazon's cloud service. In a 2009 presentation at the Black Hat security conference, one consultant demonstrated how AWS's massive computing power could be used as a super-powered password cracker. A typical eight-character alphanumeric password might cost as little as $45 to crack. More recently, AWS was found to be hosting SpyEye, a trojan that let hackers gain access to the online accounts of banking customers. Amazon has argued that it's much better to find the malware on its own systems, where it can be cordoned off and eliminated, rather than have it hosted on the servers of other, less responsive companies. \"We take security very seriously, and investigate all reported vulnerabilities,\" the company writes on its threat reporting page.",

        "content": " Carol Petraitis, an instructional assistant at Calvert Country School, decided that making books about her students was a good way to get their creativity flowing. Unlike most public schools, Calvert Country in Prince Frederick provides individualized learning programs for children with special needs in connection with behavior, autism and functional skills. With encouragement from colleagues, Petraitis published one of her books on Amazon and is donating proceeds to the Autism Project, a nonprofit program in Owings. \"It wasn't meant to be a professional thing. It was just something we wanted to do,\" Petraitis said of herself and colleague Candice Sison, who illustrated the book. The book is \"really just a cute little story,\" Petraitis said. In the summer, when Petraitis talked to her students about the 17-year return of the cicadas - winged insects that live most of their lives underground - most did not know what a cicada was. To educate her students in an interactive way, Petraitis wrote a story about cicadas, with her students' names included in the pages, and read it to the class. \"Cindy the Cicada\" is about a cicada's journey to find a mate and a home to lay her eggs, Petraitis said. Along with Sison, Petraitis wrote the story based on the life cycle of a cicada. The goal of the book was to hone students' \"tremendous imaginations,\" involve them in the story and make learning fun, Sison said. As Sison and Petraitis re-read the story in December to students Cameron Vinson, 10, Noah Wainwright, 9, and Dorian Sprague, 7, Cameron wasn't ready for the story to end. \"I want a sequel,\" Cameron said, adding that he wanted to know what was going to happen to Cindy next. Students with special needs often benefit from having stories read to them repeatedly, in addition to hearing their own names, which directly involves them in the story. Sison said the repetition helps the students retain the information. Petraitis has seen this technique work before with two other books she wrote for her students, one about the Earth's continents and one about the planets. \"I just love . . . to see those small milestones,\" Petraitis said. \"If it takes a story with a couple of pictures [for that to happen], I'm more than happy to do it.\" Petraitis said she contacted another publishing company that wanted $3,395 to publish the small book, which neither Petraitis nor Sison wanted to do. When Petraitis went to Amazon, the company asked for $700. The book was published in October. \"I paid for it to be published and wanted to give something back to the Autism Project,\" Petraitis said. The book is available at Amazon.com for $8.99 in paperback and $4.99 for the Kindle edition. Originally from Brooklyn, N.Y., Petraitis has lived in Calvert for 17 years. She and Sison, a native of Calvert, have been instructional assistants at Calvert Country School for three years. Both plan to write more books together to use in the classroom.",

        "name": "Zappos says goodbye to bosses ",
        "content": " Online retailer Zappos has long been known to do things its own way. The customer-service obsessed company calls its executives \"monkeys,\" has staffers ring cowbells to greet guests, and offers new employees cash to quit as a way to test their loyalty. The Las Vegas-based retailer is now going even more radical, introducing a new approach to organizing the company. It will eliminate traditional managers, do away with the typical corporate hierarchy and get rid of job titles, at least internally. The company told employees of the change at a year-end meeting, Quartz first reported. The unusual approach is called a \"holacracy.\" Developed by a former software entrepreneur, the idea is to replace the traditional corporate chain of command with a series of overlapping, self-governing \"circles.\" In theory, this gives employees more of a voice in the way the company is run. According to Zappos executives, the move is an effort to keep the 1,500-person company from becoming too rigid, too unwieldy and too bureaucratic as it grows. \"As we scaled, we noticed that the bureaucracy we were all used to was getting in the way of adaptability,\" says Zappos's John Bunch, who is helping lead the transition to the new structure. The company has become a force in online shopping as it expanded beyond shoes into apparel, housewares and cosmetics. Amazon, which acquired it in 2009 for $1.2 billion but allows it to be run as a mostly independent unit, does not break out sales for Zappos. The holacracy concept is the brainchild of management consultant Brian Robertson, a serial software entrepreneur who says he launched the idea after realizing he was \"more interested in how we worked together\" than in his own job. The concept has a couple of high-profile devotees \u2014 Twitter cofounder Evan Williams uses it at his new company, Medium, and time management guru David Allen uses it run his firm \u2014 but Zappos is by far the largest company to adopt the idea. At its core, a holacracy aims to organize a company around the work that needs to be done instead of around the people who do it. As a result, employees do not have job titles. They are typically assigned to several roles that have explicit expectations. Rather than working on a single team, employees are usually part of multiple circles that each perform certain functions. In addition, there are no managers in the classically defined sense. Instead, there are people known as \"lead links\" who have the ability to assign employees to roles or remove them from them, but who are not in a position to actually tell people what to do. Decisions about what each role entails and how various teams should function are instead made by a governing process of people from each circle. Bunch does note, however, that at Zappos the broadest circles can to some extent tell sub-groups what they're accountable for doing. Zappos and Robertson are careful to note that while a holacracy may get rid of traditional managers (those who both manage others' work and hold the keys to their career success), there is still structure and employees' work is still watched. Poor performers, Robertson says, stand out when they don't have enough \"roles\" to fill their time, or when a group of employees charged with monitoring the company's culture decide they're not a good fit. Bunch, meanwhile, says that while people have latched on to the idea that Zappos is getting rid of managers, what the company is actually doing is \"decoupling the professional development side of the business from the technical getting-the-work-done side.\" Both also say that while the system lacks traditional managers, it does not mean that leaders won't emerge. If anything, the goal is to get more people to take charge. Still, truly stamping out the corporate hierarchy may be much more difficult than it seems. Bob Sutton, a professor at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and author of the forthcoming book \"Scaling Up Excellence\", says \"show me any group of five human beings or five apes or five dogs, and I want to see the one where a status difference does not emerge. It's who we are as creatures.\" While Sutton says that the instinct to remove as much friction and internal competition is the right idea, \"creating situations where you're clear who has decision authority is important.\" Without that, he says, \"you get more politics.\" Since April, Zappos has moved 10 percent of its employees to the new system. Now that it's official, Bunch expects that the rest of the company's employees will transition by the end of 2014. He acknowledges that it could take up to six additional months, though, for people to fully understand its complexity. \"T here's no two ways around it \u2014 this is a difficult system to grasp. We're so ingrained in the traditional work paradigm.\" Note: Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post.

The FDIC said American Express led consumers to believe that an account protection product would work for up to two years when the benefits usually lasted no more than three months, and it didn't properly explain the enrollment process for a product intended to protect against identity theft. PNC Financial Services Group agreed to pay $35 million to settle claims that minorities were charged more for home loans than similarly qualified white borrowers. National City Bank, which PNC bought in 2008, violated fair lending laws involving loans made to 76,000 blacks and Hispanics between 2002 and 2008, according to the settlement. Italy's Parliament passed a new measure on Web advertising, called the \"Google tax,\" which requires Italian companies to buy Internet ads from locally registered companies, instead of from units based in tax havens such as Ireland, Luxembourg and Bermuda. The bill has stirred controversy, with some lawyers saying it probably violates European Union laws regarding non-discrimination over commercial activity. Target said the Justice Department is investigating the credit and debit card security breach at the retailer. The investigation comes after Target revealed that data connected to about 40 million credit and debit card accounts had been stolen between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15. Investors in the Empire State Building have filed a lawsuit accusing the real estate magnates who took it public of short-changing them $300 million by refusing to sell the iconic skyscraper at a premium price. Peter Malkin and his son Anthony allegedly put their interests ahead of the building's investors by spurning all-cash offers of as much as $2.3 billion for the building and $1.4 billion for Empire State Building Associates, which held the title and master lease. Instead, the Malkins put the landmark building and 17 other properties into Empire State Realty Trust, whose Oct. 1 IPO valued the property at just $1.89 billion and ESBA at just $1.1 billion, the complaint said. BP's argument that a multibillion-dollar settlement over the company's massive 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill shouldn't compensate businesses if they can't directly trace their losses to the spill was rejected by a federal judge. Southwest Airlines, which last hired flight attendants from outside the company in 2011, received applications at a rate of 80 a minute for two hours and five minutes, amassing 10,000 resumes for 750 openings. Delta Air Lines said it will honor tickets sold at incorrect prices on its Web site and through other booking channels after customers snapped up bargains like a round trip to Hawaii for $6.90. The wrong prices were available for a two-hour period. Customers swapped stories of the low fares, such as round-trip flights across the country for $50, on Twitter. Barclays Capital was fined almost $4 million by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for \"systemic failures\" in records retention. The American Bankers Association said it will mount a legal challenge to the \"Volcker rule\" unless U.S. banking regulators soften a provision that restricts bank ownership of certain investments. At issue is a provision of the rule that prohibits banks from owning more than 3 percent of any individual hedge fund or private-equity fund and bars banks from investing more than 3 percent of their total equity capital in private funds. McDonald's shut down a Web site intended to provide employees with work and life guidance after it generated negative publicity. The McResource program was criticized for offering sample budgets for employees that were based on holding two jobs and included no costs for heating, as well as suggestions on what to tip a personal fitness trainer or au pair. The Web site, which was run by an outside company, also reportedly discouraged workers from eating fast food as part of its tips for healthy living. Fidelity National Financial's $2.9 billion acquisition of Lender Processing Services was approved by the Federal Trade Commission after it ordered the companies to sell some assets. Lender Processing Services is a technology company that services the mortgage and real estate industries. Jos. A. Bank rejected a takeover offer from competitor Men's Wearhouse, saying the $1.54 billion bid is too low. Men's Wearhouse said it will \"carefully consider all of our options to make this combination a reality.\" That may include launching a proxy battle. In September, a few months after Men's Wearhouse ousted its founder and chairman, George Zimmer, Jos. A. Bank offered to buy its larger rival for $2.3 billionaire. Men's Wearhouse rejected that offer. The U.S. economy has grown faster than expected in recent months, and energized American shoppers are the reason why. In September, October and November, consumer spending increased faster than it has in any three-month period since the Great Recession ended. That surge comes with an all-too-familiar side note: in order to spend more, Americans are saving less. About 1.3 million long-term unemployed workers were set to lose their federal jobless benefits when the program expired Saturday. The extended benefits, staunchly opposed by Republicans, were left out of the bipartisan federal budget agreement reached this month. The average 30-year fixed-rate loan increased to 4.48 percent from 4.47 percent last week. The average on the 15-year fixed loan rose to 3.52 percent from 3.51 percent. New-home sales in November hit the highest level since 2008 with an annualized rate of 464,000. President Obama signed into law a bipartisan budget deal softening the blow from scheduled spending cuts and a military bill cracking down on sexual assault. The two bills, passed by Congress with broad bipartisan support, constituted a modest step away from gridlock, and both parties cautiously hoped that spirit of cooperation might linger after New Year's Day. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors unveiled a proposal that would limit the scope of its authority to bail out a large financial company on the brink of collapse through its emergency-lending programs. The Fed's proposal would implement a key provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that sought to prevent big bailouts after the Fed extended more than $1 trillion in emergency credit in the financial crisis. Starting on Jan. 1, the monthly amount that commuters can set aside before taxes to spend on mass transit is set to drop from $245 to $130, which for some heavy users could equal nearly $1,000 in higher costs next year.

        "name": "Amazon, UPS offer refunds for Christmas delivery problems; A day after UPS and FedEx were hit by delivery problems that delayed Christmas presents for some, Amazon said it would refund customers. ",
        "content": " Amazon.com and United Parcel Service said Thursday that they would offer refunds to customers who did not receive their Christmas orders on time, after a larger-than-expected surge in last-minute online shopping caught the shipping giant off guard. Customers who failed to get their deliveries by Christmas Day will get $20 gift cards and refunds on shipping charges, Amazon said. UPS also offered refunds on shipping costs. FedEx did not promise refunds but said it would work with people affected. A combination of bad weather, shoppers waiting until the last minute and the overwhelming surge in online buying resulted in some packages not getting under the Christmas tree in time. The wave of shipments was so large that a UPS spokeswoman said \"the volume of air packages in our system exceeded the capacity in our network.\" Customers who ordered shipments via air or internationally are entitled to refunds, spokeswoman Natalie Black said. Wal-Mart and Kohl's, which also have large online operations and reportedly experienced delays, did not respond to requests for comment. Online sales were a bright spot in otherwise gloomy forecasts for the holiday shopping season, according to analysts. The National Retail Federation, a trade group, predicted a 15 percent increase from last year. Holiday sales were expected to rise by only 4 percent. The last-minute surge that clogged UPS systems may mean that online sales exceeded even optimistic forecasts. Final numbers for the holiday shopping season will be out next month. The short holiday season may also have played a part in the delivery crunch. There were six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year than last year. More than 30 million Americans did not start shopping until after Dec. 9, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation. Nearly half of those surveyed said they planned to shop online. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, about 60 million Americans went to the Web for goods, according to the retail group. Kent Hertzog, 34, said he bought his family gifts last week on Amazon.com, expecting them to arrive in time for Christmas. He's still waiting. Hertzog, who lives in Reading, Pa., said he tracked his shipment on the UPS Web site, which showed that the items were delivered at 5 p.m. Wednesday. But he hasn't received them yet. His neighbors were also expecting packages, he said, but their delivery date was pushed back to Thursday. The experience has been frustrating, Hertzog said. He couldn't give his mother her Christmas gift.\"It didn't ruin the day, but now that [Christmas] is over, you still paid for items that are missing,\" Hertzog said. UPS, which had expected to ship more than 132 million packages last week, said that holiday demand was higher than forecast. On its Web site Thursday, the company said it was still \"making every effort to get packages to their destination as quickly as possible.\" In an e-mailed statement,FedEx said it did not experience any \"major service disruptions.\" Neither UPS nor FedEx specified how many packages were delayed. Amazon said its systems worked fine. \"Amazon fulfillment centers processed and tendered customer orders to delivery carriers on time for holiday delivery. We are reviewing the performance of the delivery carriers,\" Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako wrote in an e-mail. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P.

        "name": "Six reasons 2013 was an amazing year for drones ",
        "content": " 2013 was a big year for unmanned vehicles. The word \"drone\" became so common that manufacturers, unhappy with the term's close linkage to targeted strikes in faraway regions, began waging a quiet campaign of their own to stop people from saying it out loud. Yes, it's a silly kind of public relations battle. But the industry has a point: This was the year that we became aware of drones as more than killing machines. We started to understand how they might reshape commerce and transportation and even ethics. Below, six moments in 2013 that pushed drones into the public spotlight. Amazon. Let's get this one out of the way first. The online retailer unveiled its plans to start shipping five-pound packages by delivery drone sometime in the next five years. To its CEO (and Washington Post top dog) Jeff Bezos, it's a sensible step in Amazon's quest to meet our need for instant gratification. To the rest of us, it sounded like an idea out of science fiction. Deliveries in 30 minutes or less? Crazy! But Bezos has been known to make wild investments before. Washington began grappling with drone regulation. Part of the reason why Amazon had to shoot its promotional video abroad was because U.S. regulations don't permit the use of drones for commercial purposes in national airspace. Other countries are considered far ahead of us on that count, and some fear the United States could get left behind as the world dumps $89 billion into aerial drones over the next decade. To catch up, the Federal Aviation Administration came out with a hugely anticipated roadmap in November for safely integrating drones into the civilian airspace. By next summer, the FAA is expected to grant wider permissions to owners of small drones (at or under 55 pounds), with larger commercial drones following in the year(s) after. The FAA named several key sites for drone testing. This technically hasn't happened yet. But sometime within the next week the FAA is set to announce a series of six test ranges across the country that will be used to study how drones will affect our safety and privacy. Twenty-four states ranging from New York to Nevada have applied for the honor. It's a major part of the aforementioned plan to draft new drone regulations. An FAA spokesperson tells me that despite the rapid approach of 2014, the agency is still on track to make a final decision by year's end. Obama vowed to review his policy on drone strikes. The president's controversial use of drones to perform targeted killings drew widespread criticism, particularly in the wake of the 2011 killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born terrorist suspect. In May, Obama gave a speech at the National Defense University in which he admitted that the CIA's drone program, while legal, may not always be \"wise or moral in every instance.\" A Gallup poll two months before showed that the public was deeply divided over the issue, with just 41 percent saying drones should be used against U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism-related activity abroad. In theory, the White House is shifting responsibility for drone strikes to the military \u2014 a move aimed at increasing transparency and accountability. But as the New York Times notes, the transfer has been slow. We learned about a secret program to test drones at Area 51. Speaking of the CIA, a set of documents dropped this year granting us unprecedented insight into the agency's early research on drones during the Vietnam War. As the country kept losing U-2 spy planes, officials started a couple of projects that were ultimately abandoned, but not before producing working prototypes that were flown at Area 51. One design was even fashioned into a kind of missile after the researchers determined that it was too noisy to use for reconnaissance. A Colorado town proposed open season on drones. Deer Trail, Colo., has about 600 residents \u2014 and they're not friendly at all to unmanned vehicles. A town vote scheduled for this month would have made it legal to hunt drones, with licenses and everything. The idea's proponents argue that it simply gives them a way to defend against aerial trespassing. But the proposal also contains bounties for salvaged hardware: Up to $100 for every government-owned drone. Unfortunately, the referendum itself has been postponed and likely won't be held until next year.",

        "name": "Eight ways robots stole our jobs in 2013 ",
        "content": " If we talked about nothing else in 2013 -- and, all right, 2012, too -- we talked about the question of whether technology is going to take all our jobs. This latest surge of the age-old debate seems to have abated, for now, with the anti-robot contingent in America somewhat mollified by the promise that additional automation may be the one advance that allows for manufacturing jobs to return from overseas and relieves humans of the most dangerous and unpleasant tasks. Theoretically, the robotic gospel goes, that talent is then freed up for more fulfilling and productive work. (Hint: The more \"creative\" and \"social\" you are, the more likely you are to survive.) Either way, it's worth looking at the different ways automation began rendering new classes of jobs obsolete this year. The people who mail stuff Back in 2012, Amazon acquired Kiva Systems, a maker of robots that can be programmed to pick up online orders in a warehouse and shuttle them to their departure points. The company now has 1,382 of the machines in three fulfillment centers, which means it eventually may not even have to hire the tens of thousands of temp workers it brings on for the busy holiday season. And if you had any doubts that Amazon could eventually do the same with flying drones, well, let this be a lesson. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) The people who reheat pre-cooked food The nationwide fast-food strikes brought dire warnings from restaurant industry-backed researchers that if line cooks cost too much, they could easily be replaced by robots. That hasn't quite happened yet, but at least one company is working diligently to make it possible. It's reasonable to believe that McDonalds -- which is already replacing cashiers with touch screens in Europe -- would jump at the chance. The people who sell clothes E-commerce has been steadily eating away at brick-and-mortar stores for years now, but what's been cropping up more recently is a breed of business that sees taking retail out of the picture as a point of pride. American Giant, for example: The purveyor of basic, high-quality clothing makes its stuff just outside San Francisco, which it can do affordably because it sells to in-the-know urban sophisticates purely online, skipping the American Apparel-style marketing blitz altogether. That may mean you can get a high-quality, U.S.-made hoodie for a competitive price. It also means that the people who might otherwise have sold it to you don't have jobs. The people who stock shelves and return shopping carts Not all labor-saving innovations are high-tech. The discount supermarket Aldi -- which is owned by the same corporate parent as the more bourgeois Trader Joe's -- keeps payroll down by requiring a 25-cent deposit for shopping carts so employees don't have to return them, and stocking shelves with boxes full of goods rather than placing the individual items in neat rows. Again, great for shoppers on a budget -- at the cost of employment. People who drive trucks Autonomous vehicle technology is accelerating, and for now, is focused on passenger vehicles. But the real labor shortage is in long-haul trucking, and as my colleague Brian Fung pointed out, that's a job that might be more safely filled by a remotely-controlled robot that never gets tired or lost. Which just means that the 5.7 million people who do the job now will have to find a new way to make a living. People who operate farm equipment The history of agriculture has been one long tale of automation, to the point where almost nobody works on farms in America anymore. The exception was supposed to be people who operated the machines that replaced people who tilled the soil and harvested the crops by hand. But even they're not safe anymore, with the advent of tractors that can be piloted around the fields by computer or even programmed with the right coordinates and set loose, like a gigantic dirt-treading Roomba. The people who make iProducts After years of close scrutiny for the working conditions in its factories, Foxconn -- which makes most of Apple's computers, phones, and tablets -- decided to swap people out for machines as much as possible. The process hasn't been as quick or as easy as anticipated, but with wages rising in China, Foxconn has little choice but to keep cranking out the one-million-strong army of \"Foxbots\" it promised back in 2010. The people who do low-level lab work In North Carolina's Research Triangle Park, a company called LabCorp is hard at work developing machines to sort and split blood samples, which is just one of hundreds of thousands of menial laboratory jobs that pay decent money but could more efficiently be done by robots. We may be able to add bartenders next year, but at this point, it still seems that man has an advantage over machines in making a decent Manhattan.",

        "content": " Chevron's battle in the Amazon goes on, as a lawsuit by 47 villagers in Ecuador to seize the oil giant's Canadian assets can proceed, a Canadian court ruled. In 2011, a South American court found the company liable for three decades of soil and water pollution near oil wells that ruined the health and livelihoods of Amazon rain-forest dwellers. Since then, Ecuadoran farmers and fishermen have tried to collect $19 billion in environmental damages from San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron, the world's third-largest oil company. The award was reduced to $9.5 billion from $19 billion Nov. 12 by the National Court of Justice, Ecuador's highest tribunal. \"After all these years, the Ecuadoran plaintiffs deserve to have recognition and enforcement of the Ecuadoran judgment heard on the merits in an appropriate jurisdiction. At this juncture, Ontario is that jurisdiction,\" the ruling states. Ocwen Financial, the largest U.S. nonbank mortgage servicer, was ordered to provide $2 billion in help to underwater borrowers to resolve allegations of misconduct that led to thousands of people losing their homes. Ocwen Financial must reduce loan balances for struggling homeowners and refund $125 million to foreclosed borrowers under an agreement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and dozens of banks must face a lawsuit accusing the social-media company of misleading investors about its health before its $16 billion initial public offering, a federal judge said. At issue is whether Facebook should have disclosed internal projections on how increased mobile usage and product decisions might reduce future revenue. BP will drill about 300 wells to flush out gas trapped deep under the Omani desert over the next 15 years in a $16 billion project. The Khazzan project aims to extract about 1 billion cubic feet per day of gas using hydraulic fracturing technology developed in the United States. The first criminal trial produced by the Justice Department's sweeping probe of BP's massive 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico ended with a jury convicting Kurt Mix, a drilling engineer, of trying to obstruct investigators by deleting text messages from his cellphone. Hewlett-Packard chief executive Meg Whitman is getting a raise as she enters the third year of her attempt to turn around the slumping personal-computer and printer maker. Whitman's annual salary is soaring to $1.5 million from the $1 that she settled for during her first two years on the job. Microsoft, which is seeking a successor for chief executive Steve Ballmer, said it anticipates completing the search in the early part of 2014. The company has identified more than 100 candidates, talked with several dozen and has since focused on about 20. Amazon workers in Germany went on strike at the height of holiday sales in a dispute over pay and conditions. Google has been accused by Canada's Competition Bureau of abusing its dominant position among online search engines, joining U.S. and European antitrust authorities in challenging the Web giant's practices. General Motors announced that it will invest $1.3 billion to upgrade plants in three states: Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. 3M, a maker of goods from electronics to dental braces, saw its biggest stock price jump in two years, to $131.39 a share, after increasing its quarterly dividend by 35 percent and saying it will spend as much as $10 billion on acquisitions through 2017 and repurchase as much as $22 billion of its shares. The Secret Service is investigating a suspected theft of at customers' credit- and debit-card data at Target. Payment card data was stolen from an unknown number of Target customers starting on the busy Black Friday weekend. CashCall, an Anaheim, Calif.-based short-term money lender, and its chief executive, J. Paul Reddam, were sued and accused of abusive lending practices by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The lawsuit is the regulator's first against a firm that makes its loans via the Internet. Reddam owned the racehorse I'll Have Another, which last year won the first two legs of the Triple Crown. The Justice Department and the SEC charged two Seattle men with 35 counts of insider trading relating to Microsoft options. One of the men, Brian Jorgenson, is a former senior portfolio manager at Microsoft. The other, Sean Stokke, is an online trader. Research firm eMarketer expects spending on mobile advertisements to hit nearly $9.6 billion in the United States this year, up from $4.4 billion in 2012 and from less than $1.6 billion in 2011. Mobile ads represent nearly 23 percent of the money companies spend on digital advertising, or ads that people see on their computers, tablets and mobile phones. That's up from about 12 percent last year and less than 5 percent in 2011. Darden Restaurants said it will either spin off or sell Red Lobster, one of its oldest and biggest brands. The company also plans to stop building Olive Gardens and to slow growth at LongHorn Steakhouse. Economy GDP, in the third and final revision of third-quarter numbers, rose at a 4.1 percent annual rate in the July-through-September quarter. The government had previously estimated growth at 3.6 percent. That marks the second-best quarter for growth since before the recession in 2007 (the fourth quarter of 2011 logged 4.9 percent). U.S. factories increased output in November for the fourth straight month, led by a surge in auto production. Factory production rose 0.6 percent in November after a 0.5 percent gain in October, the Federal Reserve said Monday. Washington Congress declared a holiday truce in the budget wars Wednesday, sending President Obama a blueprint for funding the government through 2015. But the next skirmish was already on the horizon: an election-year fight over the national debt. The budget deal that passed the Senate on Wednesday amounts to a handshake agreement to avoid a government shutdown when a temporary funding measure expires Jan. 15. However, the accord does not address the need once again to raise the debt limit, setting up a potentially complicated confrontation in late February or early March. The SEC levied a record $3.4 billion in sanctions in enforcement cases in the latest fiscal year, up 10 percent from the year before. The sanctions were boosted in part by a more than $600 million settlement with a unit of hedge fund SAC Capital, $525 million with BP and a $200 million fine of JPMorgan Chase. The FDA will revise sweeping food safety rules proposed earlier this year after farmers complained the rules could hurt business. Those would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and animals stay out of fields. Food manufacturers would have to submit food safety plans to the government. President Obama has nominated Timothy Massad, an official at the Treasury Department, to be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's next chairman, but a confirmation hearing in the Senate will not take place before early next year. Transitions Lockheed Martin, the largest U.S. weapons maker, said chief executive Marillyn Hewson also will become the Bethesda-based company's chairman after Robert Stevens retires Dec. 31. Hewson, who ranked No. 4 in Fortune magazine's list of the most powerful women in U.S. business for 2013, will become chairman a year after she was appointed chief executive.",

        "name": "Google is hoarding robots. Here's what they may be planning. ; The company has acquired eight robotics companies this year. We explain why. ",
        "content": " Just when it seemed like Amazon's concept for a drone-powered fleet of quadricopters for Amazon Prime Air was going to be the most outlandish idea of the year from the tech sector, along comes the news that Google just acquired Boston Dynamics, the company best known for creating DARPA Atlas robots and \"creepy galloping robots\" like the BigDog and the Wild Cat. What the heck is going on here? It would be easy to think that this move was just another bit of Silicon Valley-style one-upmanship, this time between Google CEO Larry Page and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. By acquiring a robotic animals company with just days to go before the world settles in for the winter holidays, Google gets the final say for the year and cements its reputation as being one of the most innovative companies in the world. Except that robotics appears to be a very serious initiative at Google rather than something announced after repeated viewings of the \"60 Minutes\" drones segment with Jeff Bezos. Boston Dynamics is the eighth robotics company acquired by Google this year, with other companies acquired involved in similar activities including robots capable of loading and unloading delivery trucks. One company bought by Google, Bot & Dolly, makes a robotic camera system that was used to film Clooney and Bullock in \"Gravity,\" Alfonso Cuaron's remarkable film about outer space. The head of the new robotics division at Google is Andy Rubin, the same person who spearheaded the development of the Android operating system at Google. Rubin himself has a personal interest in robotics and tweeted out that \"the future is looking awesome!\" just after Google bought Boston Dynamics. It now appears that Rubin took on robotics as another \"moonshot\" business for Google, the same way that driverless cars were a \"moonshot\" business. So the conventional wisdom that Google's robots would be factory drone-workers, assembling things such as Android phones and then delivering them door-to-door to customers, doesn't seem to make sense. You don't need a WildCat running at 40 mph to do that. That's like bringing a gun to a knife fight. So if not for a drones-inspired initiative, what could Google's robotic menagerie possibly be for? Remember Google's mission statement is to \"organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\" So here's another admittedly outlandish idea. Google is using these robots as literal foot soldiers in the race to organize the world's information. These robots, once they've been outfitted with cameras, could be sent anywhere in the world as part of a new Google Maps initiative. It would essentially be Google StreetView without the cars. Or, perhaps Google's driverless cars would drop off the robotic dogs and cats at the edge of a mountain range or arctic glacier and wait for them to come back after trudging around for awhile. Another scenario is that these robotic animals could help to bring Internet access to remote locations. Remember the Google Loon project, which would use helium balloons to bring Internet connectivity to hard-to-reach locales? Well, what about a network of robots connected with WiFi routers that are able to go anywhere, do anything, to bring the wireless Internet to every single corner of the globe? That's why it doesn't make sense that Google would try to do something that doesn't fit into a longer-term strategy, such as creating some kind of vast cyborg army just for the lulz. Once you hook up Google's Android army to Ray Kurzweil's artificial intelligence initiatives at Google, though, watch out. The future appears to be one of hyper-intelligent computing machines that are the physical and mental equals of humans, capable of going anywhere on the planet. (Or perhaps into outer space as in the film \"Gravity\") The innovation ball is now back in Amazon's court. Google has shown us once again that no idea is too big, no idea is too outlandish, if you want to be considered the most innovative company in the world.

As part of AWS China Region Cloud's limited preview, to be launched in 2014, some China-based and multinational companies with customers in China will be able to use AWS. These companies can start applying for access on Amazon's site. Until now, customers in China had been using AWS services based in other global regions \u2014 the United States, Europe, South America, for instance. AWS's China Region Cloud would allow customers to run applications and store data on infrastructure based in China, which could be useful to businesses required to store their data in the country, according to Amazon. AWS China has partnered with local businesses including ChinaNetCenter and SINNET to provide bandwidth, infrastructure and network capabilities, and the unit has offices in China. Amazon signed a memorandum of understanding with the Beijing municipal government and the government of the Ningxia Hui Nationality Autonomous Region in Western China, agreeing that AWS China would use facilities in both areas. The Ninxia Hui Nationality Autonomous Region's government plans to use AWS cloud services to power its public service applications, according to Amazon. AWS China is also working on an a business incubation program in Shanghai encouraging start-ups to use its cloud services. (Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P.

        "name": "Amazon's German workers strike as holiday orders peak ",
        "content": " BERLIN - Hundreds of Amazon.com workers in Germany went on strike Monday, just as pre-Christmas sales were set to peak, in a dispute over pay and conditions that has raged for months. Germany is Amazon's second-biggest market, behind the United States, and sales there grew almost 21 percent in 2012, to $8.7 billion, a third of its overseas total. Amazon took its most daily orders in Germany last Dec. 16, when almost 4 million articles were bought, with shipments peaking Dec. 17. Amazon, which employs 9,000 warehouse staff members in Germany plus 14,000 seasonal workers at nine distribution centers, said that 1,115 employees joined the strike at three sites but that there have been no delays to deliveries. \"Our customers can continue to rely on us for the prompt delivery of their Christmas presents,\" a spokeswoman said, adding that Amazon uses its whole European logistics network during the Christmas period to ensure delivery times. The Verdi union said that up to 700 workers joined the strike in Amazon's logistic center in Bad Hersfeld, plus 500 to 600 in Leipzig. For the first time, the union also called a strike in Graben, where Verdi said 600 workers took part. \"The Amazon system is characterized by low wages, permanent performance pressure and short-term contracts,\" Verdi board member Stefanie Nutzenberger said in a statement. A delegation of German workers was set to rally at Amazon's headquarters in Seattle along with U.S. unions. In addition, workers in Amazon's center in the German town of Werne will protest Tuesday, while strikes are expected to continue all week in Leipzig and until Wednesday in Bad Hersfeld. \"Amazon must realize it cannot export its anti-union labor model to European shores. We call on the company to come to the table and sign a global agreement that guarantees the rights of workers,\" said Philip Jennings of the global trade union UNI. Verdi organized several short stoppages this year to try to force Amazon to accept collective-bargaining agreements in the mail-order and retail industry as benchmarks for workers' pay at Amazon's German distribution centers. But Amazon's German country head Ralf Kleber said the company would not bow to pressure from striking workers and was more worried about bad weather hurting Christmas deliveries, he said in an interview last month. Kleber said that Amazon pays warehouse workers well according to the standards of the logistics industry, starting at $13.11 an hour, and does not think the more generous terms of the mail-order and retail sector are justified. Amazon recently announced that it would build three new logistics centers in Poland and two in the Czech Republic, prompting speculation that it could seek to shift work across the border from strike-hit centers in Germany. But Kleber said Amazon expected to keep expanding in Germany, including eventually delivering fresh groceries, too. Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.

        "name": "Independent bookstores turn a new page on brick-and-mortar retailing; Learning to live with e-books and e-marketers, indies prove there\u2019s still a place for brick-and-mortar retailers. ",
        "content": " Bookstores are terminally ill. Borders? Dead. Barnes & Noble? Life support. Amazon is king. E-books are the present and the future. Have tablet, will read. But in downtown Frederick, Md., Marlene and Tom England are defying the future: They recently opened the Curious Iguana bookstore. It carries books printed on paper. Nonfiction. Poetry. Short stories. That seems insane, right? Some people strolling by certainly think so. \"I've heard them say: 'A bookstore? Who would open up a bookstore these days?' \" Marlene said. \"I mean really, the door is open. I can heeaaaaaaaar you.\" Marlene has not ventured outside to offer the doomsayers a retort, but if she did, it would be this: Independent bookstores are not dead. In fact, in some of the country's most urbane and educated communities, they are making a comeback. In an e-tailing world, their resurgence is driven by e-book growth that has leveled off, dyed-in-the-wool print lovers who won't (or can't) abandon page flipping, a new category of hybrid reader (the latest mystery, digital; the latest John Irving, print) and savvy retailers such as the Englands, positioning their stores squarely in the buy-local movement and as a respite from screens. The American Booksellers Association, which represents independent bookstores, says its membership \u2014 it hit a low of 1,600 in 2008 \u2014 has grown 6.4 percent in 2013, to 2,022. Sales were up 8 percent in 2012, and those gains have held this year. In the District, sales at Politics and Prose, where President Obama and his daughters went Christmas shopping last month, have grown each of the past few years. Its owners pondered an additional outlet in Georgetown, but the original idea for a location fell through. Nationally, while there are still indie bookstores shutting their doors, unable to hold on against the tough head winds, there are more stores opening than closing. Word, the popular Brooklyn indie, just opened a new branch at an old Burger King in Jersey City. Bookbug, in Kalamazoo, Mich., has doubled its size. Novelist Ann Patchett opened a store in Nashville. There are new openings in St. Louis, in Durham, N.C., and beyond. \"We just never bought into the sky-is-falling mentality,\" Marlene England said. \"You see the headlines, but you have to dig deep to see what's really happening.\" The indie resurgence became publishing's central narrative this year. Publishers Weekly, the industry's trade bible, last month named Oren Teicher, chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, and his group's board as its person of the year, an honor previously given to \"Fifty Shades of Grey \" author E.L. James and Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, the owner of The Washington Post and a villain to indie booksellers. \"We are a lot like Mark Twain: The rumors of our death are a little bit exaggerated,\" Teicher said. \"We have been counted out for a very long time.\" Twenty-five years ago, independents were supposed to vanish when Waldenbooks showed up in malls. They were supposed to vanish when Borders and Barnes & Noble came along with endless selection and comfy chairs. They were supposed to vanish when Costco started selling the latest Doris Kearns Goodwin . They were supposed to vanish when Amazon perfected low prices and fast shipments \u2014 not just for books but even for rowboats, meaning nobody would ever have to leave the house again to shop. \"I think what we're seeing is that the inevitable death of any kind of physical retailing was a gross exaggeration,\" said Laura J. Miller, a Brandeis sociology professor and author of \"Reluctant Capitalists: Bookselling and the Culture of Consumption .\" \"There are a lot of reasons people like going to bricks-and-mortar stores, especially to bookstores that are offering something more than just a convenient shopping experience.\" The Englands' objective when they opened the Curious Iguana was to offer something more. They are experienced in the art of throwback retailing. They own Dancing Bear Toys and Gifts, a popular downtown Frederick toy store specializing in toys without batteries. Even in the face of Xboxes, flying toys and children snatching their parents' iPhones to play games, the Dancing Bear's sales have increased every year. \"We think there's a desire by many to go back to a very simple time,\" Tom England said. \"Kids are starting to play Risk again. People want to touch things. They want to be a little low-tech.\" The Englands were pondering opening another toy store in a different downtown, but they love Frederick and realized something special was happening there \u2014 a rebirth fueled by upscale food, high-end antiques and cute cafes. Their toy store's book section was booming, so they thought of opening a kids bookstore. But people around town pushed them to open a bookstore for general interest. They visited Politics and Prose one morning. It was packed. They saw statistics showing that indie stores' sales were growing again. And so they took a huge gamble: They moved their toy store off the main street and around the corner, putting the Curious Iguana in its spot. The walls are a warm purple. Edison lights hang from the ceiling. The hardwood floor creaks. And they gave the store a larger mission, too \u2014 sharing a portion of the proceeds with international nonprofit organizations. Sales, the Englands say, are higher than they expected. One recent Saturday afternoon the store was packed with about two dozen customers. \"We need intimate, small places like this that care about the books they pick,\" said Lisa Solomon, a Frederick resident holding several children's books. \"This isn't just a bookstore. It's more than that.\" Ryan Young, 38, dropped $130 on cookbooks, kids titles and some other hardcovers. She said something that many book buyers would be afraid to utter in an indie store: \"I'm an Amazon Prime member.\" She also admitted to owning and enjoying a Kindle. Lightning did not strike her. That's because she also said this: \"Having a book in my hands \u2014 nothing stacks up to that.\" Young is an emerging positive for indie bookstores: a hybrid reader. About 64 percent of U.S. book buyers prefer reading in both print and digital, according to the Codex Group, which regularly surveys readers. Young reads series mysteries on her Kindle, but literary titles come home in print. Industry statistics show that e-book sales are largely tilted toward genre reading, a trend playing out in Young's life. \"There has to be a value in both,\" she said. \"There are books on my bookshelves that are like my friends. You can go back to them over and over again.\" Marlene England is not offended about the Amazon.com remark. \"It doesn't have to be an either-or,\" she said. \"You don't have to feel guilty for buying e-books. We all do it \u2014 for convenience, for travel, whatever.\" E-books, however, have not come to overwhelm bookselling as many experts predicted five years ago. Statistics from earlier this year showed that e-book sales were up 5 percent in the first quarter, compared with 28 percent in 2012 and 159 percent in 2011. \"The growth curve really has flattened, so that's good for us,\" said Bradley Graham, a former Washington Post reporter who owns Politics and Prose with his wife, Lissa Muscatine. But many independent bookstore owners, including Graham, concede that e-books are a big part of the industry's future, so they are embracing the technology. In partnership with Kobo, an Amazon competitor, Politics and Prose and other independent bookstores are selling the company's e-readers and e-books in exchange for a small cut of sales. Graham says the partnership hasn't yielded meaningful revenue. More promising, he said, are the store's other ancillary offerings \u2014 daily author readings, dozens of paid classes, and book-oriented trips. The store recently added beer and wine sales for in-store events. Still, publishing experts say that independents might be fighting for their lives again five or 10 years down the road. College students today \u2014 the book buyers of tomorrow \u2014 are finding a heavy emphasis on digital textbooks in the classroom, and there is a risk they won't ever become hybrid book buyers. Also, Amazon shows no sign of giving indies any relief on what store owners consider predatory pricing, especially on key titles they need to push. Donna Tartt's new novel, \"The Goldfinch ,\" is selling for $30 at Curious Iguana. Amazon is selling it for $15.41. And then there's Barnes & Noble. While the Borders demise was good for indie sales, a Barnes & Noble collapse would be catastrophic for the publishing industry, which depends heavily on the company's enormous bookselling footprint to move huge inventories, including bestsellers that help finance the more literary offerings that indies typically stock. \"I think the independents have been given a break for now,\" said Al Greco, who studies publishing at Fordham University. The Englands know the risks. \"We knew exactly what we're getting into,\" Tom said. And besides, Marlene said, \"if it all fails, Curious Iguana is a great name for a bar.\"  mike.rosenwald@washpost.com",

        "content": " When Jeffrey P. Bezos revealed to CBS's Charlie Rose that Amazon.com was planning for a fleet of whirring octocopters to deliver everyone's next iPhone case, the video that went along with it showed a prototype drone rising lazily off the ground and floating across green, open fields to reach its destination. It could've been anywhere \u2014 sunny California, maybe, or somewhere near Seattle. But it was actually neither of those places. Turns out it wasn't even in the United States. Spokespeople for Amazon and the Federal Aviation Administration have confirmed that the company chose an international location for its concept video after FAA restrictions prevented them from shooting here. Exactly which lucky country got a cameo is still a mystery; neither official would talk specifics. Drone policy watchers say Canada would have been an attractive option \u2014 it's not far from Amazon's home base, Seattle, and the rules governing unmanned aircraft are a little more relaxed there. \"I can also imagine maybe a small eastern European country being a good candidate,\" says Timothy Reuter, who heads the DC Area Drone User Group. The fact that Amazon had to leave the country to make the video underscores how slowly U.S. officials have embraced the policy challenge. It also offers a concrete example of what the country stands to lose, as the market for civil drone use picks up globally. They've been criticized before for lagging on their new set of drone guidelines; it won't be until 2015 that the FAA finally integrates small drones into the national airspace, with full-on commercial drones getting addressed sometime later, according to a governmental plan released last month. The current regime makes exceptions for hobbyists and those who receive a special certificate from the FAA. Sometime before the end of the month, the agency is expected to announce a number of test sites it'll use to assess the impact of unmanned vehicles on safety and security.",

        "content": " Amazon.com's Prime Air service promises to get goodies to your door in less than 30 minutes. But what puts the company in a position to make that offer is a responsive supply chain. Already, under its two-day shipping policy, Amazon has to make sure each of its warehouses has enough of the items everyone wants, or else a sufficiently robust backhaul option that can fulfill requests on short notice. Either way, Amazon is hugely dependent on air cargo. And it's the part of the supply chain that customers don't interact with that stands to be affected most by drone technology. FedEx chief executive Fred Smith has been discussing the use of unmanned aircraft in backhaul shipping for some time. Rather than the flying cigars of today, though, Smith thinks future cargo planes will favor a \"blended wing\" design that looks like a cross between a traditional airliner and a stealth bomber. Unlike the fragile-looking copter drones that are currently available to hobbyists (and that Amazon sees as the key to Prime Air), unmanned blended wings are the object of intense research by massive aerospace companies with real money to spend. Boeing's X-48C is a blended-wing unmanned aircraft that concluded an eight-month flight-test program with NASA earlier this year. That's being followed by research into a larger version of the X-48 that's capable of transonic speeds. Planes like these would have much more room for goods than current aircraft, making air freight more economical. Even today's jetliners mostly run themselves, with human pilots stepping in only to perform takeoff and landing. A shift to unmanned aircraft would still require pilots in the short term to fly planes remotely; but in the long run, this technology could become a way for FedEx to eliminate many of its pilots. Asked about the potential for a fully autonomous fleet, a FedEx spokesperson said the company \"support[s] our pilots completely.\" Meanwhile, UPS is reportedly weighing a service to compete with Prime Air. A company spokesperson, however, wouldn't discuss its backhaul operations. \"We're always looking for the best technology,\" said UPS' Kara Ross. The secrecy is hardly a surprise. Cargo companies are waiting for the Federal Aviation Administration to finish drafting a set of guidelines for integrating commercial drones into the nation's airspace, a process that isn't expected to wrap for several years. But that isn't keeping companies from making as many preparations as they can.",

        "name": "Forget the doubters, commercial drones are here to stay ",
        "content": " While obviously there are a lot of technological, legal and regulatory hurdles to overcome before we ever see a fleet of Amazon Prime Air octocopters taking off from distribution centers across America and making door-to-door deliveries, the momentum behind the commercial drone revolution continues to build. There are now over 25,000 DIY drone enthusiasts in America, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) prototypes already exist for a number of commercial applications. By some estimates, commercial drones could boost the U.S. economy by $13.6 billion and create 70,000 new jobs within just a few years. Once the FAA finally rules on potential applications for commercial drones (expected in late 2015), it will be time for the training wheels to come off the domestic drone bandwagon. As wacky and futuristic as Amazon's vision for Prime Air may sound, it's actually an idea that dates back to at least 2009. FedEx, for example, has even tentatively explored plans for a giant fleet of commercial unmanned drones to deliver packages. That's right -- the entire FedEx fleet would be comprised of robotic drones. These unmanned delivery vehicles would be more along the lines of massive 777 cargo freighter drones than Amazon octocopters, but you get the idea: the logistics business is looking for a faster, cheaper delivery model and drones are going to be involved somehow. There's even been talk of drone fleets flying in bird-like formations over cities and then disassembling as they go about their final delivery routes. In order to think about drones the way Jeff Bezos thinks about drones, just imagine any delivery service being reinvented as a drone delivery service, where robots replace humans. In densely populated urban areas, takeout orders are one example of how consumer drones could revolutionize different business models. In early 2012, for example, there was much speculation about \"TacoCopters\" eventually being able to deliver tacos to young tech workers in the San Francisco Bay Area using a fleet of quadricopters. But think about it -- any urban area full of bike messengers and pizza delivery guys could benefit from the 30 minutes or less approach of a Jeff Bezos. At some point, it's possible to imagine going out to a baseball game or music festival on a warm summer day, pressing a button on your smartphone, and having a drone deliver a nice cold beer to your seat within minutes. In South Africa, for example, they already have beer drones. So what other business models might profit from consumer drones? Imagine personal security drones buzzing around your home, keeping it safe while you're away on vacation and capable of interacting with police and fire department first-responders. There's also been talk of how drones could lead to massive new efficiencies in the agricultural sector by giving farmers and ranchers the ability to monitor vast areas. Oil and gas exploration teams could deploy drones to survey remote areas. Real estate agents could use them to create videos of new properties on the market. And, of course, Hollywood film directors could create new types of action shots using drones capable of recording video from unique angles. And you wouldn't even have to be a Hollywood director to take advantage of this last capability. What if, for example, you were to combine the GoPro video revolution (recently featured by Anderson Cooper on \"60 Minutes\" in November) with the technological capabilities of a drone, such that you had a personal GoPro video drone following you around and doing your bidding when it wasn't otherwise filming your every move? That might sound insane, but that's the vision from former Wired editor Chris Anderson, who recently landed $30 million in VC financing for his drones company, 3D Robotics, and has been at the forefront of advancing something he's calling an \"autonomous personal robot.\" As Anderson recently outlined in a cover story for Wired , the \"autonomous personal robot\" is essentially a \"pet bird\" that follows you around wherever you are. And that's not all. Commercial drone technology is an exponential technology, meaning that we'll continue to see massive improvements in what they're capable of. They'll shrink in size and become more powerful with every passing year. Once the FAA rules on commercial drones in 2015, we'll likely see an explosion of commercial drone concepts, as those 25,000 DIY drone hobbyists in America are able to unlock their innovation in pursuit of new business ideas. Drones will no longer be an underground hobbyist activity. In the end, that might just be the future that Jeff Bezos envisions -- he may not really plan to fly all those Amazon octocopters, but he's laying the groundwork for innovation so that Amazon can benefit from all the size and scale advantages once operating a commercial drone fleet becomes economically feasible and legally possible. One thing is certain, though -- Jeff Bezos just raised the bar for what to expect at next year's TED conference. Flying robot swarms are so 2012. Related: Rounding up the Amazon drone skepticism",

        "name": "Amazon drones are a fun gimmick, but ground vehicles are the future of retail ",
        "content": " The Internet is currently obsessed with Amazon's plan to deliver packages via unmanned \"octocopters.\" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos believes the technology may be ready within five years, and that they could enable packages to be delivered in as little as 30 minutes. Aerial drone technology could revolutionize the retail business, threatening not only other online retailers but some brick-and-mortar ones as well. But flying robots probably won't be the only automated delivery technology entering the market in the coming decade. They'll have to compete against self-driving vehicles that drive around on the ground. And ground-based delivery robots may be the winners in the long run. \"The ones on the ground should be the long-term winner because they're going to be more efficient,\" says Brad Templeton, chair of networks and computing at Singularity University who has been writing about the potential of self-driving vehicles, including delivery robots, for more than five years. And surprisingly, Templeton argues, ground-based delivery robots will be \"able to go to more places.\" Templeton argues that if you look at satellite pictures, \"you'll find that even as a human being, you're not sure how to land on peoples' yards.\" Obstructions like trees, power lines, tall buildings, and the like can make it tricky to land in some parts of town. High winds or other adverse weather conditions can make drone deliveries even more challenging. The problem of piloting a self-driving vehicle is comparative simple. And once ground-based vehicles don't need human drivers, they can be made extremely small, simple, and cheap. Templeton envisions \"robots the size of a dog\" driving around urban streets at modest speeds. The small size, low speed, and lack of human passengers means that safety wouldn't be a big issue. That might allow the technology to be introduced earlier than full-scale self-driving cars. Flying and driving robots have different strengths and weaknesses. Bezos says you won't be able to have table saws or kayaks delivered by Amazon's drones. But these items could easily be delivered by a self-driving ground vehicle. On the other hand, a ground-based vehicle is never going to get to its destination quite as quickly as a flying one can. So if consumers want their products in a hurry, Amazon Prime Air may be the best option. The Amazon.com of the future might offer customers a choice between getting 60-minute ground delivery for free or 20-minute air delivery for an extra fee. One challenge for both delivery types is what to do with the packages upon arrival. Here, Templeton argues that the flying machines might have an advantage: they can drop packages in peoples' back yards, where they're less likely to be stolen. They could drop them on the roofs of apartment buildings, which would only be accessible to building residents. Ground vehicles, on the other hand, might be given a code to open customers' garage doors, though that could raise security issues of its own. But in the long run, Templeton predicts, this problem will go away entirely as delivery companies increasingly deliver packages directly into the hands of recipients. With delivery times measured in minutes rather than days, vehicles could go directly to the customer's physical location. That might mean delivering packages to users while they're at home. It could also mean using the GPS on the customer's phone to visit the customer wherever he happens to be when a package is ordered: at work, the dentist's office, or a child's school. Drones, Templeton says could \"get rid of this idea that we deliver on the delivery company's schedule and deliver on your schedule instead.\" Most likely, the future of retail will use a mix of ground- and air-based delivery vehicles. Air-based vehicles make for better television. But the lower cost, higher capacity, and greater reliability of ground-based vehicles means they're likely to be the workhorse of 21st Century retail.",

        "name": "Everything you need to know about Amazon's new delivery drones ; Explaining the retail giant's new proposal, in 12 questions. ",
        "content": " You may have heard that unmanned drones will eventually be making your Amazon deliveries. The idea seems so crazy, it's bound to raise a few questions. Is it really possible? What kind of obstacles will Amazon chief executive (and Washington Post owner) Jeffrey Bezos have to overcome? And how will his plan shape the future of drone technology? Answers to these and more are below. First things first. What does Amazon have in mind? In as little as five years, Amazon says, it's going to field a fleet of drones that will deliver anything you order \u2014 so long as it's under five pounds \u2014 in minutes. What? That's crazy. How would that even work? Conveniently, Amazon has these giant distribution centers scattered around the country. Most of the company's deliveries start out from these facilities; the drones would simply be cutting out the truck drivers who deliver your packages today. Jeff Bezos has lost it, hasn't he? You'd have to be crazy not to think that drone deliveries might play some role in the future of shipping. Amateurs \u2014 and some companies, too \u2014 have already proven very willing to take on the challenge. So it's only natural that Amazon also sees an opportunity here. Okay, maybe he's not crazy. But what kind of opportunity are we talking about? Traditional retailers compete on the strength of their products. But Amazon, increasingly, is competing on the basis of time \u2014 fulfilling our wishes as close to instantaneously as possible. The drone strategy promises to cut what's currently a one- or two-day shipping window down to 30 minutes or even less. Drones have an advantage over delivery trucks in that they can use a more direct route, rather than having to follow winding streets. That saves time. What do we know about Amazon's drones? Bezos has told us that the drones will be able to carry a five-pound payload for about 10 miles. It's not completely clear whether Bezos expects the drones to come back to the facility in half an hour or if he's only counting outbound travel time. But experts estimate that a 15-minute flight out, followed by a 15-minute flight back, would call for average speeds of 40 miles an hour. That's pretty zippy. Are current drones even capable of all that? That depends on what drone researchers call SWaP \u2014 size, weight and power. This is essentially a physics problem: The larger your payload, the more lift you need. The more lift you need, the larger your battery has to be, which further adds to the weight, which adds to the power requirements, and so on. After analyzing Amazon's promotional video, Christopher Vo \u2014 a robotics researcher at George Mason University \u2014 estimates that Amazon's \"octocopter\" drone probably uses a 10,000-mAh, 22-volt lithium ion polymer battery made up of six or 10 cells. These batteries are a lot like the ones that power a laptop, except that their chemistry allows for a much greater energy draw. You can find these easily on hobbyist Web sites. And, in fact, according to Vo, you can actually buy an octocopter resembling the one in Amazon's video for about $24,000. What about larger payloads? Five pounds doesn't sound like much. It's possible, but improbable, at least for now. Some private drones can carry more than a dozen pounds of weight. But in the \"60 Minutes\" interview Sunday, Bezos acknowledged that \"we're not going to deliver kayaks or table saws that way.\" Where we might actually see faster progress is in the way that companies ship things internally. Big 747s and other cargo planes can already fly on autopilot, for the most part. From there, it's not too far of a leap to convert them into fully autonomous aircraft. Bezos predicts the Amazon drones will take off in about five years. How realistic is that? It's optimistic but not unrealistic. A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration says that while current rules prohibit Amazon from rolling this out today, a three- to five-year target \"kind of lines up\" with an FAA process to relax those regulations. Last month, the agency released a roadmap charting out how those regulations will be rewritten. By next August, the FAA expects to have rules ready for consumer drones, followed by guidelines for commercial drones a few years later. Here's something else to think about: The United States may not actually be the best place to test this program out. Given how long it's taken for the FAA to loosen its policies on commercial drones, we might see Amazon turn to other countries first. Timothy Reuter, who heads a D.C.-based drone hobbyists' group, says Canada might be an attractive choice. \"It's not so far away, but they're much more permissive,\" says Reuter. Are these drones going to crash into my dogs and kids? The risk will probably be pretty low, at least at the outset. But that's only because the drones will likely be controlled by humans. What you're really asking about are fully autonomous drones. The big obstacle is, well, detecting obstacles. Human pilots instinctively know to avoid trees and buildings. Drones don't. For that, they need something called sense-and-avoid technology \u2014 which is pretty good at the moment, but not great enough that we can trust an entire machine to fly itself exclusively. Until then, Amazon will probably hire drone pilots to fly each individual drone. Then it might graduate to a system where one overseer is monitoring a handful of machines at once from a control center. Another way to solve the sense-and-avoid problem, says Vo, is to reduce the number of variables that the drone will have to contend with near the ground. You could do this by building some kind of helipad on people's rooftops so that the drone never has to interact with your doorstep. Maybe this will even become standard across most new homes so that other companies \u2014 FedEx, UPS, etc. \u2014 could take advantage of it, too. So, you're saying these things will be equipped with cameras? Yep. And that raises a whole range of privacy issues, says Reuter. \"From the video [Amazon] shot, they only showed this thing flying over wide open fields, not anyone's head,\" says Reuter. \"Obviously, the safety risk there was very low. The reality is, they'll be flying over many inhabited areas if this is going to be meaningful. Where this is going to make a lot of sense is in dense urban areas. But that's the hardest nut to crack from a safety and privacy perspective.\" (The drones will also presumably need to operate in inclement weather, not only in the clear, sunny skies shown in the corporate video.) Sounds creepy. I don't want to be watched by an Amazon drone. Wait here -- I'm getting my shotgun. Whoa, okay. That actually points to something else Amazon will have to think about \u2014 how to protect its unmanned vehicles. You're not the only person who's thought about shooting these things down; residents of one Colorado town have even considered giving out actual hunting permits for unmanned vehicles. There are all sorts of other ways you could tamper with airborne delivery devices. For years, the FAA has been battling troublemakers who shine lasers into the eyes of human pilots while they're at the controls. What if somebody tried to blind an Amazon drone? Then there's the question of how to secure the data link between Amazon's drones and the ground control station that monitors them. You don't want your delivery to get hacked and stolen, or worse \u2014 turned into a flying weapon. \"Currently most of the [ground control system] feeds in the consumer space are unencrypted,\" says George Mason's Vo. \"But even if they are encrypted, you can still deny service by radio jamming and other kinds of activities like that.\" Hang on. Didn't Amazon just announce a deal with the U.S. Postal Service? Won't these drones supersede them? That's a possibility. But remember, this future is still years away. Amazon's experiment with drone technology suggests it may be looking at drones as simply one part of a broader delivery system that integrates multiple technologies. There are other emerging new technologies, such as 3D printing and self-driving cars, that might help Amazon tighten up any lags in its supply chain and get items to consumers more quickly.",

        "content": " Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos showed CBS's Charlie Rose a prototype drone, termed an \"octocopter,\" designed for picking up packages at Amazon fulfillment centers and dropping them off at customer residences. That's a cool concept. But like the various beer and burrito delivering drones of the past, some experts say it's nothing more than a gimmick at this point due to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) process for approving civilian drones in the national airspace. Matt Waite, a professor at the University of Nebraska and founder of their Drone Journalism Lab, is skeptical of Bezos's plan, saying he \"does not really comprehend what the FAA says they might allow in 2015, and it also really underestimates how slow the FAA has been going with this.\" Waite has had his own run-ins with the FAA, who essentially shut down the Drone Journalism Lab's ability to fly outdoors. \"What the FAA has said is that in 2014 they are going to put out a notice of proposed rule-making; the intent behind that is to establish rules for small unmanned aerial systems.\" That means drones up to 55 pounds, Waite said. \"The rules will definitely cover Amazon Prime Air, but the FAA has already said in their road map there are going significant restrictions on where and when and how those things can fly.\" But perhaps more importantly for Amazon Prime Air, Waite said, are the parts of the road map which make clear that autonomous drones aren't in the cards any time soon. Bezos said Amazon Prime Air drones would be \"autonomous,\" using GPS coordinates to navigate. But according to Waite, the FAA road map says \"there will have to be a pilot in command of the device at all times, which pretty much blows Bezos's dream of autonomous drones carrying packages out of the water.\" Waite believes autonomous operations are \"way down the road,\" with a best guess of 2020 or 2024 \u2014 later than the timeline laid out by Bezos of as little as five years. Even others who are more optimistic about Bezos's plan note this is a significant hurdle. Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor, told my colleague Timothy B. Lee yesterday that he thinks Amazon Air is feasible, but \"it's likely that a person would have to be in the loop initially\" to pilot the devices. Autonomous operations raise a lot of safety questions for the FAA, especially in highly populated areas, Waite said: \"You're talking about eight spinning blades that you are now, by design, putting very near to people.\" Proposing flying those drones automatically through cities or above crowded public events is a safety hazard that the FAA is not going to take lightly, said Waite, adding that \"it's all fun and games until little Sally loses a finger.\" And because it needs to consider the long-term implications for national air space, he expects the FAA to be working on a much more extended time frame than Bezos realizes. To illustrate his point, he noted just how long it took for the agency to approve limited electronic devices on airplanes. But while Amazon was able to lobby effectively on that issue, Waite doesn't think they will have the same level of sway on drones \u2014 even after such a splashy move to get attention in the space. \"There are defense contractors and major agricultural companies that are jumping up and down and screaming on this stuff and the FAA is not moving,\" he said, adding, \"I just don't think in comparison to the defense industrial complex and big agriculture, Amazon is much of a player.\"",

        "name": "Supreme Court declines case on making online retailers collect sales taxes; The high court refuses to review a New York court\u2019s ruling to require collections even by out-of-state firms. ",
        "content": " On one of the busiest online-shopping days of the year, the Supreme Court declined Monday to get involved in state efforts to force Web retailers such as Amazon.com to collect sales tax from customers even in places where the companies do not have a physical presence. The multibillion-dollar issue \u2014 which could end tax-free online shopping for many Americans \u2014 is one of the most important in modern retailing. Traditional bricks-and-mortar businesses say the online retailers receive an unfair advantage by not having to collect sales taxes in some areas. All but five states impose sales taxes on purchases, whether online or not, and an increasing number have passed legislation to force online retailers such as Overstock.com and eBay to begin collecting those taxes from customers. The court's decision to stay out of the issue for now may put more pressure on Congress to come up with a national solution, as both online and traditional retailers complain about a patchwork of state laws and conflicting lower-court decisions. \"The failure of the court to take and decide this case will create an additional burden on interstate commerce since the line between a physical and virtual presence will only continue to blur,\" said David C. Blum, a Chicago tax lawyer who represents online retailers and traditional businesses. \"We can only hope that the court will take other similar cases in the near future\" to settle the issue. Customers in states with sales taxes are supposed to remit the tax on purchases they make from online retailers. But few do. The National Conference of State Legislatures estimated in 2012 that states lost $23 billion in uncollected taxes of all types and that about half were from online sales. As is its custom, the court gave no explanation for turning down petitions from Amazon and Overstock to review a decision by New York's highest court to uphold that state's 2008 law requiring sales tax collections. Seattle-based Amazon has no offices, distribution centers or workforce in New York. But the New York Court of Appeals said the company's relationship with third-party affiliates in the state that receive commissions for sending Web traffic its way satisfied the \"substantial nexus\" necessary to force the company to collect taxes. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.) Overstock Executive Vice President Jonathan Johnson said that he was disappointed by the court's action and that his company thinks it has \"no obligation to be the tax collector for the state of New York.\" Overstock suspended its relationship with affiliates in the state that would have made it subject to the New York law. State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman (D) had urged the court to stay out of the fight while elected officials continue to address it. \"Today's Supreme Court decision validates New York's efforts to treat both online and brick-and-mortar retailers equally and fairly, by requiring all retailers with a presence in our state to collect sales taxes,\" he said in a statement. It has been more than 20 years since the Supreme Court ruled in Quill v. North Dakota that a state's efforts to require tax collections from out-of-state companies violated the Constitution's commerce clause. It said the necessary \"substantial nexus\" exists when the out-of-state retailer has a \"physical presence\" in the state. But that decision came before a revolution in online shopping, and the New York court said the old test may be outdated. \"An entity may now have a profound impact upon a foreign jurisdiction solely through its virtual projection via the Internet,\" the court ruled. To underscore the judicial conflict over the issue, Illinois' top court last month struck down its state law, which was modeled after New York's, but for different legal reasons. A spokeswoman for the Illinois attorney general said no decision has been made about whether to appeal. The ability to make sales without collecting sales tax has benefited Amazon and other online retailers, and the company has been fighting the state efforts one at a time. But as Amazon has been building distribution centers nationwide to deliver goods more quickly, it has more often met the physical presence requirement. According to its Web site, Amazon now collects sales taxes in 16 states, including Virginia and the country's two most populous: California and Texas. The Supreme Court's Quill decision said Congress was in a better position than the court to provide uniformity in state tax collection requirements, but little progress has been made. The federal government does not impose sales taxes. As Amazon has been collecting the tax in more states, the company has split with other online retailers to advocate for a uniform federal law. The Senate in the spring passed the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013, which would require companies that exceed $1 million in Internet sales outside the states where they are located to collect every state's sales tax. But the future of the bill is uncertain in the House. Some House Republicans said agreeing with the Senate bill would result in tax increases for constituents. In response to Monday's development, Amazon said in a statement: \"The Supreme Court already has addressed the sales tax issue, saying in Quill that Congress can and should act to resolve it. The Marketplace Fairness Act now pending before Congress would protect states' rights to make their own revenue policy choices while allowing them to collect more than a fraction of the revenue that's already owed.\" robert.barnes@washpost.com",

        "content": " Jeffrey P. Bezos has never been known for thinking small. And in an interview aired Sunday on CBS's \"60 Minutes,\" he outlined his latest plan for revolutionizing the retail industry: using drones to deliver packages in as little as 30 minutes. Declaring himself an \"optimist,\" the Amazon.com founder and chief executive predicted the technology could be brought to market in as little as five years. This is more than a theoretical idea.

In his \"60 Minutes\" interview, Bezos said that the prototype octocopter has redundant motors so it can stay in the air even if one fails. Calo said the FAA may be skittish about allowing fully automated drones in the sky. At least initially, the agency might require that a human guide the drones remotely during deliveries. That might initially drive up the cost of the service, limiting its use to customers willing to pay a premium. Technological issues also could limit the technology's value in the next few years. According to Calo, the current generation of autonomous flying machines can carry only a few pounds and stay in the air for about 15 minutes. That means that it probably wouldn't be possible to serve an entire metropolitan area from a single fulfillment center. But Amazon may be able to overcome both obstacles in the long run. That means that someday, unmanned flights that could allow 30-minute deliveries to become as common and affordable as two-day delivery are today.",

Answers to these questions and more are below. You may have heard that unmanned drones will eventually be making your Amazon deliveries. The idea seems so crazy, it's bound to raise a few questions. Is it really possible? What kind of obstacles will Amazon chief executive (and Washington Post owner) Jeffrey Bezos have to overcome? And how will his plan shape the future of drone technology? Answers to these and more are below. In as soon as five years, Amazon says, it's going to field a fleet of drones that will deliver anything you order - as long as it's less than five pounds - in minutes. Conveniently, Amazon has giant distribution centers scattered across the country. Most of the company's deliveries start out from these facilities; the drones would cut out the truck drivers who deliver your packages today. Traditional retailers compete on the strength of their products. But Amazon increasingly is competing on the basis of time - fulfilling our wishes as close to instantaneously as possible. The drone strategy promises to cut what's now a one- or two-day shipping window down to 30 minutes or less. Drones have an advantage over delivery trucks in that they can use a more direct route, rather than having to follow winding streets. That saves time. Bezos has said that the drones will be able to carry a five-pound payload for about 10 miles. A 15-minute flight out, followed by a 15-minute flight back, would call for average speeds of 40 mph. That's pretty zippy. This is essentially a physics problem: The larger your payload, the more lift you need. The more lift you need, the larger your battery has to be, which further adds to the weight, which adds to the power requirements, and so on. After analyzing Amazon's promotional video, Christopher Vo - a robotics researcher at George Mason University - estimates that Amazon's \"octocopter\" drone probably uses a 10,000-mAh, 22-volt lithium ion polymer battery made up of six or 10 cells. These batteries are a lot like the ones that power a laptop, except that their chemistry allows for a much greater energy draw. You can find these on hobbyist Web sites. In fact, according to Vo, you can buy an octocopter resembling the one in Amazon's video for about $24,000. It's possible, but improbable, at least for now. Some private drones can carry more than 12 pounds.

It reported better-than-expected quarterly results last month with sales at department stores open at least a year up an impressive 3.5 percent. Macy's came through with a profit of 47 cents a share, blowing away the profit of 39 cents a share that analysts were forecasting. This is just the kind of momentum that investors like to see heading into the telltale holiday shopping season. The leading online retailer has been taking advantage of its low overhead and efficient fulfillment to deliver all-weather growth over the years. [Founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns Capital Business and The Washington Post.] Things shouldn't be any different this time around as Wall Street's counting on sales to soar 22 percent during the holiday quarter with profitability more than tripling for the period. Amazon's brazen entry into consumer electronics a few years ago now finds it the leading maker of e-readers and a fast-growing player in entry-level tablets. Amazon's low prices should continue to serve it well in an economy that's showing signs of life with more shoppers armed with smartphones to compare prices before they buy something in the real world. The Mac maker ended its 2013 fiscal year on Sept. 30 in mixed fashion. Revenue improved 4 percent while earnings per share actually fell 5 percent. Call it the law of large numbers at work: Apple sold $171 billion worth of product in fiscal 2013 and hosted some 400 million customers at its stores. Will above-average growth return in first quarter? The new iPad Air and long-awaited iPad Mini with Retina Display are cause for hope, even if analysts predict meager holiday sales. Don't place too much faith in their skepticism: Apple destroyed estimates in last year's first quarter. What had been a nice 2013 rally turned south recently when Best Buy admitted that sustained price cuts needed to take on Amazon could take a toll on results in future quarters. A fresh round of exclusive products, such as Samsung's Blue Arctic Galaxy S4 smartphone, could help spur growth during the dip. For now, though, the blue crew's results are all green: $9.36 billion in third-quarter revenue and 18 cents a share in earnings, easily besting Wall Street's 12-cent a share target. Same-store sales rose 0.3 percent internationally and 1.7 percent at U.S. locations. WP20131202motley1202",

        "name": "Will same-day delivery shake up the holiday shopping season?; Analysts say the nascent offering isn\u2019t likely to have a major influence this year. ",
        "content": " With same-day delivery services, Internet retailers such as Wal-Mart, eBay and Amazon.com are experimenting with ways to give online shoppers something close to instant gratification. For $5, eBay Now allows customers to get local goods delivered in \"about an hour.\" Wal-Mart, which is testing its same-day service in Northern Virginia and other areas, delivers items for up to $10 per purchase. And Amazon's same-day deliveries cost as little as $3.99 per shipment. Although such services could upend the way consumers shop in the long term, analysts say that the nascent offerings are unlikely to make a dent in holiday shopping patterns this year. \"People just don't really understand what it is and why they need it yet,\" said Matt Nemer, a senior retail analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. According to the National Retail Federation, only 4.2 percent of consumers used same-day delivery frequently during last year's holiday shopping crush, and only 7.2 percent used the service once or twice. Analysts said that consumer psyche is part of the reason: Most have decided they don't need their items right away. \"Same-day delivery is sort of more of a novelty item rather than a structural thing that's going to make people buy more,\" said Adrienne Tennant, a retail analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. The growth of same-day delivery also depends on the size of the potential customer base. And the services are available only in a few densely populated urban areas. Amazon, for example, offers same-day delivery in 11 metropolitan areas, while eBay Now is offered only in San Francisco, New York and Chicago. \"We haven't hit enough cities with it and enough areas with it,\" said Gene Alvarez, vice president and retail analyst at Gartner. Although Web-only retailers have been early innovators of same-day delivery offerings, analysts said that retailers with many brick-and-mortar stores and large inventories may benefit most from this model. \"Unless you're a large brick-and-mortar retailer with a lot of locations, it's tough to offer that and still make a good margin off that,\" said Sean Whitehouse, a partner in the retail practice at consulting firm Kurt Salmon. Although a relatively small share of shoppers are expected to use same-day delivery this holiday season, analysts say it will eventually gain traction as retailers expand and improve the experiences of those who use the service. Also, millennials are more likely than other shoppers to use same-day delivery, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2012, 12.4 percent of consumers ages 18 to 34 used the service, and an additional 17 percent used it occasionally, compared with 4.2 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, of all shoppers. Since this generation is just beginning to exercise its purchasing power, their interest in same-day delivery also suggests that demand could grow for the service over time, the trade group said. Men are more likely than women to be regular users of same-day delivery during the holiday season, with 6.3 percent of men and 2.4 percent of women using the service last year, the trade group said. The National Retail Federation forecasts that holiday sales will rise 3.9 percent, to $602.1 billion, up from last year's growth of 3.5 percent. Online sales, however, could increase as much as 15 percent, to $82 billion, according to the trade group. sarah.halzack@washpost.com",

        "content": " Published every weekday, the Switchboard highlights five tech policy stories you need to read. Amazon bares its computers. Quentin Hardy at the New York Time's Bits blog covers recent remarks from James Hamilton, vice president and distinguished engineer at Amazon Web Services, about the company's cloud-computing efforts. Amazon's cloud storage system reportedly \"handles 1.5 million requests a second, and holds trillions of 'objects,' or individual stored items\" and is \"building its own specialized computers, data storage systems, networking systems, even power substations and optical transmissions systems.\" Here's why Airbnb isn't worried about New York's crackdown. Our own Brian Fung interviewed Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk, who says Airbnb facilitates some 150,000 sleeping arrangements per night. They spoke about new features, the data they collect, and current legal issues in New York City, where the attorney general is concerned that some landlords are abusing the service and renting their properties illegally. Everyone agrees this cell phone rule is dumb. So why haven't we done anything about it? Fung again takes on why Congress hasn't fixed cell phone unlocking, the rule by which it is illegal to switch your cell phone carrier while using the same device. \"Last year, the Library of Congress decided not to renew an exemption for cellphone-unlocking under the nation's copyright laws, overturning a six-year history of approving the practice and creating today's impasse in the process,\" Fung explains. But now there's been no progress to change the rule. \"What makes the situation even less comprehensible is how much everyone seems to agree this is a stupid rule,\" writes Fung. \"The White House thinks so. Congress thinks so. And now, the nation's top telecom regulator thinks so, too.\" Snap out of it: Kids aren't reliable tech predictors. Farhad Manjoo at the Wall Street Journal is skeptical of Snapchat -- at least partially because he does not think the current clientele are the best predictors of tech success. \"I believe the children aren't our future. Teach them well, but when it comes to determining the next big thing in tech, let's not fall victim to the ridiculous idea that they lead the way.\" Many major innovations haven't done well with teens initially due to price barriers, he said. In addition, the teen years are often plagued by fads. \"Is the app just a youthful fad, just another boy band, or is it something more permanent; is it the Beatles?\" Still on Facebook, but Finding Less to Like. Speaking of social media, Jenna Wortham at The New York Times asks a question a lot us keep thinking about: \"is it just me, or is Facebook fading?\" Describing her own behavior, Wortham says, \"my formerly hyperactive Facebook life has slowed to a crawl. I've found that most of my younger relatives have graduated from high school and have deleted their accounts or whittled them down until there is barely any personal information left. As for my own account, I rarely add photographs or post updates about what I've been doing.\"",

        "name": "'Alpha House':A familiar castof caricatures ",
        "content": " Garry Trudeau's \"Alpha House,\" a half-hour comedy series that's now streaming for your fickle platform pleasure on Amazon.com, is about four Republican senators who are roommates in a Capitol Hill townhouse. Everything about \"Alpha House\" looks good to go at first. It has the right cast, led by John Goodman; it has a studied understanding that modern comedy must put abject humiliation and awkwardness above all other forms of humor; it is written so that characters speak in smart spurts of cutting hatefulness; it easily accommodates a series of boldface names who make cameo appearances as either characters or as themselves; and most of all, it has at its helm Trudeau, the \"Doonesbury\" creator who can lay claim to a formative work of TV political comedy (HBO's ancient \"Tanner '88,\" a collaboration with Robert Altman). Strangely, the one element \"Alpha House\" is missing is hilarity. As in LOL, as in the kind of laughter you can hear coming from the person in the other room who is watching the show on his iPa - excuse me, his Kindle Fire. (Obligatorily, I must note here that The Washington Post is now owned by the guy who founded Amazon. But you know that.) The show is so tight - maybe too tight - that it starts to choke on its own power-tie premise in the first three episodes. Part of \"Alpha House's\" burden to bear is that it feels about 15 crucial minutes late to the raging bonfire that is now Washington parody. This territory is already well-scorched - lately by HBO's cruelly unerring \"Veep,\" but also by Netflix's stylish and utterly cynical \"House of Cards\" (meant to be a drama, yet easily ingested as satire, like ABC's \"Scandal\"), as well as the familiar, nightly whippings that Beltway and media culture receive from Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. A more pressing challenge (perhaps also a boon) to launching yet another show about Washington's absurd ineptitude is that you have to compete with actual headlines, including but not limited to debt ceilings, shutdowns, partisan gridlock and, of course, federal Web site rollouts. There's never been a better time to strike, except for the long line of people already doing it. The mockery of This Town - as portrayed in the best-selling book \"This Town\" - can easily get as old as the subject being mocked. Colbert, whose show factors into one of \"Alpha House's\" establishing plots, is kind of a spirit guide for \"Alpha House,\" which, like \"The Colbert Report,\" sends up Republican politics with characters who are themselves unwaveringly Republican. Thus we enter a somewhat nuanced and sarcastic exploration of greed, piggishness and double standards on social and sexual mores - all of it played for laughs rather than outrage. Goodman is North Carolina Sen. Gil John Biggs, a profane politician coasting mainly on his former glory as a basketball coach, which has guaranteed him a long life in Washington - or so he thinks. His roomies include the townhouse's fussy owner, Sen. Louis Laffer of Nevada (Matt Malloy), a married Mormon struggling to maintain appearances (the viewer is to understand that he's a closet case hiding his homosexuality). Laffer's reelection has turned into an uphill battle now that he's facing a primary race against a macho, gun-toting rival; Biggs, too, is facing a serious challenger and must reluctantly rediscover his dwindling charm reserves. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania Sen. Robert Bettencourt (played by \"The Wire's\" Clark Johnson) swaggers along a fine line: He's a powerful black Republican whose gift for graft has him going before grand juries and the Senate's ethics committee. Lastly, the senators are joined by a new housemate who can outshine and out-slime them all: the freshly divorced, skirt-chasing Florida Sen. Andy Guzman (Mark Consuelos), whose invincible sense of entitlement has him eyeing the White House. Through these four men, Trudeau and company have landed on a set of updated, if nevertheless derisively stereotypical, portrayals of GOP hubris - as when the four senators make a publicity trip to Afghanistan and are compelled (through PAC contributors) to entrust their safety to a private-sector paramilitary escort instead of the U.S. military. The most interesting (and pathetic) character is Malloy's Sen. Laffer, who can't catch a break: A self-effacing trip to \"The Colbert Report\" suddenly devolves when the TV host challenges Laffer to a wrestling match; he winds up with a face full of Colbert's crotch. Like Julia Louis-Dreyfus's vice president on \"Veep,\" the men of \"Alpha House\" each struggle to keep ahead of the Twittersphere's light-speed effect on political currency; Goodman says that something has \"gone virile\" online; Laffer has to call a staffer to ask what a \"meme\" is. It's all a little bit funny, but, again, it's not the sort of funny in which you repeat the best lines to your friends. The way the \"Alpha House\" men go about business on the Hill could be interpreted as flattery to the Republicans (especially in the Goodman character's unabashed confidence in his conservative views), perhaps as much as it can be seen as the insult the show ultimately intends to be. After all, Trudeau and company are promoting the party's fondest big-tent desires: Here's a black guy, a gay-ish guy, a Latino guy, a fat Southern guy - it's all the elephants in one room, sharing rent. In this age of constantly morphing rules about publicity and shame, the Republicans should know exactly how to treat \"Alpha House\": as a Valentine.

        "name": "Amazon\u2019s Sunday plan further crumbles the wall between week and weekend; Amazon\u2019s plan to deliver on Sundays further crumbles the wall between workweek and weekend. ",
        "content": " Already, work e-mails and conference calls have become part of Sunday routines, piling on top of sports tournaments, errands and homework. Now, with Amazon.com's plans to deliver packages on Sundays, one more barrier falls, inching that day even closer to becoming just another part of the consumer week. The tradition of a seventh day set aside for family and rest has been crumbling for years as states relaxed laws prohibiting gambling, shopping and even hunting on Sundays. The popularity of smartphones and the creation of an always-online culture has spurred greater demand \u2014 and ability \u2014 to have it all, right now, anytime. \"We are moving toward a society where e-mail and social media have caused the week and weekend to blur,\" said Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics and labor at MIT. \"Blue laws\" that ban Sunday activities \u2014 dating to the 1600s \u2014 have been gradually repealed in many states, but some remain. In Maryland, car sales on Sundays are widely banned, though they are allowed in Montgomery, Prince George's and Howard counties. Sunday hunting is banned in many states. In Virginia, the rules are more specific: Hunting with firearms or other weapons is banned on Sundays, though raccoons may be hunted until 2 a.m. As cities and states look for more revenue, they have loosened laws banning liquor sales on Sundays. The D.C. Council approved a plan to allow them late last year, and liquor stores in Montgomery County were allowed to sell on Sundays starting in 2010. A new law that took effect last year in Virginia allowed state-run stores in small communities to start selling alcohol on Sundays Amazon's national plan to partner with the U.S. Postal Service could open the door to a wave of Sunday deliveries by other companies. The money-losing Postal Service, which recently was trying to persuade Congress to halt Saturday mail, said it will expand Sunday staffing and hopes to sign up more clients. The agency declined to disclose specifics or to reveal how much new revenue it expects. There were no complaints about prolonging the workweek from a union representing letter carriers. \"We're excited about the potential of the rapidly growing e-commerce market and what it means for the Postal Service,\" said Fredric Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers. Expanding Sunday service \"would benefit the economy, consumers, businesses and the nation as a whole,\" he said. Amazon said its plan originated from consumer demands to get their online orders faster. \"We hope it crosses an errand or two off the weekend to-do list,\" Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Competitors such as Wal-Mart, eBay and Google are racing to satisfy consumers virtually around the clock, aiming to deliver products just hours after someone places an online order. \"Amazon's announcement is another incremental development in the erosion of that restful space \u2014 Sunday \u2014 and another example of an erosion on the limits of market activity,\" said Jordan J. Ballor, a research fellow at the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, an economic think tank. The changes of shopping patterns began well before online commerce took off. Wal-Mart, Kmart and other major retailers were criticized when they started opening their stores on Sundays years ago. Since then, they have expanded shopping hours to 24 hours a day and holidays. They have faced renewed backlash over plans to open on Thanksgiving Day. Last year, an employee of Target wrote a letter to company chief executive Gregg W. Steinhafel, asking him to close the chain of stores on Thanksgiving. The letter was posted as a petition on Change.org and got more than 300,000 signatures of support. The company stood by its decision to open on Thanksgiving evening, saying it was responding to the interests of shoppers and of employees who asked to work the overtime shifts. In an age of constant commerce, consumers have struggled to reconcile their urge to spend with older traditions of quiet Sundays. Last month, some residents of Bergen County, N.J., tried to repeal a county ban on the sale of furniture, clothing and electronics on Sundays. They had argued that opening retail stores seven days a week would boost the local economy. But they failed to get enough signatures of support. A few companies have resisted the seven-day trend. Chick-fil-A's 1,700 fast-food restaurants and Hobby Lobby's 560 craft stores are closed on Sundays. Chick-fil-A's founder believes that \"all franchised Chick-fil-A operators and their restaurant employees should have an opportunity to rest, spend time with family and friends, and worship if they choose to do so,\" according to a statement on the company's Web site. But such cases are rare. The combination of weaker labor unions, fewer blue laws and greater consumer demand has made it easier for companies to get away with e-mails during off-hours and stores open at all hours, said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \"This, combined with technology, has made the week endless,\" he said.  cecilia.kang@washpost.com",

        "name": "At this point, Amazon might as well just buy the Postal Service ",
        "content": " The news out this morning that Amazon.com had essentially hired the U.S. Postal Service to deliver on Sundays was both surprising and completely sensible. The partnership of a floundering, old-world institution and perhaps the nation's most future-oriented tech company \u2014 Amazon's strategy is to take losses today in the service of profits down the road \u2014 would at first seem incongruous. As my colleague Brian Fung outlined, though, teaming up for Sunday delivery gives both of them an edge over the competition that could force the rest of the industry to adapt. And why stop there? Amazon and the USPS have lots more to gain from each other \u2014 so much so that an outright merger might maximize the best qualities of both. Let's start with the situation of the USPS. The Postal Service has known for a while now that the economics of the shipping industry were changing such that it would have to make dramatic changes to stay afloat. A Boston Consulting Group study in 2009 mapped declining mail volumes out through the year 2020, when it calculated that the USPS would lose $15 billion in a single year \u2014 especially since revenue per delivery point would fall by 30 percent, as profitable first class-items disappear. And yet, the Postal Service has been bettering itself. Even as overall revenue falls, it's been serving more delivery points and increasing income from \"negotiated service agreements\" with private companies. It's proven itself to be a decent innovator, keeping up with technology to move mail more efficiently. It has shed more than 200,000 employees over the past 10 years and is in a position to lose more, as about half are eligible for retirement. That should make it easier to bring down labor costs, which now make up some 80 percent of the USPS' budget, compared to UPS and FedEx's respective 61 percent and 43 percent. The biggest problems for the Postal Service today are the overhang of pension and retiree health benefit obligations, which totaled $96 billion at the end of 2012, and endless congressional wrangling over how it should operate. Although it's managed to reduce 21,000 routes and consolidate some mail processing facilities, pleas to close unprofitable post offices and cut Saturday delivery always run into a wall of \"no,\" and substantial changes to the business model \u2014 like the ability to offer \"non-postal\" services \u2014 are subject to legislative approval. That's led to a consistent drumbeat of calls for the USPS' privatization, which has been happening gradually for decades anyway, and which most of Europe has already accomplished. The question is just how to pull it off. Now, let's turn to Amazon. The company has been investing heavily in ways to deliver more products faster, cheaper, and farther than the competition, including dozens of warehouses in the U.S., a fleet of trucks, and even \"lockers\" for people to pick up their goods at local convenience stores. It's expensive: Fulfillment costs amounted to $1.96 billion, or 11.5 percent of revenue, last quarter alone. Amazon considers it an investment in the future, as part of its strategy to provide anything customers might need as fast as they could possibly get it (as well as a tax strategy, since it knows it'll lose the benefits of lacking a physical presence in states soon anyway). The embodiment of this gambit is AmazonFresh, which doesn't yet make a profit, but is supposed to ease the transition towards delivering more and more goods. Owning the Postal Service would get Amazon the rest of the way there. It's got 31,000 post offices and 461 mail processing centers, which represent significant excess capacity. The USPS is still the best last-mile mail delivery service provider, and Amazon is perhaps the most aggressive warehousing logistics innovator, which could enable a partnership \u2014 similar to one proposed by a group of former postal leaders and partly approved by the National Academy of Public Administration \u2014 that would leverage the strengths of both. Of course, there are important questions to ask about the public role of the USPS in delivering the mail to everyone, wherever they might be, even if doing so costs more than it's able to charge. But there are other examples of former government monopolies that have gone private on the condition that they maintain a degree of universal service, like the phone system (the benefits of the resulting telecom duopoly are debatable, but it's probably better than still having Ma Bell). Another concern: Wouldn't it be problematic to hand a monopoly to a private company? Well, the new Amazon Postal Service could also be required to offer its services to other companies at competitive rates, as it already does with its rapidly expanding network of data centers. Meanwhile, competition is already shaping up: EBay has partnered with FedEx, and it's not hard to imagine Wal-Mart doing the same with UPS. Sure, there are still a lot of details to be worked out; the Postal Service isn't Amazon's typical rinky dink acquisition, and the financials could be challenging even for CEO Jeff Bezos's ever-permissive investors. But with no obvious fix in sight, it's worth keeping all options on the table.",

        "content": " For most people, waiting at home for a package to be delivered is largely infeasible during the workweek, leaving Saturday as their best hope for catching the parcel truck. But thanks to Amazon, consumers can now get their e-commerce shipments on Sundays, too. The shift is great news for online shoppers. It's likely to be even better for the U.S. Postal Service, the unlikely agency responsible for those weekend deliveries. In case you haven't heard, the Postal Service is in trouble. The service's losses have already amounted to $3.9 billion this year, thanks in part to a legal requirement that it funnel vast amounts of money into a health pension program for its workers every year. Another problem? People are sending less mail. By the end of the decade, according to a federal study, mail volumes will be about where they were in the 1980s. Amazon could have offered to pay the Postal Service for carrying more of its packages generally, and USPS would have gotten a much-needed injection of cash. That's not what the deal is about, though. What makes the Amazon agreement so marvelous is the way it turns the symbol of a bygone era into an actual agent of disruption. By launching Sunday deliveries, the Postal Service has moved to where its longtime competitors aren't. Hardly anybody in any industry delivers on Sunday, with the exception of newspapers. As a business idea, this makes total sense \u2014 and while USPS doesn't exactly threaten FedEx or UPS, it might cause those companies to strike agreements with other e-commerce businesses. The deal will effectively shake up the shipping industry. The other reason it's disruptive? This is one of the few cases we've seen of what we'll call reverse contracting \u2014 when the private sector hires a government agency to fill its need rather than the other way around. We haven't seen much of this, in part because there are so few publicly run, consumer-facing services like USPS at the federal level. There's Amtrak, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and a handful of others. But the pact between Amazon and USPS might open the door to further reverse contracting. If this venture takes off, Amazon may unintentionally wind up pioneering a new model for public-private partnerships. The deal with Amazon won't single-handedly save USPS. And at this point, officials from both parties are keeping quiet about the terms of the agreement. But it puts the Postal Service in an aggressive posture that's as refreshing as it is surprising.",

Amazon announced Monday that it will begin Sunday deliveries using the government agency's fleet of foot soldiers, office workers and truck drivers to bring packages to homes seven days a week. To accommodate the online retailing giant, the Postal Service said it will for the first time deliver packages at regular rates on Sundays. Previously, a shipper had to use its pricey Express Mail service and pay an extra fee for Sunday delivery. The initiative will begin immediately in Los Angeles and New York and spread to the Washington area and much of the rest of the nation next year, Postal Service officials said. The partnership should help the turnaround effort underway at the financially strapped Postal Service, they said. The USPS has seen its volume of letters drop by half in the past decade as Americans increasingly pay bills online and use Web chat, texting and social media to stay in touch. The Postal Service is asking Congress for the authority to let it drop Saturday delivery of letters but keep weekend shipment of packages so it can continue to exploit the growth of online commerce. \"As online shopping continues to increase, the Postal Service is very happy to offer shippers like Amazon the option of having packages delivered on Sunday,\" Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe said in a statement. The arrangement with Amazon could open the doors to more partnerships with retailers that are eager to use the 500,000 USPS employees and 31,000 post offices across the country to satisfy consumers who want to get what they buy online faster. The Postal Service said it would increase staffing in the locations where Amazon will offer the service, but did not offer specific numbers. The USPS also declined to comment on how much additional revenue the new initiative is expected to bring. In 2012, the number of packages the agency delivered rose to 3.5 billion, from 3.3 billion in 2011 and 3.1 billion in 2010. Even so, the Postal Service lost $21 billion over the past two years \u2014 and predicts it will continue to operate deep in the red \u2014 largely because of the growing expense of delivering letters. For Amazon, the partnership steps up a fierce battle to make online shopping closer to the instant-buying experience at bricks-and-mortar stores. In the near future, e-commerce is expected to deliver a variety of items \u2014 designer jeans or a jug of milk \u2014 within hours after an online order is placed. Wal-Mart, Google, eBay and others are experimenting with same-day delivery. Amazon has apilot project called Amazon Fresh, which offers grocery delivery in Los Angeles and Seattle, and plans to expand it nationwide. With an eye on these efforts, the Postal Service began experimenting with same-day delivery in San Francisco. For years, Amazon has wanted to deliver packages seven days a week but was stymied by the cost of getting packages from its distribution centers to doorsteps. United Parcel Service, FedEx and the USPS charges consumers and businesses more to deliver on Sundays. In the new deal with Amazon, the Postal Service will not charge Amazon or its customers extra for Sunday shipments. \"This is part of a continuing effort to make online shopping anormal, seven-day-a-week,any-time-you-want experience,\" said Dave Clark, Amazon's vice president of worldwide operations and customer service. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Analysts say Amazon has been willing to bear financial losses to expand its business. It sells its Kindle tablets at break-even prices or at a loss in the hopes that consumers will buy more books and other goods through the e-reader. It eats shipping costs for subscribers of its Prime membership service to get them to buy more. The firm wouldn't specify when the Sunday deliveries will be available for the Washington area, Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, Phoenix and other major metropolitan areas next year. Sunday service won't be available in Hawaii and Alaska, the USPS said. The Postal Service said it will use its part-time employees, known as city carrier assistants and rural carrier associates, for the Sunday operations. If the volume of packages is projected to be large for a certain Sunday, the agency said it will increase its staffing. The agency doesn't need approval by Congress to expand its package delivery schedule to seven days. \"People want instant gratification,\" said Sue Brennan, a spokeswoman for the USPS. \"And letter writing, as wonderful as it is, and as good as a letter smells and feels, is a lost art. People aren't doing it any more.\" cecilia.kang@washpost.com",

        "name": "Amazon to bookstores: Help us make you irrelevant ",
        "content": " Amazon on Wednesday announced a new program, Amazon Source, aimed at persuading small retailers to sell Kindle e-readers and tablets in stores. The Bookseller Program is specifically targeted at independent bookstores -- and appears to provide just enough rope for booksellers to hang themselves with. Amazon will sell the Kindles to the retailers at a modest 6 percent discount from the current MSRP and accessories at a 35 percent discount. The booksellers will then get their profit on the devices and add-ons, plus a 10 percent commission on the price of e-books purchased via their customers' Kindle devices for the next two years. But the problem here is that if customers switch their primary literary consumption to e-books, they aren't as likely to buy as many physical books. And at the end of those two years when they earn a commission on a customer's Kindle purchases, the bookstores will probably still be out of a significant chunk of that consumer's business. Print books aren't as dead as they might seem. In fact, the most recent annual numbers show a mere 1 percent drop in physical book sales over the previous years. Plus, as my colleague Neil Irwin pointed out, there's a segment of consumers who read a handful of books per year and like to keep them on a shelf as trophies. And some segments, like visual children's books, currently don't translate as well to digital formats. Still, bookstores are having a tough time. Bookstore sales fell 9.6 percent between 2007 and 2011. And bookstore sales from January through September of this year were down 2.6 percent from the same period last year. Consumers haven't stopped purchasing print books, but they are becoming increasingly likely to purchase through an e-tailer. You know, like Amazon. This trend is analogous to the shift in the video market from physical media to streaming content. Or, for that matter, the shift from print newspapers to the Web. And it could be argued that Amazon is offering independent retailers a way to get a cut of those sales as they look for another business model -- like, say, turning into a coffee shop. But it's hard not to see the Amazon Source program as Amazon asking booksellers to help make themselves irrelevant.",

The new Kindle First program will offer four e-books a month before their official print publication. Customers can purchase one of these Amazon-branded titles for $1.99. And Prime members can choose one of the books for free. Amazon Publishing publicist Katie Finch said via e-mail, \"Each Kindle First pick will feature an Editor's Note sharing why it was selected, including how the book first came to the editor's attention.\" The first books offered in the Kindle First program are: \"Things We Set on Fire,\" a novel about a mother and her daughters, by Deborah Reed. \"No Place for a Dame,\" a romance novel by Connie Brockway. \"Silent Echo,\" a thriller by J.R. Rain. \"We Will Survive,\" a collection of inspiring true-life stories by Grammy Award-winner Gloria Gaynor. The three novelists have written bestsellers before. Rain found success as a self-published author of the \"Vampire for Hire\" series. Gaynor published a memoir called \"I Will Survive\" in 1997. Customers will be able to purchase paper versions of these books in December for prices ranging from $8.34 to $10.95. (The undiscounted retail prices will be higher.) In today's announcement, Vice President of Kindle Content Russ Grandinetti said that the new Kindle First program will allow these Amazon-published books \"a chance to reach a much wider audience.\" When asked whether other publishers will eventually be able to offer books through this new program, Finch said, \"We'll have to ask you to stay tuned.\"",

        "content": " Today, the Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation of an office supply super-merger: the combination of Office Depot and OfficeMax, which you'd be forgiven for thinking were the same store anyway. They'd been talking about it since early this year, and the FTC worried that the combination of two of the industry's biggest players might post a threat to competition. So they ran the numbers. There's some precedent for antitrust enforcement in this area. Back in 1997, the FTC denied a proposed merger between Staples and Office Depot, figuring the resulting giant would have too much control over the market. Now, the OfficeMax-Office Depot tie-up would create the biggest entity in that traditional space, with some $17.5 billion in combined annual sales. But guess what's happened between 1997 and now? That's right \u2014 the Internet. Lots of companies and individuals just order their highlighters and paper clips from Amazon.com these days, or pick them up from Walmart or Target, putting Staples, OfficeMax and Office Depot under intense pressure. In that kind of environment, no amount of consolidation in the office supply space could threaten prices, since the external competition is so fierce. That's probably true of lots of industries, and signifies a shift in the antitrust landscape: When you have a couple super-retailers that sell everything anywhere as close to immediately as possible, other suppliers can basically get as big as they have to to survive. \"Until this was announced, everyone was like 'oh no, has the internet competition changed the competitive analysis enough to get antitrust approval?'\" said Matt Reilly of Simpson Thatcher, who argued the case for Office Depot. \"This was a significant change.\" Ironically, for some of those kinds of companies, it's too late: Borders and Barnes & Noble, for example, or Circuit City and Best Buy. They used to be the ones driving mom and pops out of business. Now they've come up against something even bigger.",

        "name": "Amazon ran the technical analysis of whether we have to shut down Kindles on planes ",
        "content": " Amazon had a lot of happy news to report in its earnings release last Thursday -- enough revenue to keep investors happy, even though the company kept losing money. CEO Jeff Bezos was characteristically giddy, ticking off his achievements, including one in Washington D.C.: A Federal Aviation Administration-commissioned panel finally recommended that airline passengers be allowed to use portable electronic devices (i.e., Kindles) on the plane, opening the door to a reversal of a ban against those devices within months. In the release, Bezos included \"a big hat tip to Nick Bilton on that one.\" Nick Bilton is the New York Times technology writer who was upset when interrupted in his Kindle reading as a plane taxied for takeoff, and then got the Times to pay for an independent test of whether the rays put out by a Kindle could actually disrupt a plane's communications systems. The answer was no -- which, sure, might have helped embarrass the FAA into giving its abundance of caution a rest. Bilton certainly took a victory lap when the panel's recommendation came out. But you know who Bezos probably should've thanked? Paul Misener, Amazon's head of global public policy, who chaired the technical subcommittee on the panel that pushed for the change (its report still hasn't come out). Misener has also lobbied the Federal Communications Commission, which has some jurisdiction over the issue, on \"issues related to accessibility\" for the past few years (the company would not confirm whether or not those issues related to the airplane question). Amazon even packed a plane full of Kindles, switched on, to make a point. Sure, it's true that plenty of other companies and organizations that supported and would benefit from consumers being able to use gadgets during taxiing and landing. But it's still eyebrow-raising that a company with the most commercial interest in the outcome of a panel's report would directly oversee the scientific content of that report, as opposed to, say, some independent technical expert, or even someone on the FAA's staff who might know about such things (like the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, which is stocked with academics). Because if a company puts out research supporting its business interests, it's usually taken with a heaping spoonful of salt. At the FAA, though, it's standard operating procedure. The agency convenes panels frequently, and often relies on people who make the equipment to test things and issue recommendations -- which just creates the opportunity for manipulation, even if it's never exercised. So if you're a stickler for scientific ethics, just look the other way. Here's what the agency had to say: The FAA sought public comment on expanded use of portable electronic devices on airplanes and announced publicly that the Agency was forming an advisory rulemaking committee. We selected participants based on experience and knowledge on the issue with the goal of having representation from stakeholders across the industry. The final report came from a group of experts that included representatives from the airlines, aviation manufacturers, passengers, pilots, flight attendants, and the mobile technology industry. The agency regularly works with government and industry experts to gather information to help the FAA make decisions on key technical issues.",

        "content": " Amazon.com posted a narrower quarterly loss and better-than-expected sales Thursday as the company expanded aggressively in the United States and made inroads into overseas markets, sending its shares up more than 8 percent in after-hours trading. The sales results underscored Amazon's strong momentum as the company - the world's largest Internet retailer - prepares for the crucial U.S. holiday season, which some experts say could be the slowest in years. Rival eBay gave a disappointing holiday forecast last week, saying the U.S. economy, including consumer confidence, had deteriorated in part because of the government shutdown. Amazon forecast sales of $23.5 billion to $26.5 billion for the holiday quarter, which analysts called conservative. \"It'll be a somewhat difficult macro environment in the fourth quarter,\" said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. \"But it looks like the revenue momentum will continue into the fourth quarter.\" Amazon became the latest tech company to have outperformed in an otherwise dreary earnings season. About 84 percent of technology companies that have reported so far beat earnings estimates, and 63 percent have beat revenue projections. Amazon's third-quarter revenue was $17.1 billion, up from $13.8 billion in the comparable period a year earlier. The average analyst estimate was $16.8 billion. Amazon is trying to evolve from an online retailer into a broader technology company offering consumer gadgets such as tablets and cloud-computing services to companies and governments. The evolution has entailed making investments in technology and content, such as videos and music, all while building distribution centers across the United States and expanding its presence in competitive overseas markets such as China. Amazon is spending billions of dollars to expand, and that has taken a toll on earnings. But some investors think the move will pay off as the spending tapers and margins expand. Amazon's gross profit margin - a closely watched measure of earnings that excludes several expenses - was 28.6 percent in the second quarter, one of the highest levels in more than a decade by analysts' reckoning. Third-quarter margins were about 28 percent, in line with what analysts had expected. The company's net loss was $41 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, narrowing from a net loss of $274 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2012. Amazon's stock has gained about 30 percent this year and is valued at 131 times its projected 2014 earnings, among the highest valuations in the market. After rising 1.7 percent in Thursday's session, Amazon shares climbed more than 8 percent in after-hours trading, to about $360. \"The takeaway is that the third-quarter sales show that the Amazon value proposition is striking a chord with consumers,\" Hottovy said.

        "content": " Well, that was quick. Just a day after Apple announced its newest full-sized tablet, the iPad Air, Amazon rolled out a new banner ad on its homepage proclaiming the Kindle Fire HDX is \"lighter than Air.\" And it is true \u2014 both of the latest models of the Kindle Fire are lighter than their Apple competitors: The larger model of the Kindle Fire HDX weighs 0.82 pounds to the iPad Air's weight of 1 pound. And the smaller Fire is 0.66 pounds to the new iPad mini with retina display's 0.73 pounds. But it's also worth noting that it's not a straight comparison. For one, the screens on both Kindle Fire HDX models are smaller than on their corresponding iPads. The larger Kindle Fire HDX is 8.9 inches to the iPad Air's 9.7, which retains the screen size of the standard iPad. The smaller Kindle Fire is 7 inches to the iPad mini's 7.9 inches. The construction of the two devices is also different. The iPads are made with aluminum bodies to preserve Apple's premium design philosophy, while the Kindle Fire HDX models show Amazon's low-price philosophy with plastic bodies. Amazon has improved the feel of its tablets with this latest model. But it's still pretty clear that its design has a different goal: to be made inexpensively to keep prices low. Still, the quick turnaround on the ad \u2014 and the fact that it calls the iPad Air out by name \u2014 shows that it's going to be a particularly fierce holiday season in the tablet market, as Amazon and Apple duke it out with Microsoft, Nokia, and Google for a place in gift-wrapped boxes across the world. In the United States, as Bloomberg reported last month, Amazon had a 4.6 percent share of the market ahead of its HDX launch, as compared to Apple's 50.7 percent. But the online retailer has been pushing its tablet hard and improving core features such as browsing and typing as well as introducing a new 24/7 customer service feature. That's a calculated move to go after first-time tablet owners and for those looking for something cheap that serves their basic needs.

But it could add this with a few lines of code, and most users probably wouldn't know.\" NSA delayed anti-leak software at base where Snowden worked. Reuters, citing unidentified current and former U.S. officials, reports that \"before Snowden joined Booz Allen Hamilton last spring and was assigned to the NSA site as a systems administrator, other U.S. government facilities had begun to install software designed to spot attempts by unauthorized people to access or download data.\" However, the report says, the NSA facility in Hawaii where Snowden was assigned to work delayed implementing the system due to \"insufficient bandwidth.\"",

        "name": "PayPal shows strength, but competitors loom; Amazon\u2019s payment service ",
        "content": " Times are good for online payments, with PayPal reporting a 12 percent jump in revenue in the last quarter, even as parent company eBay reported a lower-than-expected future outlook, including the holiday season. On an earnings call, eBay chief executive John Donahoe said that PayPal users were up 17 percent in the past quarter and that the service now weighs in at 137 million users. And 32 percent of those users are coming in through mobile devices. Things are good for PayPal right now, but eBay is far from the only one trying to work out the future of mobile payments, and it's facing competition from just about every side. The business of controlling online identity -- particularly in the payment world -- is becoming an increasingly attractive one to tech titans and payment processors alike. Managing passwords is one of the biggest hassles for consumers in the digital age, particularly when it involves remembering dozens of credentials for different accounts. Solving that problem securely is big business, and one reason why companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are happy to let folks use sign-in credentials for their networks on other sites. And when companies can hook payment processing into that equation, it makes their networks even stronger -- hence one reason why PayPal continues to work on becoming a payment option across the Web. But new competitors pop up every day. Most recently, Amazon stepped into the ring, announcing a new program, \"Login and Pay,\" that allows users to do just that by using their Amazon accounts to let the tech titan process and authorize payments. \"Given the size of Amazon and the trust they've built up as a brand over all these years, for social login over all, this is a positive for all involved,\" said Bill Piwonka, vice president of marketing for the social log-in firm Janrain. Janrain works with several companies, including Amazon, to deploy social login services. Based on its reputation, Piwonka said that he thinks Amazon will see long-term success in the space as it signs up more stores to use its service. Patrick Salyer, the chief executive of the social login company Gigya , said that while other firms such as Google have already launched their own payment services tied to social log-in, Amazon's program poses the biggest competition for PayPal, because the company has a wide reach and an established past as a retailers. Scale, he said, is the firm's greatest advantage. \"Over 200 million consumers that use product on a regular basis,\" he said. Salyer, whose firm works with companies including ABC and Barnes and Noble, also said that he expects the worlds of identity authentication and payment processing to move closer together in the future, particularly as more payments are processed on mobile devices, which have smaller screens and make the annoying process of logging in even more frustrating. He also said that he expects that companies providing social login services will find their services deployed in brick-and-mortar stores down the line, because the process can be fairly seamless. Mobile apps that have your payment information stored in them \u2014 such as Amazon's, he said \u2014 let you make purchases with a single tap. \"The ability to take that to other apps will be very, very appealing to retailers,\" he said. Piwonka did note, however, that if consumers aren't comfortable with letting login providers have information about the other Web sites they visit, that most services still offer the option to create accounts with separate usernames and passwords. \"If you are concerned that doohickey.com or brand.com is going to misuse your data, if you have that concern, then you don't have to use your Amazon, Facebook or Google account,\" he said. \"That's a different usage model than social login.\" (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

        "name": "Review: Kindle Fire HDX; Amazon\u2019s tablet is an improvement over previous models, but still best for true Amazon fans. ",
        "content": " You might be thinking about picking up your pumpkins right now, but companies are already gearing up some fierce competition for your holiday gift dollars. With the new Kindle Fire HDX, Amazon is refreshing its play in the tablet world, with an eye toward smaller, reading-focused tablets such as the iPad mini and Nexus 7. Amazon loaned The Washington Post a review unit of its most basic model: a 7-inch, 16 GB Kindle Fire with WiFi connectivity. Here's how it stacks up: Hardware: Physically, the Kindle Fire HDX is a major improvement over previous models. Amazon apparently took heed of earlier feedback about hardware, cutting a good deal of bulk from the tablet and making such changes as moving the volume and power buttons to more logical spots on the device. The Fire HDX also has angled edges that make it easier to hold the tablet with one hand or two hands. Internally, the tablet has a faster processor that mostly eliminates the lag that affected older models, though I found its keyboard is still not as responsive as its competitors'. It's still not a tablet I would choose for work \u2014 though Amazon is marketing the Fire HDX and its security features to businesses. The screen is bright and crisp for video, and users get a 30-day free trial of Amazon's Prime Service, which includes access to Prime Instant Video. The Fire is slightly easier to read in bright light (there's been little direct sunlight to test in D.C. lately) than other tablets, such as the iPad mini. Those who want a dedicated reading device are still best off with an e-ink reader. Software: Amazon has made some revamps to the tablet's appearance (it looks a little more Apple, with the shape of its icons). But ,looks aside, the navigation here is designed to make it smoother to get from your most recent apps, to all your apps \u2014 and back. The effect, overall, is that it is easier to get from place to place on the tablet. The firm's Silk browser has also been improved, though it's still not as smooth as Apple's Safari or Google's Chrome. But the redesign makes it easier to juggle multiple sites and move more quickly to most-used sites. There's also a new interface for Amazon shopping on the tablet, allowing consumers to save items they're interested in buying without having to put them straight into their cars. Make no mistake, this tablet is designed to help Amazon sell its own goods. Where the Fire continues to falls down, however, is in its app selection. Because Amazon uses its own version of Android, only a limited number of programs run on the Kindle. That's fine if you're using the tablet mostly to read, shop and watch video on Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime. But if you want to use the tablet for much more, you won't have nearly as many choices as you would on other tablets. Usability: There's clearly been a lot of attention paid to making the Fire more intuitive. But if you still haven't quite caught on, you can get help with in-device access to a customer service line by swiping down from the top of the screen and hitting the \"Mayday\" button. That will call up a customer service representative, live, on the screen. The battery life projection from Amazon puts the tablet at over 11 hours of mixed use, with 17 hours of just reading. In the course of testing, the battery came in a under that \u2014 about nine hours of battery life with mixed use, while putting the tablet through its paces. Other: The Fire HDX also hooks into the Amazon ecosystem. Users can link the books they read on the Kindle with other Amazon properties such as Goodreads or Audible. And, Amazon promises, Kindle Fire HDX owners will soon be able to shoot the video they're watching on their tablets to their televisions, via partnerships with set-top box and console makers. In terms of gripes, the smaller version of the tablet doesn't have a rear-facing camera \u2014 though the larger version does \u2014 which means that video conferencing isn't super-easy. The front-facing camera works fine for basic video and photos, but this is hardly going to become your primary shooter. But the newest Fire has at least one real plus that's not even part of the tablet \u2014 the Origami cover. Sold separately for $50 and up, the magnetic cover folds so that a user can pop a Kindle on it and rotate the Kindle in any direction without having to rearrange the fold. The cover also wakes up the tablet when it's opened and pulled back and puts it to sleep when it's placed back down over the screen. It would have been good to have the cover included with the tablet, of course, but it's a nice addition if you have the $50 to spare. Bottom line: The newest Kindle Fire HDX is Amazon's strongest tablet to date, but is still best suited to Amazon's most loyal customers \u2014 or those who want to become loyal Amazon customers. The tablet still doesn't have the breadth of apps to compete with Apple, Google or Samsung offerings. If that doesn't bother you, the price is a plus for the quality of hardware you get. The base, 16 GB, WiFi tablet starts at $229. It also comes in 32 GB and 64 GB versions, and users have the option of adding LTE service with either AT&T or Verizon. Users can also choose to add $15 to the price of any of the tablets to opt out of Amazon's \"special offers\" program, which displays certain discounts and ads on the device's screen savers. Amazon has given the tablet an Oct. 18 release date. According to Amazon's Web site, however, orders placed now are expected to ship the week of Oct. 28.

        "name": "The Obamacare implosion is worse than you think; It\u2019s worse than you think. ",
        "content": " Obamacare is imploding. But thanks to the government shutdown, everyone is talking about the implosion of the GOP instead. The shutdown drama has distracted from the fact that Obamacare's debut is worse than many realize \u2014 and it threatens the fundamental viability of the law itself. The administration claims the Obamacare online exchanges crashed because the Web site got more than 8 million hits in the first week. Please. You know how many people visit Amazon.com every week? More than 70 million. The difference is: 1.) Amazon seldom crashes, and 2.) on Amazon, people actually buy something. It appears virtually no one is buying Obamacare. While administration officials brag about how many visitors the site is getting, they refuse to divulge how many people actually signed up. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was asked that directly by Jon Stewart on \"The Daily Show.\" \"Fully enrolled?\" Sebelius stuttered. \"I can't tell you. Because I don't know.\" That is a frightening admission of incompetence. If the Obama administration can't even track how many people signed up, how on earth is it going to verify whether those people are eligible for subsidies? How will it protect against fraud? The Post reported this past weekend that the failure of the Web site is worse than previously known: \"Even when consumers have been able to sign up, insurers sometimes can't tell who their new customers are because of a separate set of computer defects.\" It turns out that in some 99 percent of applications, the Obamacare site did not provide insurers with enough verifiable information to enroll people in their plans. Computer experts say the problems with the site are not because of heavy traffic but are the result of structural flaws in system architecture. It is going to take months to rebuild it. That raises a question: If the federal government can't manage a simple Web site, how on earth is it going to manage the health care of millions of Americans? It also means that President Obama may have no choice but to delay the individual mandate. As my American Enterprise Institute colleague, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, points out, how can Obama penalize people for not having health insurance if the government's Web site to provide that insurance doesn't work? Without the individual mandate, Obamacare unravels. The only way the law works is if the government forces young, healthy people into it by threatening them with penalties for not carrying health insurance. But if there is no penalty for not signing up, then fewer Americans will sign up. Even if the administration manages to fix the Web site and finally implement the individual mandate, people still may not join \u2014 because the plans being offered are so unattractive. To entice people to join the exchanges, the administration forced insurers to offer low monthly premiums and cover people with preexisting conditions. Insurers have responded by increasing deductibles \u2014 the out-of-pocket costs people must pay before insurance benefits kick in \u2014 to stratospheric levels. According to an analysis this weekend by the president's hometown paper, the Chicago Tribune, \"21 of the 22 lowest-priced plans offered on the Illinois health insurance exchange for Cook County have annual deductibles of more than $4,000 for an individual and $8,000 for family coverage. Plans with the least expensive monthly premiums \u2014 highlighted by state and federal officials as proof the new law will keep costs low for consumers \u2014 have deductibles as high as $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for families.\" Even with federal subsidies, few Americans will bother to buy insurance with a $4,000 to $12,700 deductible \u2014 and millions won't even be eligible for the subsidies. If enough Americans don't join the exchanges, Obamacare collapses. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the administration needs at least 7 million people to join the exchanges for Obamacare to be financially viable. While the administration won't reveal sign-up rates, London's Daily Mail reported that total sign-ups in the first week were just 51,000 people. If accurate, that would mean they have just 6,949,000 more to go to break even. Bottom line: It turns out Obamacare is blowing itself up just fine without Republican help. Far from a few \"glitches,\" the president's signature program is in free fall after only a week. But instead of focusing on the Obamacare debacle, the news is filled with stories about . . . the government shutdown. The irony is, the shutdown was intended to stop Obamacare. Instead, it is rescuing Obama from his own incompetence.",

        "content": " Amazon Web Services has prevailed in its lawsuit against the government over a cloud computing contract with the CIA, but competitor IBM has vowed to appeal the decision. The two companies have been sparring over the high-profile contract, which was first awarded to Amazon. (Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post and Capital Business.) IBM protested the award to the Government Accountability Office, which found merit in the complaint and recommended the CIA reopen the competition. Amazon Web Services then took the battle to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Judge Thomas C. Wheeler granted Amazon's motion and restored the original contract in a ruling last week. The CIA \"and AWS may immediately resume performance of the [commercial cloud services] contract,\" the judge wrote. Amazon said in a statement that it looks \"forward to resuming our work on this important contract,\" but IBM said in its own statement that it plans to appeal. \"This court decision seems especially inappropriate in light of the current times, since IBM's bid was superior in many ways, including being substantially more cost-effective,\" the company added. The CIA said in a statement that it's \"pleased that it can now move forward with procuring critical cloud services for the intelligence community.\" Arlington-based CACI International said last week that it has agreed to buy McLean-based Six3 Systems from private equity firm GTCR for $820 million to boost its cyber and intelligence work. Six3 employs about 1,600 and its revenue for the year is expected to be about $470 million, CACI said. The acquisition is the largest in CACI's history of 57 deals, said Ken Asbury, the company's chief executive. \"We're taking the long-term view of where the market's going to go,\" Asbury said in an interview last week. \"We think that the market's shifting to capable companies that are affordable.\" He said Six3 will become a business group within CACI and retain its name and its leadership team. \"We sort of don't want to mess with their success,\" he said. Astrophysics, which supplies X-ray inspection systems, said last week it has opened an office in Crystal City to better reach its government customers. The company's headquarters is in the City of Industry, Calif. The office is to be led by Mark Laustra, who previously led government sales at Smiths Detection, the company said in its announcement. The 140-employee Astrophysics also has a facility in Ontario, Calif. The GAO has denied a protest filed by Fairfax-based SoBran against a Social Security Administration contract awarded to Silver Spring-based Financial & Realty Services for warehouse support services. SoBran, the incumbent, had argued that its past performance was not rated highly enough. The company had earned a \"very good\" rating while FRS earned \"neutral,\" but SoBran priced its proposal at $5.7 million, higher than the FRS price of just under $5.3 million. The GAO noted that the \"contracting officer then determined that the protester's superior performance was not worth the $425,000 price differential\" and backed the agency.

        "name": "The Washington Post closes sale to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos; Transfer ends eight decades of Graham family ownership, begins new era with tech billionaire ",
        "content": " Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos formally took over as the owner of The Washington Post on Tuesday, officially ending 80 years of local control of the newspaper by the Graham family. Bezos's $250 million purchase was completed as expected with the signing of sale documents. The signing transfers the newspaper and other assets from The Washington Post Co. to Nash Holdings, Bezos's private investment company. Bezos, who founded the online shopping company in 1994 and became a billionaire in the process, has vowed to continue the newspaper's long history of independent journalism. His technical and marketing savvy, long-term outlook and lack of an apparent ideological agenda made him an attractive steward for the paper, Post Co. chief executive Donald E. Graham said in August, when an agreement in principle was first disclosed. At the same time, Bezos, 49, has the deep pockets to sustain an enterprise that has been buffeted for years by declining readership and advertising, especially in the printed Post. The Post's new owner hasn't disclosed specific plans or changes he intends to make for the money-losing paper. But in earlier interviews and on a two-day visit to The Post's downtown Washington headquarters in early September, he suggested that he'll provide a financial cushion \u2014 or \"runway\" \u2014 that will allow The Post time to conduct experiments that could lead to a successful business model. The Washington Post Co. will continue to operate as a separate company without The Post newspaper. It is the parent company for a variety of businesses, including cable-TV systems, TV stations and the Kaplan education company. It will change its name to reflect the newspaper's sale, but a new name hasn't been announced yet. Graham will continue as chief executive of the renamed company. Although Bezos will head the new organization, the rest of the paper's management won't change. Publisher Katharine Weymouth will continue in that job, as will executive editor Martin Baron. Bezos himself will remain chief executive of Amazon, based in Seattle. He has said he will visit the paper periodically but will devote most of his attention to his \"day job\" running Amazon, which had revenue of $61 billion last year. Weymouth, who is Graham's niece, will be The Post's sole remaining connection to the family that has guided and shaped the newspaper for four generations. She is the great-granddaughter of Eugene Meyer, the financier who bought the paper at a bankruptcy auction in 1933 and built it with the help of his son-in-law, Philip L. Graham, and later Graham's widow and Meyer's daughter, Katharine Graham. Donald, the son of Philip and Katharine, became publisher of the newspaper and eventually succeeded his mother as chief executive of the parent company. In addition to The Post nameplate and its Springfield, Va., printing plant, Bezos is acquiring the Spanish-language El Tiempo newspaper, the free-distribution Express daily newspaper, the suburban Washington Gazette weeklies and 23 acres of undeveloped land in Charles County, Md. In a note to employees on Tuesday, Katharine Weymouth said, \"We are officially under new ownership, and a new era for The Washington Post begins.\" She thanked her uncle for helping the newspaper remain \"a standard-bearer for world-class news reporting and analysis,\" adding, \"with Jeff's leadership, we will build on that foundation and take The Post to new heights.\" The Washington Post Co.'s stock closed at $628.54 per share, up $17.19, or 2.8 percent, in Tuesday's trading. The close was a five-year high for the stock, which has been rising steadily this year. paul.farhi@washpost.com",
