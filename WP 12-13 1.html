All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon announced all-new Kindle models Wednesday morning, adding a new family of &quot;HDX&quot; tablets and dropping the price of the Kindle Fire HD to $139.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The firm is continuing to evolve its two-year-old Kindle line to emerge as a top competitor in the tablet world. The latest, the Kindle Fire HDX, boasts a fast processor, gaming-quality graphics engine and up to 11 hours of battery life — indicating that it&#39;s certainly not looking to compete only on price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The tablet comes in two sizes — either 7 inches or 8.9 inches — and starts at $229 for the smaller model. The larger model costs $379. Both models come with 16 GB of memory; upgrading to 32 GB or 64 GB will cost extra. Also, adding support for 4G networks bumps the price up $100.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The tablet also comes with the option for a a new &quot;Origami&quot; cover that will wake up the tablet when opened, put it to sleep when closed and act as a stand in portrait or landscape orientations. The plastic covers cost $50 or $55, depending on tablet screen size. Leather versions will cost $65 or $70.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With the new tablets, users who subscribe to Amazon&#39;s Prime service will also be able to download and watch some movies and TV shows offline, for free, for up to 30 days. Titles, once watched, can stay on the device for up to 48 hours, according to a report from All Things Digital.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">New features in the Kindle&#39;s OS are aimed at making downloads quicker and making it easier for folks to use their Amazon content across devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Kindle Fire HDX also comes with a new feature called &quot;Mayday,&quot; which provides Kindle users one-click access to technical support. According to a commercial for the feature on the company&#39;s Web site, tapping the on-screen button will immediately connect users with a live technician over video chat.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;With the Mayday button, our goal is to revolutionize tech support,&quot; said Jeff Bezos, Amazon&#39;s chief executive in a media statement. &quot;With a single tap, an Amazon expert will appear on your Fire HDX and can co-pilot you through any feature by drawing on your screen, walking you through how to do something yourself, or doing it for you—whatever works best.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The addition of this button could make the Kindle line more attractive to first-time tablet owners, who would be able to sort through some technical problems themselves rather than having to rely on friends or family.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s decision to cut the price on the Kindle Fire HD should also appeal to those looking for a low-priced tablet — the new $139 price tag actually makes the tablet less expensive than the firm&#39;s Kindle Paperwhite 3G e-reader.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">(Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos has agreed to buy The Washington Post newspaper.) </a><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" target="_blank">Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130925e99p003ec</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_004.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2">-business-on-it</a><a name="bookmark3">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SRA releases new federal cloud service; The move makes SRA The latest firm to try to position its offerings for the government’s fast-changing technology needs.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Mohana Ravindranath 434 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16 September 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The government contracting firm SRA International added a new service last week to help federal agencies manage security concerns when moving to the cloud, the latest firm to try to position its offerings for the government&#39;s fast-changing technology needs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new offering, called Stratify, has a ready-made infrastructure for reporting security concerns and meeting federal cybersecurity requirements. Stratify is designed to work in tandem with external cloud services, including Amazon Web Services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fairfax-based firm said it added the service in response to increased demand for cloud help from federal clients in the face of budget cuts, said Majed Saadi, SRA&#39;s director of cloud computing practice. &quot;The problem has always been they&#39;re afraid to move to the cloud and lose any type of security controls they have in their own data centers.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SRA is one of an emerging class of IT companies — intermediaries providing cloud computing support, without actually providing the cloud service itself. Analysts sometimes dub this model &quot;cloud brokerage.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company doesn&#39;t intend to directly provide cloud services, Saadi said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;The price of cloud services has been dropping, so there&#39;s really not a space for us to compete,&quot; he said.&quot;But there&#39;s a huge gap we&#39;re trying to fill by helping our customers migrate to the cloud whenever it makes sense, create good strategies to back up the migration, to understand how to migrate and what to migrate, and finally manage the cloud environments.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SRA isn&#39;t alone. Laurel-based IT firm Aquilent also supports federal agencies as they transition to the cloud, along with hundreds of other companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The model is growing in popularity as vendors try to defend against the &quot;rapid commoditization of their existing [cloud] services business&quot; and opt instead for a service delivery model, Forrester analyst Stefan Reid said in a report titled &quot;Cloud Broker — A New Business Model Paradigm.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2012, Forrester analysts estimated cloud brokers could generate about $96 million in revenue worldwide.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Intermediaries such as SRA also guide clients through the technology selection process, drawing from services such as Amazon Web Services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re [platform] agnostic,&quot; Saadi said. &quot;We work with our customers based on their requirements to identify the right service ... It&#39;s going to be a heterogeneous ecosystem where you might use a service from Amazon, another from another service provider, another from a third.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">mohana.ravindranath@washpost.com Document WPCOM00020130916e99g000ru</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_005.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4">-business-on-it</a><a name="bookmark5">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5 take-aways from Amazon’s public sector summit; This year, like last, the conference marketed Amazon Web Services to federal clients.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Mohana Ravindranath 568 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12 September 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

In break-out sessions, representatives from Amazon, smaller tech companies that deliver Amazon&#39;s services, and officials from the public sector discussed cloud applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">More than 600 government agencies and 2,400 educational institutions have implemented Amazon Web Services, according to the company. Amazon doesn&#39;t release revenue figures for its cloud offerings, but it&#39;s certainly the market leader in federal cloud computing, Gartner analyst Lydia Leong said. The company isn&#39;t alone in the space — competitors include Verizon&#39;s Terremark — but it is one of few with a product designed specifically for federal clients, she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are a few take-aways from the summit:</p><ol id="l1"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Not everything belongs in the cloud</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In his keynote address, Baitman described the Health and Human Service Department&#39;s adoption of cloud technologies. For instance, HHS currently uses AWS to power HealthData.gov, a public online health data repository for entrepreneurs and scientists.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Baitman noted that adoption of new technology must be strategic and cost-effective, especially in the public sector. Agencies will likely discover that not all operations necessarily work better in the cloud, though some might.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The cloud isn&#39;t the answer for everything,&quot; he said.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">One cloud provider won&#39;t necessarily rule the rest</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For instance, Health and Human Services encourages many cloud providers to meet federal technology standards, Baitman said. An ultimate cloud solution might involve services from various providers such as Amazon and its competitors, Salesforce and Verizon&#39;s Terremark.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">A &quot;cloud broker&quot; model is emerging</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tech companies can generate revenue by helping clients integrate cloud technology, instead of actually providing the cloud technology itself, Baitman explained. Many of Amazon&#39;s tech partners, including SRA and Aquilent, offer AWS and other cloud solutions, often serving as &quot;cloud brokers&quot;.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">There are barriers to adoption</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Transitioning entire server systems to the cloud can be challenging for government clients with complex databases, said Max Peterson, Amazon Web Services&#39; director of partners and contracts: &quot;Customers sometimes don&#39;t know where to begin.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Peterson noted that the federal security accreditation system has improved in the past two years, but federal clients are sometimes still concerned about the risks of new technology.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Public education may benefit from the cloud</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloud adoption could help public schools process large volumes of learning analytics, helping educators improve material, said Karen Cator, chief executive of Digital Promise, an educational nonprofit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">School systems &quot;can&#39;t afford the capacity required to manage a server-based farm,&quot; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some states school systems — North Carolina&#39;s, for instance — are already transitioning data to the cloud, she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:mohana.ravindranath@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">Disclosure: Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos has reached a deal to buy The Washington Post. </a><a href="mailto:mohana.ravindranath@washpost.com" target="_blank">mohana.ravindranath@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130911e99b0050n</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_006.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark6">-lifestyle-style</a><a name="bookmark7">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trudeau extends ‘Doonesbury’ sabbatical to finish work on new TV series ‘Alpha House’; Cartoonist is being kept busy with ‘Alpha House,’ his new TV series for Amazon Prime.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Michael Cavna 469 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9 September 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s the problem with remodeling. In trying to build his own Alpha House, Garry Trudeau says he has hit an immovable wall.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The &quot;Doonesbury&quot; cartoonist has been on sabbatical this summer as he readies his Washington-based TV series, &quot;Alpha House,&quot; one of the inaugural projects for Amazon Studios. That has meant a season of &quot;Doonesbury Flashbacks&quot; — a.k.a. reruns — on the comics page, with the comic strip&#39;s return originally slated for Labor Day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, like a Groundhog Day alert, comes new word: &quot;Doonesbury&quot; fans will get 10 more weeks of darkness. Original strips are now scheduled to return on the week of Nov. 18. The weekly color strip returned on Sunday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trudeau &quot;has informed us that following &#39;Doonesbury&#39;s&#39; return to Sunday comic pages, and as he continues to write and produce &#39;Alpha House&#39; for Amazon Prime, he has been forced to acknowledge a cruel reality: He&#39;s human,&quot; his syndicate, the Kansas City-based Universal Uclick, said in a note to client editors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I have hit the wall,&quot; Trudeau said in the announcement. &quot;This is a painful decision, but as the deadline loomed, I had to finally concede that the demands of completing the show have made it impossible for me to return to the strip on schedule.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Doonesbury,&quot; which in 1975 became the first comic strip to win a Pulitzer Prize (for its satirizing of Watergate), went on sabbatical June 10. Trudeau decided he needed the break after his new live-action Capitol Hill comedy, &quot;Alpha House,&quot; was officially picked up by Amazon Studios, an enterprise of Amazon.com, whose chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, will complete his $250 million purchase of The Washington Post in the next few weeks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Alpha House&quot; is one of the first five series Amazon Studios greenlighted as it moves into the world of original scripted programming. The series, which stars John Goodman and Clark Johnson, centers on the lives of four Republican senators who share a residence. The Beltway-savvy satire was inspired by the true-life living arrangements of four prominent Democrats — after Trudeau read a news story in 2007 about roomies Rep. George Miller (Calif.), Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Rep. Bill Delahunt (Mass.) sharing a two-bedroom house in the shadow of the Capitol dome.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trudeau&#39;s previous screen projects include Robert Altman&#39;s Emmy-winning HBO political series &quot;Tanner &#39;88&quot; and the Sundance Channel sequel, &quot;Tanner on Tanner.&quot; He also wrote the animated &quot;A Doonesbury Special,&quot; which received an Oscar nomination and a Cannes jury prize.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:michael.cavna@washpost.com">michael.cavna@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130908e998004jy</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_007.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark8">-lifestyle-style</a><a name="bookmark9">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeffrey Bezos, Washington Post’s next owner, aims for a new ‘golden era’ at the newspaper; He says he’s eager to start asking questions and conducting experiments as quest begins.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Paul Farhi 1,410 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 September 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeffrey P. Bezos, the next owner of The Washington Post, says he doesn&#39;t have all the answers for what&#39;s ailing the newspaper industry or for the financially challenged news organization he is preparing to buy. But he says he&#39;s eager to start asking questions and conducting experiments in the quest for a new &quot;golden era&quot; at The Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In his first interview since his $250 million purchase of The Post was announced in early August, Bezos said his basic approach to operating the business will be similar to the philosophy that has guided him in building Amazon.com from a start-up in 1995 to an Internet colossus with $61 billion in sales last year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;We&#39;ve had three big ideas at Amazon that we&#39;ve stuck with for 18 years, and they&#39;re the reason we&#39;re successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient,&quot; he said. &quot;If you replace &#39;customer&#39; with &#39;reader,&#39; that approach, that point of view, can be successful at The Post, too.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos, 49, spoke via phone from Seattle on Friday, four days before he was scheduled to visit The Post for the first time since the announcement of its purchase from The Washington Post Co. and the controlling Graham family. The sale, which shocked the news industry, is expected to close in October.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos said his major contribution to the business will be in offering his &quot;point of view&quot; in discussions with the paper&#39;s leadership about how the publication should evolve. He also said he provides &quot;runway&quot; — financial support over a lengthy period in which the management can experiment to find a profitable formula for delivering the news.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If we figure out a new golden era at The Post . . . that will be due to the ingenuity and inventiveness and experimentation of the team at The Post,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll be there with advice from a distance. If we solve that problem, I won&#39;t deserve credit for it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During his visit Tuesday and Wednesday, Bezos plans to meet with Post publisher Katharine Weymouth and top managers of the paper&#39;s business and editorial operations. He will tour the newsroom in downtown Washington and the production plant in suburban Springfield, Va.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wednesday&#39;s visit will be bracketed by meetings with Post journalists — first with about 20 reporters and editors in the morning and concluding with a town hall-style meeting with the entire newsroom in the afternoon. The last time Bezos encountered a roomful of the paper&#39;s journalists was in 1999, when he was the guest of Katharine Graham, the company&#39;s late chairman, during a luncheon interview with reporters and editors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Based on his comments in the interview Friday, Bezos appears unlikely to make any major decisions or pronouncements during his visit or propose any immediate changes. He said he is eager to meet with and listen to managers and learn about the news organization&#39;s operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Post is the first newspaper that Bezos has owned and will be operated as a stand-alone business, independent of Amazon. Bezos intends to keep his &quot;day job&quot; as chairman and chief executive of Amazon and will continue living in Seattle, where the company is based.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos is one of the world&#39;s richest men, with a net worth of around $24 billion, based on the current value of his Amazon stock holdings. His deep pockets, technological savvy and reputation as a long-term strategic thinker were among the attributes that Post Co. chief executive Donald E. Graham cited in selling him The Post after 80</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">years under the Graham family&#39;s control. Graham said he saw no alternative to continued investment, which would be difficult for a publicly traded company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Graham and Weymouth, his niece, quietly put the business up for sale earlier this year after concluding that The Post required an owner capable of making sustained investment in it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos agreed: &quot;It&#39;s important for The Post not just to survive, but to grow,&quot; he said. &quot;The product of The Post is still great. The piece that&#39;s missing is that it&#39;s a challenged business. No business can continue to shrink. That can only go on for so long before irrelevancy sets in.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the interview, Bezos stressed that he has no immediate fixes for newspapers in general or for The Post, which is beset by Web-based competition that has weakened its advertising base and steadily sapped its print readership.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Don was helpful in interviews [following the purchase] when he said, &#39;Mr. Bezos is a businessman, not a magician,&#39; &quot; Bezos said. &quot;I thanked him for that afterwards. In my experience, the way invention, innovation and change happen is [through] team effort. There&#39;s no lone genius who figures it all out and sends down the magic formula. You study, you debate, you brainstorm and the answers start to emerge. It takes time. Nothing happens quickly in this mode. You develop theories and hypotheses, but you don&#39;t know if readers will respond. You do as many experiments as rapidly as possible. &#39;Quickly&#39; in my mind would be years.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Bezos suggested that the current model for newspapers in the Internet era is deeply flawed: &quot;The Post is famous for its investigative journalism,&quot; he said. &quot;It pours energy and investment and sweat and dollars into uncovering important stories. And then a bunch of Web sites summarize that [work] in about four minutes and readers can access that news for free. One question is, how do you make a living in that kind of environment? If you can&#39;t, it&#39;s difficult to put the right resources behind it. Even behind a paywall [digital subscription], Web</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sites can summarize your work and make it available for free. From a reader point of view, the reader has to ask, &#39;Why should I pay you for all that journalistic effort when I can get it for free&#39; from another site?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although he said he reads The Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal regularly, Bezos didn&#39;t grow up immersed in newspapers or dreaming of being involved with one. His &quot;love affair,&quot; he said, has always been with &quot;the printed word in all its forms.&quot; Amazon started as an online book retailer; it now publishes its own books. It has also moved into video production, competing with Netflix and others in streaming original programs. Bezos&#39;s wife, MacKenzie, is a published novelist.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Internet and Amazon&#39;s launch of the Kindle e-reader convinced him that the printed word doesn&#39;t have to be on paper. &quot;The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author&#39;s world,&quot; Bezos said. &quot;Great writers create an alternative world. It doesn&#39;t matter if you enter that world&quot; via a digital or printed source.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After Graham broached the idea of Bezos buying the paper earlier this year, Bezos said he spent two months contemplating what he could bring to the business. He was convinced that The Post was &quot;an important institution,&quot; and he said he was optimistic about its future. But he needed time to think over a third issue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;I had to convince myself that I could bring something to the table,&quot; he said. &quot;I discussed this at great length with Don. I thought I could, because I could offer runway and some skill in technology and the Internet and a point of view about long-term thinking, reader focus and the willingness to experiment.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Added Bezos: &quot;I&#39;m a genetic optimist. I&#39;ve been told, &#39;Jeff, you&#39;re fooling yourself; the problem is unsolvable.&#39; But I don&#39;t think so. It just takes a lot of time, patience and experimentation.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asked how he saw The Post — as a local, national or international news organization — Bezos demurred. &quot;That&#39;s a question that needs to be answered in concert with the leadership team of The Post. Is it local? Or national? Is it something new?&quot; Whatever the mission, he said, The Post will have &quot;readers at its centerpiece. I&#39;m skeptical of any mission that has advertisers at its centerpiece. Whatever the mission is, it has news at its heart.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:paul.farhi@washpost.com">paul.farhi@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Craig Timberg contributed to this article.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post&#39;s new owner, Jeffrey P. Bezos, long wary of journalists, courted the paper&#39;s editors and reporters in a series of meetings Wednesday, saying that he is optimistic about the future of journalism and wants to create a &quot;daily ritual bundle&quot; that would appeal to a variety of readers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Amazon.com founder and chief executive, who has agreed to purchase The Post for $250 million, said he plans to invest in the paper and rejected the idea that news organizations could cut their way to profitability or stability, or attract advertisers without adding readers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To an organization weary from more than a decade of newsroom buyouts and cutbacks, Bezos, when asked how he would define success, replied: growth. Continuing to contract by cutting the staff would lead to extinction, he said, &quot;or, at best, irrelevance.&quot; He told a group of reporters and editors Wednesday morning that &quot;making money isn&#39;t enough. It also has to be growing.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What has been happening over the last few years can&#39;t continue to happen,&quot; Bezos said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;All businesses need to be young forever. If your customer base ages with you, you&#39;re Woolworth&#39;s,&quot; added Bezos, who created the world&#39;s leading online retailer. &quot;The number one rule has to be: Don&#39;t be boring.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He mentioned two pieces from this week&#39;s paper that he found particularly compelling: an obituary of the stereotype-defying, widely-known bouncer/doorman at the popular 9:30 Club and the &quot;9 questions about Syria&quot; primer that ran initially online and later in print.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos seemed relaxed, said several people who attended the meetings. He didn&#39;t prepare any remarks. He gave long, thoughtful, nuanced answers to the questions, punctuated with a &quot;dramatic, forward-leaning laugh,&quot; as one attendee put it. Many of the people who attended the morning meeting said they were relieved and reassured by his answers. In the larger afternoon session, Bezos proved equally deft at projecting a combination of humility, self-confidence and purpose.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;When this was first announced, I got thousands of e-mails, outpourings of support and encouragement,&quot; Bezos said later at a standing room only afternoon meeting with the entire staff, &quot;and that is not normal. If I had purchased a snack food company I would not have gotten those e-mails. …The only reason that happens is that people care.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said the newspaper faced two business problems: the Rewrite Problem and the Debundling Problem.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the former, the newspaper could spend weeks or months on a project that a Web site like the Huffington Post could rewrite &quot;in 17 minutes.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the latter, whereas people once bought a paper and read and passed sections of it around, the Web has debundled the paper so that people can read one story and move on to a different site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We can&#39;t have people swooping in to read one article,&quot; he said, adding that the paper should not be seeking to bolster hits from such one-time casual readers. &quot;What you can&#39;t do is go for the lowest common denominator, because then what you have is mediocrity.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He repeatedly said that the success of The Post depends on its ability to draw readers into a &quot;daily ritual habit&quot; of reading across a collection of different topics — and paying for it. &quot;People will buy a package,&quot; Bezos said, &quot;they will not pay for a story.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Post introduced a digital subscription plan in July, although many types of readers such as students, government employees and members of the military do not need to pay for access.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos added that he was confident that old media like The Post could master the new technology landscape. &quot;There are arenas where the transformation was done by the incumbents,&quot; he said, citing the example of Amazon, which dominated the sale of print books and later adapted to the sale of e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He postulated that the tablet could offer a way of rebundling the newspaper, though he said he was &quot;less optimistic&quot; about a Web-based product becoming profitable. &quot;I&#39;m convinced that the reach of the tablet will give us a bigger paying audience.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;This is so unexplored, and nobody — this code has not been cracked,&quot; he said. &quot;But there are so many degrees of freedom, knobs that can be turned and things we can experiment with that I&#39;m confident there&#39;s something we can find that readers love and will be engaged with — and that we can charge for.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos&#39; acquisition of The Post took the media industry by surprise. Bezos dealt with Nancy B. Peretsman, a managing director at Allen &amp; Co., who contacted him on behalf of Donald Graham, the chief executive of The Washington Post Co., about buying the paper. He decided to buy the newspaper on the basis of what he called &quot;three gates.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He first considered whether The Post remained an important institution, which he said was clearly true.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Second, he weighed whether he could still be optimistic about its future, and he said his &quot;genetic optimism&quot; combined with his conclusion that The Post still retained an extremely talented staff of journalists led him to conclude that the company could be successful.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The third &quot;gate,&quot; he said, was whether he could personally make a difference, and he said he could because of lessons he has learned inventing Amazon.com, turning it into a disruptive force in an existing industry and creating packages or bundles that customers value.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He urged the paper&#39;s journalists to think about &quot;how are we going to be different. We should think big about what is the next golden age of The Washington Post.&quot; He said that he plans to invest in the paper and that some areas needed to expand and others to contract.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the afternoon, Robert Kaiser, who joined the paper six months before Bezos was born, asked him what &quot;a new golden era&quot; would look like for a paper that once had many more staffers and foreign and domestic bureaus.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;How many foreign bureaus in a golden era? I don&#39;t know,&quot; Bezos said. &quot;We can&#39;t go backwards. We also can&#39;t think small. We need to think big and lean into the future. The death knell for any enterprise is to glorify the past no matter how good it was, especially for an institution like the Washington Post which has such a hallowed past.&quot; He said &quot;it is super clear to me already that people are eager for a golden era… What it means we still need to figure out.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He said that the print edition of the paper remains &quot;very, very important&quot; both to readers and the business model and that &quot;the physical paper can be optimized for the local audience.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said that if he has both the print and a tablet edition in front of him, he would still choose the print edition because it is &quot;an elegant product that has evolved over decades.&quot; Digital editions of newspapers, meanwhile, are still adapting to the new ways in which people look for information.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He said that the content of the newspaper in the digital age should &quot;be a blend of human judgment and metrics,&quot; just as The Post has combined a wide range of features from comics to international news.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Should we stop doing investigative journalism because it&#39;s unrewarding and other people copy it? Should we stop?&quot; Bezos said. &quot;No, we have to figure out how to get back to that bundle, have to find things people will pay for. It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t want it. They say, &#39;I&#39;m not sure I want to pay for it,&#39; but they do want it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Many questions in the full staff meeting dealt with editorial as well as business issues. Bezos said he had no desire to change the staff of the editorial page even though editorial page editor Fred Hiatt offered to step aside.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I don&#39;t associate with any party,&quot; he said. &quot;I do have things I care about and some of those are public, like gay marriage.&quot; But, he said, &quot;I don&#39;t feel the need to have an opinion on every issue.&quot; He added, &quot;I&#39;m very happy to let the folks at the Post opine on those issues. I see no reason to change what we&#39;re doing.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He also said that reporters should &quot;feel free to cover Amazon any way you want, feel free to cover Jeff Bezos any way you want.&quot; He said he has felt in general that he and Amazon had been covered fairly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asked about his interest in buying a newspaper and his practice of not commenting for most news stories, Bezos said, &quot;the most powerful minds can hold powerful inconsistencies.&quot; He said he often declines to comment because he doesn&#39;t want his competition to know about his plans. &quot;We&#39;re not as silent or secretive as we&#39;re sometimes portrayed,&quot; he said, while conceding that &quot;we are on the quiet side.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I will never out-Don Don. Impossible,&quot; he said, referring to Don Graham in response to a question about what he would bring to the Washington community. &quot;I will have to do this as Jeff and it&#39;s going to be different for so many reasons, and one of them is that I&#39;m going to be in Seattle.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asked whether he regards The Post as simply an interesting business problem, Bezos recalled lying on the living room floor next to his grandfather watching the Watergate hearings. &quot;I do feel that newspapers and in particular the Washington Post are important components of free societies.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said he considers himself &quot;a kind of American exceptionalist&quot; and believes &quot;this is a good country.&quot; But he added that &quot;our elected officials are not perfect. Our regulators are not perfect.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I guess somebody could argue..[that] the Washington Post and New York Times are not as important as they used to be because we have Wikileaks. I don&#39;t buy that,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a whole class of things that wouldn&#39;t be found out that way. The credibility that an organization like the Washington Post brings is important. It would be doing a disservice to this organization for my motivations to be just business curiosity.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:steven.mufson@washpost.com">steven.mufson@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130904e994005bs</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_009.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark12">local</a><a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At 102, Martha Ann Miller&#39;s autobiography goes into second printing, and lands on Amazon.com ; The Arlington educator&#39;s first edition sold out, but a second edition is better, she says</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Tom Jackman 600 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5 September 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You may recall that last fall we learned that Arlington educator and historic figure Martha Ann Miller had published her autobiography at the age of 101, as she had promised when she turned 100. Called &quot;The First Century And Not Ready for the Rocking Chair Yet,&quot; it chronicled her colorful life and her time at Stratford Junior High School, now H-B Woodlawn Secondary Program in Arlington, including being one of the first teachers to teach black children at Virginia&#39;s first integrated school in 1959.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well you can&#39;t get that book any more. Miller sold them all. But in publishing, there&#39;s a little thing called a &quot;second printing.&quot; And Miller has ordered up a few hundred more copies of &quot;The First Century,&quot; and the second edition is &quot;nearly perfect,&quot; she told me Wednesday. &quot;The mistakes we found in the first edition are all corrected.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Miller, who retired in 1974 and then became a leader in the American Association of University Women, is also stepping boldly into the computer age. Where before you had to e-mail her personally to get a copy of her book, now you can go to Amazon.com (which I hear is a brilliantly run company) and order &quot;The First Century.&quot; Miller said that &quot;it may seem a little expensive to buy it on Amazon, but I&#39;ve read the book and it&#39;s worth every penny.&quot; Take it from the author. The hardcover is $40 and the paperback is $27.50.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Miller also is getting a new computer, and showed off her tech smarts by noting that she had bought one with Windows 7, instead of with the less highly rated Windows 8.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Miller started teaching math at Stratford in 1952, and two years later the U.S. Supreme Court handed down the landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling. But Virginia wasn&#39;t exactly leaping to abide by that precedent, and it wasn&#39;t until 1959 that a circuit court ordered black students admitted to an Arlington school. Stratford was the first.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The principals asked the teachers if we would be willing to teach black students,&quot; Miller wrote. &quot;Some teachers refused. I personally felt it was an insult to be asked this kind of question, and I, of course, volunteered, considering it an honor to have these students in my classroom.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With police acting as a protective force and the national media watching, four students entered Stratford on Feb. 2, 1959, and took math with Miller. &quot;I welcomed them into my class,&quot; Miller wrote, &quot;showed them where they could sit, and we went into our lesson. It was just a regular day.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Having accomplished her autobiography, and now working on the marketing, she&#39;s still getting around town. &quot;I&#39;m still going out and speaking to groups,&quot; she said, and she plans a visit soon to the newly renovated Wakefield High School in Arlington. She is also undertaking a membership report at her church, Clarendon United Methodist, where she&#39;s been a member for 69 years. And she&#39;s still not using her rocking chair.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are our previous looks at Miller on her 100th birthday, and then again last year after the book was published. Below is a video interview that Miller gave in 2011 to the AAUW, and gives you a good idea of how sharp, and inspirational, she is to this day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130905e995001me</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_010.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark14">-lifestyle-style</a><a name="bookmark15">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos to his future Washington Post journalists: Put the readers first; The Amazon chief and soon-to-be owner of the paper shared an upbeat vision as he met with the newsroom.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Paul Farhi;Craig Timberg 1,178 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5 September 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeffrey P. Bezos had a simple bit of advice for the staff of the newspaper he&#39;ll soon own: Put readers, not advertisers, first. Don&#39;t write to impress each other. And above all, &quot;Don&#39;t be boring.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a whirlwind series of meetings over two days, the Amazon.com billionaire charmed and disarmed rooms full of skeptical journalists with a relentlessly upbeat vision that evoked The Washington Post&#39;s best traditions while promising to update them for a technologically advanced new era.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Bezos plan for the news organization he has agreed to buy for $250million centers on recreating the &quot;daily ritual&quot; of reading The Post as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories. He was bullish about creating that experience on tablet computers, lukewarm about the prospects of doing so on the Web, and reassuring about the future of the old-fashioned newspaper itself — at least for the foreseeable future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;People will buy a package,&quot; Bezos said at one meeting of reporters and editors. &quot;They will not pay for a story.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos seemed relaxed throughout two days of meetings, including a town-hall-style session in The Post&#39;s community room before hundreds of journalists. He spoke without notes and joked often, punctuating some of his witticisms and self-deprecating comments with explosive laughter. He remained poised and good-humored from his perch on stage at the town-hall meeting despite fighting a balky sound system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos also repeatedly emphasized the importance of investigative journalism and said he was prepared to stand up to pressure in reporting stories that government officials might seek to suppress. He also said his political views were already in line with those of The Post&#39;s editorial page and would defer to its editor, Fred Hiatt, on many matters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I don&#39;t feel the need to have an opinion on every issue,&quot; Bezos said. &quot;I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t know much about things like Syria and foreign entanglements. I&#39;m happy to let the experts opine on that.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among those in attendance at the newsroom-wide meeting were former executive editors Ben Bradlee and Leonard Downie Jr., former managing editor Robert Kaiser and star investigative reporter Bob Woodward, lending the event an intergenerational bridge to the newspaper&#39;s storied past. (Donald E. Graham, whose family controlled the newspaper for 80 years, was not there, but his niece, Post publisher Katharine Weymouth, was in attendance).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After 90 minutes of hearing Bezos lay out his thoughts, Bradlee, 92, counted himself among those who came away with a positive first impression. &quot;I thought he was original,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s what impressed me the most.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Throughout the day, Bezos returned to his idea of using tablets as a key vehicle for reaching a new generation of readers. While saying The Post&#39;s print editions will remain for many years, he said tablet computers could offer readers a look and feel similar to a traditional printed paper.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;You have to figure out: How can we make the new thing? Because you have to acknowledge that the physical print business is in structural decline,&quot; he said. &quot;You can&#39;t pretend that that&#39;s not the case. You have to accept it and move forward. The death knell for any enterprise is to glorify the past, no matter how good it was,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">especially for an institution like The Washington Post, which has such a hallowed past.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In comments that cheered the newsroom, Bezos said The Post needed to grow in both revenue and readers, though he declined to say whether The Post newsroom would grow. &quot;What has been happening over the last</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">several years can&#39;t continue to happen,&quot; he said. &quot;If every year we cut the newsroom a little more and a little more and a little more, we know where that ends.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Or as he put it repeatedly in meetings: &quot;All businesses need to be forever young. If your customer base ages</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with you as a company, you&#39;re Woolworth&#39;s.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asked about the irony of his interest in buying a newspaper and Amazon&#39;s practice of not commenting for many news stories, Bezos laughed and responded, &quot;The most powerful minds can hold powerful inconsistencies.&quot; He said one reason he often declines to comment is because he does not want his competition to know about his plans. &quot;We&#39;re not as silent or secretive as we&#39;re sometimes portrayed,&quot; he said of Amazon, conceding that &quot;we are on the quiet side.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos, who will remain in Seattle after his purchase of The Post closes in October, sidestepped a question about his future involvement in the Washington area. &quot;I would never out-Don Don. Impossible,&quot; he said, referring to Graham. &quot;I will have to do this as Jeff. And it&#39;s going to be different for so many reasons, and one of them is that I&#39;m going to be in Seattle.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When asked to discuss Amazon&#39;s motives in cutting off Web services for WikiLeaks in 2010, a time of intense government scrutiny of the anti-secrecy site&#39;s disclosure of confidential military and diplomatic documents, Bezos said that the decision was made by unit managers and was not the result of government pressure. The company has previously said that WikiLeaks violated Amazon&#39;s terms of service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet Bezos made clear that though he believes in &quot;American exceptionalism,&quot; he sees The Post&#39;s traditional watchdog roles as essential.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re not perfect and our elected officials are not perfect and our regulators are not perfect,&quot; he said in the newsroom question-and-answer session. &quot;The credibility that an organization like The Washington Post brings is incredibly important.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The reaction to the new boss from around The Post&#39;s newsroom was widely favorable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What was most impressive was the combination of humility — that he doesn&#39;t have all the answers yet — and the confidence that he will somehow figure it out,&quot; said Marc Fisher, a veteran reporter and former Metro columnist.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Added Valerie Strauss, another Post veteran, who writes an education blog: &quot;There was a lot he didn&#39;t say, but what he did was well received.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You might remember that time last month when it was announced that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was buying the Washington Post. Today, there was a Post staff Q&amp;A with Bezos. While many of the questions surrounded the future of the Post, I decided to use the time to ask about Amazon&#39;s pursuit of CIA cloud computing contracts -- after all, one of the first rules of journalism is that you need to use access when you have it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So with that in mind, here&#39;s what I asked Bezos:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I can&#39;t imagine another time coming up I&#39;ll get this kind of access. So do you have any comment on Amazon&#39;s pursuit of CIA cloud contracts? Computer World reported that Amazon has 100 plus postings for engineers and technical positions requiring top secret clearance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Much to my surprise, rather than declining to comment, Bezos did respond -- after laughing a bit, and asking me to repeat the question.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First, he praised Amazon&#39;s cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services (AWS) as &quot;the leader in infrastructure cloud computing&quot; and explained to my less technically inclined colleagues that it basically sells &quot;computing time by the hour to other companies.&quot; Bezos went on the praise the team, calling it &quot;nimble&quot; with a high &quot;rate of invention.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then Bezos discussed the specifics of the CIA contract:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The story here is that we won a contract with the CIA. And IBM protested the contract, and now it&#39;s either going to get rebid or they&#39;re going to decide to rebid it based on litigation. But if you had told anybody even two years ago that IBM would challenge Amazon for a CIA contract, people would be amazed. What that team has done in a very short time is remarkable. Their product offering is far ahead of anyone else. Mostly because they started so early and worked so hard on it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And that was it. So, he did comment, but didn&#39;t really say much more praising his team and repeating what was already public knowledge. Clearly, the man has experience dealing with the press.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to get in a follow-up to ask if I get into the invitation-only recruiting event for technical folks with top secret clearance reportedly scheduled for Sept. 24 and 25 in Herndon, Va.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To the best of my knowledge, I remain employed by The Washington Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">View Photo Gallery —Jeffrey P.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon introduced a new version of its Kindle Paperwhite e-reader Tuesday, showing that it&#39;s happy to play both sides of a conflict between e-book readers and tablets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new version of Amazon&#39;s light-up e-reader, the company said in a statement Tuesday, makes a number of improvements to its most technologically advanced line of e-ink, black-and-white e-readers, with features such as higher contrast, integration with the reading site Goodreads, and the option to engage more with books by making vocabulary lists, adding in-line footnotes and a kid-focused program that gives readers &quot;achievements&quot; for hitting reading milestones.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">E-readers saw a burst of popularity, particularly in 2012, but analysis firms such as IDC found in early 2013 that the single-focus devices were rapidly losing ground to tablets as users looked for more robust reading devices — particularly as tablet prices continue to drop.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s been bad news for companies like Sony, which saw its e-reader woes outlined in a New York Times article this weekend. According to that report, Amazon has quickly taken market share from Japanese-owned e-reader firms such as Sony and Kobo in large part thanks to its broad catalog of books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Amazon, however, the value of an e-reader or tablet comes not necessarily through the money it makes off of the device but rather the continued revenue stream off of the books it can sell through those devices. As a result, the company is willing to price its devices at a point that gives it very low profit margins.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s true of the new Kindle Paperwhite, which costs just $119 — the same as the original device — for the most-basic WiFi model. Adding 3G capability costs an additional $70, for a price of $189. The reader is expected to ship on November 5, and is up for pre-order now.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">(Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos has agreed to buy The Washington Post newspaper.) </a><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" target="_blank">Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130903e993004jz</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_013.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark20">-business-capitalbusiness</a><a name="bookmark21">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services, IBM battle over high-profile CIA cloud contract</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Marjorie Censer 774 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2 September 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An ongoing fight between Amazon Web Services and IBM over a cloud computing contract with the CIA is bringing to a climax questions about what kind of company is best positioned to provide the government with the new technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s not unusual for government contractors to wrestle over work by, for instance, filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office, but the dispute between these tech giants has taken a far more aggressive turn, with Amazon suggesting in court papers that IBM is just a staid government contractor that is in over its head in the fast-evolving cloud world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The stakes are all the larger as federal spending slows, and opportunities grow more limited to claim a high-profile contract.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Web-based computing has become a major government focus in the several years since Vivek Kundra, the former U.S. chief information officer (and the first to hold that role), said that federal agencies should embrace a &quot;cloud-first&quot; approach. Cloud computing allows users to access a pool of Internet-based servers and applications, rather than invest in their own computing infrastructure and is meant to be both cheaper and more efficient.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since then, government contractors large and small have embraced the cloud, finding ways to help federal agencies move their e-mail and other services to the technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The shift has also opened the door to newer entrants, such as Amazon Web Services, which has long focused on cloud computing but was less accustomed to working with federal agencies. About the same time Kundra gave his stamp of approval to the cloud, Amazon hired Teresa Carlson, who headed Microsoft&#39;s federal business, to run its own public sector business. (Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos recently agreed to buy The Washington Post.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Amazon Web Services has quickly made friends in government agencies, the CIA deal represented a critical turning point.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon initially won the contract despite a much higher bid, judged by the government to be $148.1 million compared with IBM&#39;s bid of $93.9 million. But the CIA rated IBM&#39;s proposal the riskier to pull off and gave Amazon higher ratings in technical and past performance categories, according to a GAO report that examined the competition.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The award quickly turned heads in the industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has &quot;arrived as a serious player, due to this award,&quot; said Shawn P. McCarthy, research director at IDC Government Insights. &quot;That will change things going forward.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">David Yang, an analyst with IBISWorld, said that Amazon Web Services has been known for its price and ease of use, but the CIA deal provided a way to significantly improve its reputation for security.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;That gives them the credibility to work with other major corporations,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The kudos, though, proved to be premature. IBM protested the award, and the GAO ultimately found merit in the complaint and recommended the CIA reopen the competition.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services then filed suit against the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a filing released last month, portions of which had been redacted to protect confidential information, Amazon argues that &quot;commercial cloud technologies have outpaced fixed Government IT counterparts.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon writes off IBM as &quot;a traditional fixed IT infrastructure provider and late entrant to the cloud computing market.&quot; The company has asked the court to prevent resubmission and reevaluation of proposals.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anne Altman, general manager of IBM&#39;s U.S. federal business, said in an interview last week that the company has been involved with cloud technologies for half a dozen years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I think it is unfair to say IBM hasn&#39;t been doing this,&quot; she said, noting that IBM has significant experience building clouds tailored for organizations and agencies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The CIA, which declined to comment on Amazon&#39;s legal actions, is moving forward with the new competition, and bids were due last month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;The selection process is ongoing, and the Agency remains focused on awarding a cloud contract for the Intelligence Community,&quot; Christopher White, a CIA spokesman, said in a statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: justify;">Amazon Web Services said in a statement that it believes &quot;strongly that the CIA got it right the first time.&quot; McCarthy said both companies have their strengths.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;You&#39;re talking about a company like Amazon, who was quick to the cloud, quick to be able to develop solutions that have gotten people&#39;s attention, including the federal government,&quot; he said. But &quot;don&#39;t write IBM off as being stodgy. They have reinvented themselves many times over the years.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:marjorie.censer@washpost.com">marjorie.censer@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130901e991002ut</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_014.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark22">CapitalBusiness</a><a name="bookmark23">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services opens its office in Herndon</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Marjorie Censer 567 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2 September 2013 The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL A09</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Gerald L. Gordon, who heads the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority, said the arrival of Amazon helps diversify the county beyond government contracting (although Amazon Web Services does a bit of that, too).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He cited the recent wins of Intelsat and Bechtel. &quot;That gives us footholds in different industries,&quot; Gordon said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jim Cheng, Virginia&#39;s secretary of commerce and trade, piled on, hailing the company&#39;s choice as a boon for the area. &quot;AWS is such a world-class company, and they could have gone anywhere,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the work isn&#39;t all done. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) joked that local officials are still seeking to lure Carlson herself. &quot;We&#39;re trying to get Teresa to move from Maryland,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is in the process of buying The Washington Post and Capital Business.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Obama administration last week issued a new rule that requires contractors to step up their efforts to hire people with disabilities, despite push back from companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under the rule, federal contractors must set a hiring goal that 7 percent of their employees be workers with disabilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Labor Department&#39;s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs has said the rule is necessary because the unemployment rate for workers with disabilities remains much higher than for those without. However, contractors have argued that complying with the rule will drive up their costs and that they will face challenges in asking employees to voluntarily identify whether they have disabilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alissa A. Horvitz, co-chairwoman of Littler Mendelson&#39;s office of federal contract compliance programs practice group, noted that the new rule does not take effect for 180 days.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;re giving companies six months to come into compliance, and I think that sends a message to the government contractor community that they did hear our concerns,&quot; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Government Accountability Office has denied a protest filed by McLean-based Science Applications International Corp. against a Navy contract awarded to Fairfax-based SRA International for IT services for the Military Sealift Command.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SAIC had proposed a cost of $65.1 million to SRA&#39;s proposed $56.5 million, but the Navy conducted what it called &quot;cost realism analyses&quot; and found that SAIC&#39;s proposal would likely cost $76.7 million and SRA&#39;s $74.4 million.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both received the same ratings in the technical, past performance and socioeconomic considerations categories.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SAIC refuted the evaluation, arguing that the Navy improperly adjusted the labor rates of its subcontractors and didn&#39;t hold discussions with the company. The GAO backed the Navy.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The GAO has also rejected a protest filed by Accokeek, Md.-based Beretta USA over the exclusion of its proposal in a Special Operations Command competition to provide precision sniper rifles, ammunition, accessories and replacement parts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The contracting officer has concluded that &quot;Beretta&#39;s offer was among those that had not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and that posed a high risk of unsuccessful performance.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">The GAO said it had no basis to question the decision.

Bezos has been in relentless pursuit of a lag-less future in which you barely have time to utter the word &quot;shipping&quot; before a package hits the doorstep. In this utopia, deliveries take place within hours, not days. To make it a reality, Bezos is bringing to bear the full power of Amazon&#39;s</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">supply-chain resources. The company has plowed $13.9 billion since 2010 into new warehouses near its customers. It&#39;s a massive undertaking, even for a multinational.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But a handful of smaller companies are convinced there&#39;s a way to get products to consumers just as quickly, with greater satisfaction and at a fraction of the cost. The future, they say, is in on-demand 3-D printing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These two methods of delivery couldn&#39;t be more different. One relies on scaling and infrastructure to cut transportation time. The other eliminates infrastructure and instead sinks money into materials and on-site manufacturing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It won&#39;t be long before these technologies start overlapping and interacting - and that&#39;s a good thing. The resulting combinations will iron out a lot of the inefficiencies of using either method alone. But however it happens, it probably won&#39;t be hailed as a &quot;3-D printing revolution&quot; or as a &quot;shipping revolution.&quot; This could be the just-in-time revolution.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is merely one of many businesses jockeying to see who can shave the most delay off their shipping options. EBay and Wal-Mart are testing same-day delivery. The competition to trim even a few hours is intense. To get deliveries to customers in under an hour, eBay dispatches college students by foot, bike and taxi to pick up products at big-box stores and drop them at people&#39;s doorsteps.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Faster shipping is costly. As a share of Amazon&#39;s total sales, shipping was nearly 5 percent in 2011, up from 3.2 percent in 2009. It&#39;s increasingly eating into Amazon&#39;s profit, and same-day delivery promises to exacerbate that trend.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is moving ahead anyway. By bundling same-day delivery with Amazon Prime - whose members pay $79 per year to receive free shipping and by some estimates spend up to twice as much as nonmembers - the company is likely to make up for any shipping-related shortfalls. Although it&#39;s hard to see a mom-and-pop store pulling off such a feat, Amazon has the means to use same-day shipping as a loss leader.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Same-day shipping raises the pressure on Amazon to have a more reliable inventory, lest an order come in and can&#39;t be fulfilled within 24 hours. (Bezos, Amazon&#39;s founder, has agreed to purchase The Washington Post in a deal expected to close this year.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Faster shipping also allows companies to produce a wider variety of products with less unsold inventory. When air shipping began to displace ocean freight in the mid-20th century, it cut weeks off of transportation times, enabling perishable goods to survive longer trips. That trend has accelerated with aircraft technology, says David Hummels, an economist at Purdue University in Indiana.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;If there is uncertainty in demand plus lags between production and final sales,&quot; Hummels wrote, &quot;firms may face a mismatch between what consumers want and what the firm has available to sell.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So the less time goods spend in transit during production and distribution, the more efficient companies can be at satisfying consumer demand. But what if companies could dispense with shipping altogether by &quot;manufacturing&quot; goods near their final destination?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s where 3-D printing comes in. By producing goods in the ordered configuration precisely when they&#39;re needed, 3-D printing is ideal for filling gaps in the supply chain (which reduces uncertainty), keeping inventory low (which saves companies money on shelving) and reducing waste (which occurs when the goods aren&#39;t sold).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Advocates for 3-D printing argue that the manufacturing technique could upend the retail sector. A small or nonexistent inventory gives a business much more freedom to test new products. Suppose you sold coffee cups that were manufactured only as people ordered them, said Hod Lipson, director of Cornell University&#39;s Creative Machines Lab. You could post a handful of options on your Web site at little to no cost to you, then just delete the low-performing cups.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;That would be very costly to do if you actually had to fill up a whole supply chain, a whole production line, for each of those items,&quot; Lipson said. &quot;But when you&#39;re printing them or fabricating them on demand, you can much more easily adapt your production.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The idea of most American entrepreneurs doing business this way is enticing. Alas, limits to just-in-time manufacturing make universal adoption unlikely.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One major hurdle is that printing with more than one material at once is difficult. A typical room might contain objects with 50 materials in various combinations. To print an object, not only would you need all the materials on hand in a printable form - you&#39;d also need a printer with multiple or interchangeable nozzles. And each new material might need to be printed under different conditions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DJ Butenschoen works for an Illinois-based company called GPI Prototype and Manufacturing. The company 3-D-prints metal parts by laying down a powder and then tracing a design with a laser before applying more powder and repeating the process, over and over. (All 3-D printing operates on the same principle.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;We have seven metals we build out of,&quot; Butenschoen said. Each one prints at its own rate. &quot;Sometimes it&#39;s how focused the laser is, is it quick, is it slow - so having the ability to put multiple metals in there, you&#39;d have to have multiple lasers and multiple everything. And then you&#39;re putting three or four machines together just to make one part.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The finishing process often demands the most attention. After all, even the simplest bobblehead is decorated before it&#39;s sold. That takes time and money, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GPI accepts orders from practically anyone, from hobbyists to large manufacturing firms that need complex moving parts. But - tellingly - GPI won&#39;t 3-D-print something if it can be machined using traditional methods.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You shouldn&#39;t try this at home. Squirting molten plastic from a tube might be fine, but steel or aluminum, with their higher melting points, are another story.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nobody, in other words, will be replicating whole cellphones and televisions at home anytime soon. Traditional manufacturing and stand-alone factories will endure. In time, they will incorporate 3-D printing, allowing more flexible manufacturing and shorter turnaround times.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The factory of the coming decade might wind up being a much smaller, community-oriented destination. 3-D printing is fast adopting the Kinko&#39;s model. UPS - yes, the company with &quot;parcel&quot; in its name - has announced plans to set up 3-D printing shops in San Diego. Washington&#39;s public library system has a 3-D printer for public use. And New York-based Shapeways accepts 3-D designs and prints them for you.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The last of those represents an early mix of traditional shipping and 3-D printing. &quot;Shapeways is taking the Amazon model,&quot; said Chris Dixon, the Andreessen Horowitz investor who sent Shapeways $30 million in venture capital this year. After it prints a customer&#39;s product from a 3-D design file, he said, UPS delivers it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shipping to U.S. locations takes two to three weeks. But when UPS opens its new 3-D printing centers nationwide, Shapeways could shrink that delay to the time it takes a person to visit a printing center, feed a copy-protected version of the design into the machine and print a product.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon&#39;s fulfillment centers could be another place where just-in-time manufacturing and delivery come together. Today, the company might be focused on getting things from its facilities to customers quickly. But that inventory</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">has to be restocked for the next customer. Using 3-D printers to replenish inventory locally could add up to a great deal of savings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even if home-based 3-D printing remains a niche activity, MakerBot chief executive Bre Pettis expects that within 18 months, most people will have held a 3-D-printed object.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The next big threshold is when everyone knows someone who has access to a 3-D printer,&quot; Pettis said. &quot;You&#39;ll be the person friends come to and say, &#39;Take me to your leader.&#39;ˆ&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20130901theswitch0901</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020130901e9910005f</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_016.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark26">-entertainment-books</a><a name="bookmark27">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Jesus is first subject of Amazon’s ‘Icons’ biography series</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Ron Charles 808 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">27 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last month, a clueless interview on a Fox News webcast made Reza Aslan&#39;s biography of Jesus a cause celebre. This month comes word of a less zealous take on the man from Galilee.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jay Parini&#39;s &quot;Jesus: The Human Face of God&quot; will be published in December as the first in a new series of trim biographies called &quot;Icons&quot; from Amazon Publishing. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos has agreed to purchase The Washington Post in a deal expected to close this year.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Parini is a poet and novelist who&#39;s also written well-regarded biographies of Robert Frost, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck. They&#39;re important figures, for sure, but nobody will threaten your life if you place them in a bad light. That&#39;s not the case with the central figure of Christianity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I wondered if I might be crazy to take on such a big subject,&quot; Parini said via e-mail from his home in Weybridge, Vt. &quot;My major concern, of course, was the obviously sensitive nature of the subject. Billions of people have put Jesus at the center of their lives. Who was I to write about him, not even being a clergyman or religious scholar? Then again, in my research for what I thought would be a novel about Jesus, I discovered that it was difficult to find a short, well-informed &#39;life&#39; that told the story in a straightforward manner with due respect to the subject and some degree of scholarly weight. In a sense, I wrote the book about Jesus that I wanted to read.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the very least, Parini won&#39;t suffer the kind of silly criticism that Aslan endured from Fox News for not being a Christian. His father was a Baptist minister. He grew up in a home infused with the Old and New testaments, and he&#39;s been a churchgoing Episcopalian throughout his adult life.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I think that the practice of religion allows one to discover emotional and psychological truth of a kind not available in the secular world,&quot; he said. &quot;I have a mystical bent, and I pursue daily meditations that follow the liturgical calendar — what are called the &#39;daily offices&#39; of the church. I am no literalist, but I have a strong sense of the value of Christian teachings and Christian practice, and I hope this informs my book on Jesus.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While expressing admiration for Aslan as a writer, Parini takes issue with Aslan&#39;s thesis in &quot;Zealot&quot; that Jesus was a &quot;politically conscious Jewish revolutionary&quot; who advocated overthrowing the Roman Empire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The core of the Jesus message is what has made him relevant for 20 centuries,&quot; Parini said. &quot;That message — embodied in the Sermon on the Mount — is one of passive resistance to violence. Turn the other cheek. It&#39;s the essence of Christianity. One has to cherry-pick a few odd remarks by Jesus, then read them out of context while ignoring the vast bulk of the Gospels to think Jesus was a zealot, and then — if he were — would anyone care about yet another violent rebel from Galilee, most of whom are now forgotten?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Aslan&#39;s Jesus is not mine,&quot; he said. &quot;I draw on the four Gospels and some of the Gnostic Gospels as well as centuries of biblical scholarship to offer a clear, simple picture of Jesus as a great ethical teacher and a religious genius, a man born on the Silk Road and able to draw on Western ideas about body and soul and Eastern ideas of karma and spirituality to create a major new synthesis — although always rooted in Judaism. My view is that Jesus never thought he would create a new religion. He offered, instead, his own modifications and extensions (and radical reinterpretations) of Judaic ideas.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Icons&quot; editor James Atlas has known Parini for more than 40 years. When he asked Parini to contribute to the upcoming series, Atlas assumed he&#39;d choose a literary figure like those he&#39;s written about before. But he said that his old friend surprised him: &quot;It emerged in the course of our discussions that while Jay and I had been</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">communing all these years about writers, he had been having a separate conversation on a higher level with this mysterious and compelling figure whose every word was literature.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Books in the &quot;Icons&quot; series will be released about every two months.

The new standard is set to go into effect in 2015.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In its report released Monday, the FHFA&#39;s inspector general called the timeline for implementation &quot;inordinately long.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The change in the accounting treatment of these delinquent loans potentially could require Fannie and Freddie, which have rebounded to enormous profitability in the past two years as the housing market recovered, to &quot;charge off billions of additional dollars related to loans,&quot; the report stated.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The inspector general&#39;s report, dated Aug. 2, called on the FHFA to require the firms to implement the new accounting changes at a faster pace and expressed concern that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not recognizing the potential losses in their public financial statements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized by the U.S. government in September 2008 as rising mortgage losses threatened them with insolvency. The mortgage companies have cost taxpayers almost $188 billion to stay afloat.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fannie Mae on Aug. 8 reported a $10.1 billion profit for the second quarter and said it would send a $10.2 billion payment to the Treasury for its federal aid. For the second quarter, Freddie Mac posted its second-largest quarterly profit, reporting net income of $5 billion, and said it would make a $4.4 billion dividend payment as part of the reimbursement for its rescue aid.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon.com, the Web site of the world&#39;s largest online retailer, went down for about 15 minutes Monday in a rare outage for many users across the United States and Canada.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was unclear what triggered the rare disruption.

Bezos&#39;s company, after all, is based on the Internet, which was created during the Cold War by a military research-and-development arm of the federal government, the Advanced Research Projects Agency.

No Internet, no Amazon, no $25 billion personal fortune for Jeff Bezos.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why am I writing about Bezos now? For exactly the reason you might suspect: because of his pending purchase of The Washington Post. Call me naive, if you like, but I think that if you&#39;re going to own a high-class journalistic enterprise like The Post, whose job is to call powerful forces to account, you should expect to be called to account yourself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But good luck trying to get that done when it comes to Bezos.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When I exposed the thesis of this column to Amazon, I couldn&#39;t even get a response, much less an interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Peter Elkind, a colleague of mine at Fortune magazine who spent months working on a must-read cover story called &quot;Amazon&#39;s (Not So Secret) War on Taxes&quot; (June 2013 issue), tried to talk to Bezos about his business and personal philosophies, he was stonewalled. That, of course, was before Bezos&#39;s deal to buy The Post surfaced.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you check the numerous articles about Bezos — including Fortune&#39;s 2012 businessperson-of-the-year story and the interviews that he&#39;s done — you see that he ducks and weaves when he&#39;s asked about libertarianism. But consider this anecdote, courtesy of Sheldon Kaphan, formerly Amazon&#39;s chief technology officer, and Bezos&#39;s first hire at the firm.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kaphan says he once heard Bezos say, &quot;If the government hadn&#39;t invented the Internet, private enterprise would have done it.&quot; Yeah, right, and defeated the Soviet Union, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Look. As long as Bezos was doing nothing but running Amazon, there wasn&#39;t much reason for people to care about his politics. I certainly didn&#39;t care about them. But when you&#39;re about to become a major force in the political life of Washington by buying a diminished but still immensely powerful outlet like The Post, that&#39;s a different story.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No matter what Bezos says now, once his purchase of The Post closes, scheduled for the fall, he&#39;s almost certain to begin imposing his standards and beliefs on The Post, or at least on its opinion pages.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For better or worse, that&#39;s what newspaper owners do — but I&#39;d at least like to hear from Bezos what his beliefs are and to have him reconcile the question of his being a libertarian who&#39;s benefited immensely from taxpayers&#39; R&amp;D money. A core belief of libertarianism is that ideas will prevail in a free marketplace. And if you know about markets, you know the key to making them efficient and fair is for as many players to have as much information as possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, I can&#39;t forget what happened after Rupert Murdoch bought the then-upscale New York Post from its liberal owner, Dorothy Schiff, in 1976. Murdoch assured the paper&#39;s staff that he&#39;d retain the Post&#39;s essential character as a serious newspaper. And we all know how that turned out.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Disclosure: I am a retiree of and own stock in The Washington Post Co., and The Post pays Fortune for the right to run my work.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:asloan@fortunemail.com">asloan@fortunemail.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Sloan is Fortune magazine&#39;s senior editor at large.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Buzz asked business leaders last week what they thought of the Graham family&#39;s decision to sell The Washington Post (and Capital Business) to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. Here&#39;s some of what they said:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Running The Post following the Graham family is a tough assignment. Nonetheless, I can&#39;t think of a better leader than Jeff Bezos. The Grahams did everything that they could to think and invest for the long term, but as a private company, The Post under Bezos will have time to reinvent itself outside the scrutiny that all public companies face. Mr. Bezos brings many important attributes to this assignment: He is a lover of information, wickedly smart, a highly successful business leader and, based on his letter to the employees, savvy about the legacy that he has inherited.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The Post needs to find a way to fix its cost structure. It can do this by reducing cost or increasing revenue. I expect Jeff to invent and invest his way into growing the business. I am sure that the new Post will learn from many things that Jeff did well at Amazon: Focus on the customer, deliver customized information and generally increase the reader&#39;s awareness of and perceived brand value of The Post and its offerings. &quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-Ralph Terkowitz, partner at ABS Capital Partners and former Washington Post chief technology officer and founder of washingtonpost.com</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">* * *</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Jeff Bezos is all about using innovative technology to satisfy customers. It could be the perfect solution to the challenges facing The Post,&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-chief executive of the Carlyle Group</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">* * *</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I can understand a natural instinct to try and find somebody else to take on the burden after a while. And I think Jeff Bezos is somebody who will be able to do that and will probably strengthen the paper on many levels because he simply will be able to afford it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Since I think Washington desperately needs a newspaper like The Washington Post, I&#39;m looking forward to the possibility that not only will he maintain it, but he will provide it with additional resources to augment it. Now, as somebody said, &#39;That is something devoutly to be wished.&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It will remain to be seen. We know he has the interest in it and the resources for it, and he ain&#39;t stupid. So I wish him well.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of U.S. News &amp; World Report, the New York Daily News and executive chairman of Boston Properties</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">* * *</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I have known Jeff for nearly 20 years, from the days when e-commerce was an idea, not yet a business, and he was getting Amazon off the ground. I have watched with admiration as Jeff has built Amazon into the global</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-commerce leader by adopting a patient, built-to-last approach.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Filling the shoes of the Graham family, who have served this community well for nearly a century, will not be easy, but I know Jeff is up to the challenge. He will be a great owner, marrying a keen appreciation for journalism with a deep understanding of the digital future.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-Steve Case, chairman and chief executive of Revolution and co-founder of America Online</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">* * *</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The very word newspaper is confining. Newspapers that think they are in the newspaper business will fail. They are in the entertainment and information business. All involved should welcome Jeff. I am certain he will bring new ideas on which we can all build to an exciting future. Amazon has taught him the enduring value of great content, and he saw an opportunity to acquire some and took it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-Bill Raduchel, technology veteran and consultant to the Daily Mail and General Trust PLC, one of the largest media conglomerates in the United Kingdom</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">* * *</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I am a huge fan of The Post. I still receive the daily paper delivered to my home. But the economics of publishing certainly no longer make sense with the current model. Jeff Bezos has demonstrated innovative thinking … and, perhaps more importantly, action. It&#39;s time to try something new and hopefully he will be the guy who can implement the changes necessary for The Post to flourish for the next 100 years. &quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-Early-stage investor Cal Simmons, whose portfolio includes Parature, burger chain Five Guys and hospitality site Five Star Alliance</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In other news ...</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The largest piece of art in any of Marriott International&#39;s 3,880 properties worldwide is now being installed in the Washington Marriott Marquis, the 1,175-room hotel that opens next May across from the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in downtown Washington. The first phase of the installation — it&#39;s that big! — was dropped by crane into the atrium of the hotel a few days ago, where it will be bolted into the ground. The &quot;Birth of the American Flag,&quot; as the sculpture is called, was made by Baltimore artist Rodney Carroll, with input from J.W. &quot;Bill&quot; Marriott Jr., chairman of the Bethesda-based hospitality company. The giant sculpture is 56 feet high and weighs 27,000 pounds — more than 13 tons — and is by far the artist&#39;s largest project. The installation is being done in phases and finishes later this month. This is Carroll&#39;s first commission for Marriott, and includes other artwork for the hotel. The sculptor perforated the steel at the base of the artwork to create a &quot;star&quot; effect of the original 13 colonies. The steel bands have been curved to make it look like the &quot;flag&quot; is waving in a breeze.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Factoid of the Week</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$3.2BThat&#39;s the value of The Washington Post Co.-owned Cable One cable company. The Washington Post Co.&#39;s decision to sell its flagship newspaper for $250 million means the corporate parent keeps its far more valuable assets, including education, cable TV and broadcast television units, in a publicly held firm that will be renamed after the sale to Jeff Bezos closes later this quarter. The estimate is based on Cable One&#39;s recent subscriber estimates and using the average private market value per subscriber of $5,550, which is in line with what the larger deals have fetched so far this year, according to Kagan media analyst Justin Nielson.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:thomas.heath@washpost.com">thomas.heath@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130812e98c000s1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_020.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark34">Thomas Heath</a><a name="bookmark35">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">-business-economy</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Value Added: The Leonsis prescription for The Washington Post’s success; Technologist/entrepreneur/sports mogul offers his thoughts on Bezos’s aquisition of the newspaper</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,294 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I spent the better part of an hour last week talking to a technologist/ entrepreneur who bought an iconic Washington business from one of the city&#39;s leading families.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That would be Ted Leonsis, a former AOL executive and now owner of Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, which owns the Washington Wizards and Capitals, as well as the Verizon Center.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leonsis may be — along with his friend and former AOL business partner Steve Case — the closest thing Washington has to Jeff Bezos. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, is personally buying The Washington Post for $250 million from the family led by Donald E. Graham.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leonsis, 56, has just come off what appears to be a successful turnaround at Groupon, the Chicago-based daily-deals company at which he served as co-chief executive since February and was named chairman this</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">month. Earlier this year, he launched Monumental Network, which includes an array of sports, cultural and news content built around his sports empire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He has experience in buying legacy family businesses. He bought the teams and arena from the deceased sports mogul Abe Pollin, and he went about shaking up the organization.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So I called him to ask for his thoughts on The Post&#39;s sale, as well as the sale of eight broadcasting stations by Allbritton Communications, another big, family-owned media empire in Washington. Allbritton was sold to Sinclair Broadcast Group for $985 million two weeks ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leonsis talked about the changes occurring in media and the challenges that go with marrying a public trust, whether it&#39;s a hockey team or a newspaper, with the necessities of business — and what to expect from Bezos.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Both the Graham and the Allbritton sales, Leonsis said, &quot;are the natural outcome of the change in media.&quot; &quot;You have the Allbritton family capitalizing on the peak of the television business. They got a really, really good</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">price. Robert Allbritton, who really understands new consumers, felt it would be in the best interest of the family to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">make that sale and then repurpose those dollars into new media enterprises like Politico, which, ironically, The Washington Post should have done,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">&quot;The newspaper business, as presently configured, cannot grow.&quot; So it is going to have to change.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;And hopefully, it will change for the better. Today, newspapers are still the most personality-, human-driven of all media enterprises. At Google, Amazon, Groupon — name the company — machines do the heavy lifting.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Algorithms get smarter and better every day.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Take Amazon, he said. &quot;Their algorithms are smarter today than they were yesterday, because more people used the service than the day before. And the more usage, the smarter the algorithm and the more tuned the service is to the consumer. And the easier it is to precisely target to make money.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those clicks, whether we like it or not, increasingly will influence editorial decisions.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They have to,&quot; he said, &quot;because each person is an individual. Through their click streams and where they spend time, they are deciding and voting&quot; on what they want to read.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos and Amazon have mastered that data intelligence.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;One of the reasons Amazon became so successful is that they have the widest choice of information. You, as a consumer, feel comfortable that anything you want to buy, you can get on Amazon. And Amazon says, &#39;If you like this, then you are going to like that.&#39; &quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leonsis recounted a personal experience he had with Amazon after reading an obituary in the New York Times on author Iris Chang.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I went to Amazon to buy the book she wrote called &#39;The Rape of Nanking.&#39; And Amazon said, &#39;If you like this, you will like these.&#39; &quot; He promptly bought two more books on Nanking, which led him to produce a documentary film on the event. That, in turn, led to his founding of an online movie business, SnagFilms.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The move to digital won&#39;t be cheap.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What Amazon does with search &quot;takes time, effort and money,&quot; Leonsis said. &quot;And it&#39;s risky. And you really can only do that as a private company, because a public company wants consistency and growth, quarter to quarter.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To turn The Post into a 21st-century platform like Amazon, &quot;you might have to take steps back and invest and lose more money short-term in order to find more users and to make the algorithm smarter.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That could mean not charging for content, learning more about which subjects draw the greatest interest (known as cohorts), and figuring out how to grow those areas and build advertising &quot;verticals&quot; to appeal to the people on the other end of those clicks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Politico is bringing together a large group involved in politics, and they&#39;ve opened up a whole new category of advertising. Maybe The Washington Post ends up with 10 big verticals . . . being a Politico competitor and an ESPN competitor and a Comcast SportsNet competitor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s also going to have to move rapidly into video. Video is the killer app on the Web, and you are in print. I&#39;m sure the next generation of Washington Post will be filled with video.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In fact, The Post just opened up a big video operation and invested heavily in employees and equipment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;You&#39;ve got to be much more adept in mobile and real-time delivery of news,&quot; he said. &quot;That will take investment and infrastructure build-out.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I changed the subject a bit and asked Leonsis about the challenges of buying a family-owned business. Although The Washington Post Co. is publicly traded, the Grahams control the majority of the voting shares.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You have to convince the seller that &quot;I&#39;m going to take our baby and invest in it and accentuate all of the positives that you built — and then add value from my skill set so that it can thrive in the new world,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;That&#39;s the outcome that Don Graham and Abe Pollin wanted.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Taking old cultures and fusing them with the digital world isn&#39;t easy, however.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;ve owned the teams for 14 years. It took me 12 years to get the organization to realize that we were an</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-commerce platform and media company and social media company. Oh, and yes, we also own sports teams.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;A lot of it is generational. The leagues have been around a long, long time. The Washington Post is going to bring in people from new media and younger people who grew up on the Net and don&#39;t read newspapers. My son, Zach, has never read the physical paper. He reads articles of interest to him. He tweets. His vocabulary is different.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is hard to implement change, even when you own the enterprise.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;A lot of things that need to be done seem to be unnatural acts for longtime employees&quot; at legacy companies, Leonsis said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the Wizards and Capitals migrated to the efficiency of paperless ticketing last year, &quot;there was dramatic angst internally. We almost had to force the decision.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos shelled out $250 million for The Washington Post and affiliated publications, but the deal announced last week is hardly the Internet billionaire&#39;s first foray into Washington&#39;s business community.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As an individual, investor and chief executive, Bezos has connections to the local technology, government contracting, lobbying and, now, media sectors. Although each of these roles is technically separate, they all run through Washington and back to Bezos.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among his more recent business interests is Georgetown-based EverFi, which provides online tutorials that supplement school curricula. The start-up collected $10 million last year from a roster of investors that included Bezos Expeditions, Bezos&#39;s personal investment fund, as well as Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Twitter co-founder Evan Williams.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Their approach with us has been they&#39;re very hands-off on the operations of the business,&quot; said EverFi chief executive Tom Davidson. &quot;Having said that, they&#39;re very detail-oriented when we do . . . seek their counsel on our strategic moves or other operating issues we might have.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Melinda Lewison, managing director at Bezos Expeditions, declined to comment on the firm&#39;s investment and management strategy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Davidson said Bezos takes a long-term view of a company&#39;s potential for success, a fact that makes him an ideal investor as the young firm expands into the often-challenging public education market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;At EverFi, we really want to build a storied institution, and every move that he has seemingly ever made in his business has been about building an institution,&quot; Davidson said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EverFi is just one of Bezos&#39;s connections to the local technology sector. Amazon owns 29 percent of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">District-based daily-deal purveyor LivingSocial after sinking hundreds of millions of dollars into the firm since late 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tige Savage has represented the Revolution investment firm on LivingSocial&#39;s board since the company&#39;s earliest days. Amazon&#39;s interest in the company and subsequent investments helped establish LivingSocial as a dominant player at a time &quot;when everyone was jumping into the daily deals business.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;In the e-commerce world there&#39;s no better company to keep than Amazon,&quot; Savage said. &quot;We thought that could be an item that differentiated us from the pack and make it a one-two horse race in the daily-deals space between Groupon and LivingSocial.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Indeed, money from Amazon and other deep-pocketed investors fueled LivingSocial&#39;s meteoric rise. The company used those millions to add subscribers across the United States and snap up similar daily-deals companies around the globe.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the deal had one complicating factor: Amazon had plans to launch a service called Amazon Local that would also offer steep discounts at restaurants, spas and retail outlets. LivingSocial helped Amazon establish the business, Savage said, but the potential for conflict of interest was obvious.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;There have been some complicated times related to that in terms of being in cooperation and competition with a partner, but I think both the folks at LivingSocial and Amazon did their best to navigate through that,&quot; Savage said. &quot;It was never perfect, but we didn&#39;t think it was going to be perfect.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since taking a stake in LivingSocial, Amazon&#39;s quarterly regulatory filings have offered the best insight into the local company&#39;s otherwise private finances. It has lost money in the past year and a half as some of its acquisitions lost value and new lines of business failed to yield significant revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Savage declined to comment on LivingSocial&#39;s business performance. But as the firm has looked to expand beyond daily deals, Amazon has been active in every board meeting, represented by vice president of worldwide corporate development Peter Krawiec, as well as in discussions between meetings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;ve been quite vocal and brought to bear a lot of experience as we&#39;ve looked to expand beyond what was just the daily-deals space into a broader social commerce platform,&quot; Savage said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Tim O&#39;Shaughnessy, the chief executive of LivingSocial, is the son-in-law of Washington Post Co. Chairman Donald E. Graham.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps Amazon&#39;s most aggressive move in Washington involved its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, a company that sells cloud computing technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2010, the company lured Teresa Carlson away from Microsoft&#39;s federal business to lead its public-sector group.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;She stepped almost into a start-up,&quot; said Glenn C. Hazard, chief executive of Herndon-based cybersecurity company Xceedium, which has partnered with AWS. &quot;Amazon is a very large company [but] AWS, when she joined, this was a new foray into this market,&quot; he said. &quot;They chose somebody that had the credibility, understood the market.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2011, AWS rolled out GovCloud, a cluster of data centers available only to government agencies and contractors. This year, AWS was approved for a program that fast-tracks companies approved to sell cloud computing services to government agencies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shawn P. McCarthy, research director at IDC Government Insights, said AWS&#39;s focus on the federal market was clear in its fierce pursuit of a recent contract with the CIA. (After Amazon won, competitor IBM successfully protested the decision with the Government Accountability Office, and Amazon has since filed a lawsuit.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The federal government market &quot;takes some time, it takes some effort,&quot; McCarthy said. &quot;It&#39;s only worth making that effort if you&#39;re going to go after it aggressively.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This month, AWS is set to celebrate the grand opening of its expanded Herndon office. In May, state officials said the office would be home to 500 employees who would support the company&#39;s commercial and government businesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It also maintains &quot;a significant and growing data center infrastructure investment in Virginia,&quot; an AWS spokeswoman said, though she would not provide specifics on the number of data centers in the area or how many people they employ.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon also lobbies lawmakers in Washington on a number of issues, including online sales taxes and patent reform. The company counts 25 registered lobbyists in Washington, most of whom are at outside firms. The company spent $2.5 million on lobbying in 2012, a figure that has more than doubled from a decade ago.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the first half of the year, the retailer spent $1.7 million to lobby Congress and executive agencies, and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$660,000 of the sum went to outside firms. Lobbying powerhouse Patton Boggs, where heavyweight Tommy Boggs Jr. and former senators John Breaux and Trent Lott are listed among the retailer&#39;s Capitol Hill advocates, received the biggest chunk of Amazon&#39;s business, earning $370,000 so far in 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:marjorie.censer@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">steven.overly@washpost.com </a>marjorie.censer@washpost.com Catherine Ho contributed to this report.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130811e98b002mi</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_022.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark38">Metro</a><a name="bookmark39">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Why would Bezos sustain The Post&#39;s local coverage?

All Rights Reserved Reprinted from Thursday&#39;s editions</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As you might have heard this week, we at The Post are excited about the prospect that our soon-to-be new owner, Amazon.com billionaire Jeff Bezos, will rescue our business with bundles of money and world-class tech savvy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the Graham family&#39;s surprise decision to sell the paper also aroused concerns in the region that the new owner, based in Seattle, would eventually weaken The Post&#39;s longtime commitment to in-depth coverage of local affairs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s certainly a risk. For someone like Bezos, who built Amazon into a global Internet retail powerhouse, there has to be a temptation to focus primarily on a similar national and international mission for The Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Any resulting drop in intensity of local coverage would be a tremendous loss for our region - and not just for local columnists whose self-interest is rather blatantly at stake here.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To cite just a pair of examples: The Post&#39;s commitment to local investigative reporting led to exposure of major scandals currently implicating the Democratic mayor of the District (campaign finance) and the Republican governor of Virginia (suspicious gifts and loans).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The Post is a national paper, yes, but its importance to local and regional coverage should not be underestimated by the new owner,&quot; said Chuck Bean, executive director of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fortunately, there are plenty of reasons to believe that Bezos will stick to the Grahams&#39; longtime strategy of maintaining a strong focus on local affairs. Basically, it&#39;s where the money is.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos is certainly aware that the paper continues to reap a large majority of its revenue from the local market, especially via the print edition.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s partly because we, like other newspapers, make much more money from print ads than online ads. And only people in the D.C. area get the print edition.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Moreover, as Post Co. Chairman Don Graham stressed for years, why go head-to-head against bigger rivals in the national online market when we can milk our dominant position in what is arguably the world&#39;s richest, most influential local market?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even in the future, when everybody reads the paper in cyberspace, it should make good marketing sense to preserve (and improve) our connection with Washington area residents. Sure, the New York Times or Huffington Post can give you national coverage, but we&#39;ll tell you about your commute and schools as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos has said virtually nothing about his intentions. But his letter to Post employees seemed to emphasize local concerns.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Our touchstone will be readers, understanding what they care about - government, local leaders, restaurant openings, scout troops, businesses, charities, governors, sports - and working backwards from there,&quot; he wrote.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can hardly give up on local coverage and still focus on restaurant openings and Scout troops. If that statement&#39;s any guide, we can expect Bezos to increase attention to local coverage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That would be a welcome switch. Budget pressures have forced The Post to trim reporting staff and space in the paper for local news in recent years even though we remain the region&#39;s paper of record.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No matter what he does, Bezos&#39;s arrival means a change in style at the top. There&#39;s no getting around the fact that he lacks the Grahams&#39; ties to our area.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Don Graham once walked a police beat in the District, just for the sake of the experience. He&#39;s a civic pillar in the classical style, quietly supporting local educational philanthropies and other virtuous institutions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Post Publisher Katharine Weymouth, Don&#39;s niece, grew up in Manhattan but has made a point of arranging lunches and otherwise reaching out to local politicians and regional leaders since she took over her current position.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She remains publisher but presumably with diminished clout once the sale is complete.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bezos has already said he&#39;s staying in Seattle to focus on what he called his &quot;day job&quot; running Amazon. It&#39;s hard to imagine him showing the same level of interest as Don in who will be the next school superintendent in Prince George&#39;s County.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">D.C. Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), told the Washington Business Journal he was sorry to lose the personal connection with Post ownership.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;I&#39;m very sad to see another local institution pass out of local hands. These local institutions - you knew the owners, saw them in restaurants, saw them at the ballgame,&quot; Evans said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That era is slipping away, but we needn&#39;t necessarily fear what replaces it. If Bezos can do for local coverage online what he did for book buying - not to mention save our finances - then The Post&#39;s connection with the regional audience could end up stronger than before.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20130811mccartney0808</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020130811e98b0006d</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_023.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark40">Business</a><a name="bookmark41">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Now a newsman, too: Bezos buys The Post</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,209 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11 August 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL G02</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Bezos, whose entrepreneurship has made him one of the world&#39;s richest men, will pay $250 million in cash for The Post and affiliated publications to The Washington Post Co. Seattle-based Amazon will have no role in the purchase; Bezos will become its sole owner when the sale is completed, probably within 60 days. The Post Co. will change its name and continue as a publicly traded company without the newspaper. &quot;The Post could have survived under the company&#39;s ownership and been profitable for the foreseeable future,&quot; Don Graham said. &quot;But we wanted to do more than survive.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Novelist Ann Patchett isn&#39;t a big fan of Jeff Bezos or Amazon. But she hopes the billionaire will be good for The Washington Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When I open my front door and look across the street, I&#39;m looking at the front door of Alan and Nancy Saturn&#39;s house. No matter how much time passes, it&#39;s always going to be their house. It was, for nearly 30 years, a neighborhood institution - the best parties, the best conversations, the best food. The Saturns&#39; front door stayed open, high notes of opera wafting out over the flower beds, interesting people milling around in the driveway, their three beautiful daughters coming and going, and later the beautiful grandchildren. But everything ends. Alan died in 2009, Nancy in 2010. By that time the daughters had moved away. And then the house was on the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For those of us in the neighborhood, the house kept its sheen, as if the light of the Saturns still occupied the rooms. But the furniture, the fabulous artwork, all of Nancy&#39;s shoes - they were packed up and carted away. The house didn&#39;t sell. A housesitter was installed. She thought she heard burglars in the attic, but no one robs a house from the attic. Then a wave of fleas swept down the stairs. The possums, which had infested the third floor when the house sat empty, were infested themselves.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There was a Sunday afternoon when I stood on the sidewalk with a neighbor and we contemplated buying the place ourselves, fixing it up. It had been on the market too long. But the next day it sold and freed us from our good intentions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new owners could never live up to our expectations. They were not the one thing we needed them to be, which was the Saturns. But the yearning of the neighbors for what we had lost was the least of their problems. They couldn&#39;t move in. It turned out the smart addition that had been built many years before had no actual foundation, and the downspouts drained under the house. Half the wiring was still knob-and-tube, and the other half was rigged, and when the electricians came to rip it all out, the third floor caught fire. I stood at my bedroom window and watched the fire trucks close the street.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Which is not to say that The Washington Post has been operating with faulty wiring or that a greatly respected family is the cause of disrepair. It is to say that taking over an institution that is venerable, essential, beloved and failing is a thankless task and a substantial risk, and that maybe I should thank my new neighbors for saving the house even as they changed it. And maybe we&#39;ll have Jeff Bezos to thank for saving The Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I realize that I&#39;m extending optimism and goodwill without knowing Bezos&#39;s vision for the paper. I also realize that optimism and goodwill toward Bezos may seem a little strange coming from me, a spokesperson for independent bookstores and someone who is forever climbing up on a chair to rail against Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Karen Hayes and I opened Parnassus Books in Nashville in November 2011, it wasn&#39;t because I was dying to go into retail. I already had a job, as Bezos already has a job. But I believed in bookstores and their importance to writers and communities. Physical bookstores and all they represent are worth saving as far as I&#39;m concerned, and so I got out my checkbook.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Everyone said I had to be an idiot for opening a bookstore in the age of Amazon and e-readers, but I was never deterred. I was in it for love, not logic. And since the only thing dumber than buying a bookstore is buying a newspaper, I have to imagine that Bezos must care about the fate of newspapers in general, and about the jewel that is The Post in particular. Otherwise he could have just as easily bought a football team.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos has been a forceful visionary, an industry leader and often a steamroller. While I disagree fiercely with many of Amazon&#39;s business practices, I regard Bezos as a man who makes things work.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And speaking of making things work, that bookstore we opened is doing really well in spite of Amazon, as I hope The Post will do well under its new owner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All we can ever really count on in life is change, but still, what we like is what we know, and for the most part we would be glad if those things didn&#39;t change at all. The only people worthy of living in the Saturns&#39; house were the Saturns&#39; daughters, but they had lives of their own. As for The Post, it seems that it should always belong to the Grahams, and so we are grateful that Katharine Weymouth is staying on as publisher.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No one gets to tell the billionaires how to spend their money, though I imagine everyone tries. Personally, I think vaccinations, education, newspapers and a theater in Lincoln Center aren&#39;t bad choices. The billionaires aren&#39;t as nervous as the rest of us; they can afford to take their time, wait things out. Or as Orson Welles explains it in &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; a movie in which he plays a fictionalized version of a real-life newspaper baron (an easy comparison, I know, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to let it pass): &quot;You&#39;re right, I did lose a million dollars last year. I expect to lose a million dollars this year. I expect to lose a million dollars next year. You know, Mr.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thatcher, at the rate of a million dollars a year, I&#39;ll have to close this place in . . . 60 years.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is indisputable that there is a golden age behind The Post, but who&#39;s to say what&#39;s up ahead? The estimated</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$25 billion of Bezos&#39;s personal wealth could buy a long life for a newspaper.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And since it&#39;s safe to assume that Bezos is reading The Post thoroughly these days, let me offer a piece of advice that will benefit us both: Expand the book review offerings. Nothing beats newspaper reviews for selling books.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And bookselling, after all, is one of the businesses we&#39;re both in.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Ann Patchett&#39;s next novel, &quot;This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage,&quot; will be published in November.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tricia Duryee is a former staff writer at AllThingsD, where she covered e-commerce, including Amazon.</p><ol id="l3"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos is destroying independent booksellers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over two decades, Amazon has transformed how people buy books. At first, that meant low prices, resulting in readers buying more books online than at corner stores or big-box retailers. More recently, it has also meant distributing e-books to electronic devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But it&#39;s hard to make the case that Amazon was solely responsible for destroying independent booksellers. That trend was largely underway before Amazon was founded in 1995. The year before, Barnes &amp; Noble and the Borders Group captured nearly a quarter of all revenue from book sales. Of course, since then, those</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mega-retailers have struggled, too, as Amazon has led a shift from print books to digital.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s success in the book industry can largely be attributed to its expansive catalog and its willingness to slash prices. Such cost-cutting measures were recently backed up by a federal court, which found Apple guilty of colluding with publishers to increase e-book prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon maintains that it does more good than harm. At a news conference last year, it said Kindle owners buy far more books - not just digital but also print - than they did before owning a Kindle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And given the company&#39;s massive scale, some authors and booksellers have chosen to partner with Amazon rather than fight it. Independent authors can self-publish titles in return for sharing 30 percent of the revenue with Amazon. In 2012, the company said, 23 of those authors each sold more than 250,000 copies of their books, and more than 500 self-published books made Kindle&#39;s top-100 bestseller lists worldwide. Through Amazon&#39;s</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">third-party fulfillment services, independent booksellers can sell their wares through a massive online channel for a cut of the revenue. In 2011, consumer purchases from 2 million independent sellers of all sizes made up nearly 40 percent of Amazon transactions.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s biggest competitors are other big retailers such as Wal-Mart.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is the largest retailer on the Web, with tens of millions of items for sale. That makes it a competitor to Wal-Mart, Target and other Main Street retailers. However, Bezos has his sights set on a much broader swath of competitors, including Apple and Google.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All three companies are racing to build empires that include hardware, software and services. They each want to be the go-to company for movies, books, music and other content.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the hardware front, Amazon is best known for its e-readers, but in the past year it has entered the tablet market, with its Kindle Fire competing with Apple&#39;s iPad. It also is rumored to be working on a cellphone to rival the iPhone and Google&#39;s Android. And it is offering a Netflix-like streaming video service and producing original TV series.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But potentially, its most under-the-radar businesses include Amazon Web Services, which lets consumer brands - such as Reddit, Foursquare, Pinterest and Netflix - rent infrastructure from Amazon rather than maintain their own hardware. Between Amazon&#39;s interest in providing third-party Web services - and the massive amount of information it garners from its customers&#39; spending habits - Amazon is more of a data company than a retailer.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Bezos doesn&#39;t know the ways of Washington.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In his letter to Post employees on Monday, Bezos attempted to dispel concerns that he is buying the newspaper to use as a platform for his personal agenda. &quot;The paper&#39;s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners,&quot; he wrote.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although he lives thousands of miles away, Bezos is no stranger to Washington politics - Amazon has a large lobbying presence here. Last year, the company spent $2.5 million to influence Congress and the executive branch. That&#39;s slightly more than Apple, which spent $2.3 million, but less than other tech giants such as Google and Facebook. Amazon has been active on a number of issues, from online wine sales to cybersecurity, postal reform, free-trade agreements and broadband service - with its biggest priorities being state sales tax reform and antitrust concerns related to e-book pricing. While Bezos plans to remain in the other Washington, he&#39;s already heavily invested in Beltway politics.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s key advantage is that it doesn&#39;t collect state sales taxes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many believe that Amazon&#39;s successes stem from not having to pay sales tax in many states, giving it a price advantage over local retailers. Amazon says it is not opposed to the collection of sales tax - as long as there&#39;s a simple, national system that is applied to all sellers, no matter their business model, location or level of sales.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With that caveat, it has supported the Marketplace Fairness Act, passed by the Senate this year. The act would give states the authority to collect sales tax online, as long as they have simplified their tax laws.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That hasn&#39;t kept critics from being skeptical of Amazon&#39;s intentions. Ahead of a legal obligation to collect sales tax, the company has secured sweetheart deals in some states: In return for opening fulfillment centers, which create thousands of jobs, states have given Amazon a grace period in which it doesn&#39;t have to collect tax. Having a local presence typically means it must do so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, there&#39;s no overwhelming evidence that collecting taxes has negatively affected the retailer&#39;s sales in those states. In fact, more than half its revenue comes from jurisdictions where it collects sales tax.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Bezos doesn&#39;t care what Wall Street thinks.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This mantra is repeated every time Amazon releases disappointing quarterly results. Despite the company&#39;s profit roller coaster, Bezos doesn&#39;t appear on conference calls with analysts to seek forgiveness.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But don&#39;t confuse his lack of kowtowing with nonchalance about the bottom line. When I interviewed Bezos in September, he told me: &quot;Take a deep breath and be patient. Deep yoga breaths, people!&quot; Every new business inside Amazon takes five to seven years to become profitable, he claims.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Take the long-term view, and the interests of customers and shareholders align,&quot; Bezos wrote in a letter to shareholders last year. Investors are still waiting for that alignment to be consistent. Last year, Amazon reported a loss of $39 million; it earned a profit of $631 million in 2011.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With Bezos&#39;s ownership of The Post, the tables will be turned. If he abides by those same beliefs as an owner, he will have to be the patient one, believing that aggressive investments today will return gains over the next decade. For The Post&#39;s customers - in this case, readers - it could translate into new innovation and products that stress quality service over short-term profits. At least, one can hope.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Tricia Duryee is a former staff writer at AllThingsD, where she covered e-commerce, including Amazon.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Don Graham&#39;s grandfather, Eugene Meyer, bought The Washington Post in 1933. Graham&#39;s mother, Katharine Graham, led it to greatness in the 1960s and &#39;70s. He was publisher from 1979 to 2000. Today, he leads The Washington Post Co., and his niece, Katharine Weymouth, is publisher of the paper. Last week, Graham announced that he is selling The Washington Post to Amazon&#39;s Jeff Bezos.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We spoke Tuesday morning about how the sale came about and what it means for the future of the paper the Graham family built. A lightly edited transcript:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s begin at the beginning. What made you decide to sell The Washington Post?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m the chairman of the board of The Washington Post Co. - the soon-to-be renamed Washington Post Co. - which owns four large businesses, one of which is the newspaper it&#39;s named for. I came to work for The Post as a reporter in January 1971. I&#39;ve worked in the company for the last 42 years. And I never until this year even imagined the possibility that we might think about selling.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But at the end of last year, as we do at the end of every year, Katharine Weymouth, who&#39;s the publisher of The Post and my niece, and I sat down to look at how 2012 had gone and what we could forecast about the next three years; 2013 we knew was probably going to be the seventh year in a row of declining revenues and, particularly, declining print advertising revenues. Looking at the trends, our response to declining revenues has always been to try and innovate. Wonkblog is an example of that. We&#39;ve had a lot of successful innovation at The Washington Post. But the innovations, though very high quality, weren&#39;t offsetting the decline in revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As we looked ahead, if revenues kept declining we&#39;d have no choice but to keep cutting. Roughly 85 percent of stock in the Post Co. is owned by shareholders not in the Graham family. So the money we&#39;re losing isn&#39;t our own. We didn&#39;t feel good about that. Still, we were quite certain that The Post could survive and have a long future, but we wanted to do more than survive. We wanted to be successful and expanding and financially strong. So for the first time in either of our lives we asked ourselves if we thought our small public company was still the best place for the newspaper. We didn&#39;t at that time make the decision to sell, but we made a decision to think about it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How did the process work? Paul Farhi reported that you spoke to at least a half-dozen buyers. Can you tell me anything about them?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are a number of ways in which people sell businesses. We did not, as is sometimes the case, hold an auction where you take bids from any prospective buyer. Our aim was to see if there was a buyer who could give shareholders a fair deal and make The Post newspaper stronger in some way. We spoke with fewer than a dozen corporations and individuals - not all of whom were in tech.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos was always a particularly intriguing possibility, but I was surprised when he expressed an initial interest because Jeff is famously, single-mindedly focused on Amazon. He had two conversations with Allen &amp; Co., the firm we were working with on the sale, and then those conversations ceased, and I assumed he&#39;d decided he had no interest. But instead he e-mailed me less than a month ago and asked if we could get together. We did, twice, we spent more than three hours talking over the course of those meetings, and at the end of those meetings, he told me he was interested and serious and quickly sent a team to explore our financials, and we arrived at an agreement pretty quickly.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tell me a bit about your relationship with Bezos prior to this deal. How did you meet him?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve known him for 15 years. My memory is we were introduced by Katharine Graham, who&#39;d met him at various conferences. She had always wanted to know great technology people. She knew Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and Andy Grove at Intel was a very close friend of hers. We both liked the same things about Jeff. He&#39;s direct and decent, very smart and funny. And you have to be impressed by the business he built, the way they take care of their customers, and the way the technology and everything at Amazon has gotten better and better.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most of our conversations between then and now were me asking him for advice about news and technology. When he was starting the Kindle, he invited me and a few other people from The Post out to Seattle. I was very impressed again because, typical of the businesses Jeff runs, he lost a lot of money starting the Kindle, and it wasn&#39;t clear it would be a success. But, of course, it was a huge success.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tell me about those conversations. What are Bezos&#39;s thoughts on the media? What kind of news consumer is he?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are a few things I&#39;ve learned in the past two weeks. When Jeff holds meetings at Amazon, he asks people not to use PowerPoints but to write an essay about their product or program or what the meeting is to be about. For the first 10 or 15 minutes, everyone sits and reads the essay. His point is that if you write at length, you have to think first, and he feels the quality of thought you have to do to write at length is greater than the quality of thought to put a PowerPoint together. He also says that to get to know people he calls daylong meetings about books where everyone reads the same book and talks about it. So he&#39;s a reader.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The quality of his thought and advice to me over the past few years is reflected in the memo he wrote to the staff. His philosophy is to try things. Try things and experiment, and if it doesn&#39;t work, try more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Does Bezos come in knowing where he wants to take The Post and what kind of changes he wants to make, or is he buying the institution and figuring out what to do with it later?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You should ask him, but what he says in the memo that he wrote - and he&#39;s an absolutely truthful man - is that it&#39;s the latter. He&#39;s a very good businessman and technologist, but not a magician. He doesn&#39;t come in knowing how to fix things. But he comes in knowing how he&#39;d think about fixing things. One of the biggest things he brings is, if you&#39;re Jeff Bezos, you know lots and lots of technologists. He knows a lot of people and what they&#39;re good at, and my guess will be he&#39;ll identify the problems and think about who should work on them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What about local news? You&#39;ve always emphasized that The Post is first and foremost a local paper. Your family has deep roots in this city. Bezos doesn&#39;t live here and isn&#39;t planning to move. How will that emphasis change?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He doesn&#39;t live here, but he&#39;s a businessman. And he&#39;ll quickly see the importance of local news, local revenue and local readers to this business. He understands the vast majority of our revenues will come from print. Print will get a lot of his attention. Eugene Meyer, my grandfather, bought the paper in 1933 and had zero experience in the newspaper business when he bought it. But his ownership turned out to be very good for The Post, and I hope Jeff&#39;s will be as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos runs a massive company that has a direct stake in much of the legislation that runs through this town. It cares deeply about sales taxes and Internet regulation and international trade, to name just a few. Amazon already spends millions of dollars lobbying. Now Bezos will own a newspaper with a lot of influence in Washington. How will those interests remain separate?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yes, I spoke to him about that at considerable length. He is buying The Post for the right reasons. He is not buying it, as he said in his memo, echoing my grandfather, to serve the private interests of its owner. We did talk over that, and I have every confidence in Jeff&#39;s approach.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos is buying The Washington Post and some of the company&#39;s other papers, like Express and El Tiempo Latino. But he&#39;s not buying Slate or Foreign Policy or The Root. Why aren&#39;t they in the deal?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, Slate and Foreign Policy and The Root are unrelated businesses. What he bought are related businesses. Since you are in New York, you are missing the most delightful reaction to the purchase, which is in the Express. It says, &quot;Bezos buys Express!&quot; And then in parentheses, it says, &quot;(and the Washington Post, too).&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So he bought The Post and other businesses closely related to The Post. Express and El Tiempo Latino are printed on our presses. Slate and The Post have always helped each other, but there hasn&#39;t been that kind of relationship. And the Post Co., once renamed, is very happy to continue as their owner.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What advice have you given to Bezos? What would you have liked to try in recent years if you had his kinds of resources?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve left most of my cards on the table. Jeff has nothing to learn from me other than what I don&#39;t have to teach him: respect for The Post. And if you read what he wrote yesterday, his respect can&#39;t be clearer. He knows this is a hard problem. This could be the most exciting problem. Our people and the ideas Jeff and his people will bring - it&#39;s easy for me to overpromise on his behalf, of course, but it will be fun. This will be the most exciting newsroom anywhere. Tell your friends to begin sending their rÃ©sumÃ©s to [Executive Editor] Marty [Baron] and Katharine. It&#39;s going to be a great place.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20130811ezrasunbiz0811</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020130811e98b0000k</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_027.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark48">Petula Dvorak</a><a name="bookmark49">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">-local</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let’s talk about Bezos and the booksellers; The book industry has changed in nearly every single American town primarily because of Amazon.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">935 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I know, here&#39;s another Postie weighing in on this week&#39;s sale of the paper to Amazon owner Jeff Bezos. The Louisiana Purchase has received less ink — in 210 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But, please, if you can, be patient with me, and let&#39;s use the newspaper&#39;s sale this week to revisit an industry that has changed in nearly every single American town primarily because of Bezos: the independent bookstore.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There aren&#39;t many left in the District. We have Politics and Prose, Kramerbooks &amp; Afterwords and a few used-book stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We&#39;ve watched so many die in the past few years. Each closed for different reasons, but all said at least part of the problem had to do with the one-click ease (and super-low prices) of Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the survivors, Politics and Prose, was bought two years ago by Bradley Graham (no relation to Washington Post Co. chairman and chief executive Don Graham) and Lissa Muscatine, journalists who met at The Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Graham and Muscatine had faith in the idea that an independent bookstore had a higher purpose, that it was a place of civic discourse, idea sharing and discovery. Graham&#39;s family has a business background, and after years of high-profile Washington reporting, and lots of time as a major political speechwriter for Muscatine, they were ready for a change.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And a challenge, apparently.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Constantly hounded by the competition, their bookstore in Northwest Washington is nevertheless thriving. But now, this. Their old paper — and the source of many of their author talks — has been swallowed by the Bezos vision.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;It&#39;s so complicated for us,&quot; Muscatine said when I caught her in the fiction section and asked for her reaction to this week&#39;s announcement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bradley Graham is also conflicted. &quot;We trust Don&#39;s judgment,&quot; he told me. &quot;But . . .&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two years into the world of independent booksellers, the former Posties have a new perspective.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We fervently want to believe that the Graham family&#39;s decision to sell the paper to Bezos is a smart business move that will, as supporters of the deal contend, breathe new life into the Post and enable it to prosper during the digital age,&quot; Graham and Muscatine wrote on their Politics and Prose blog.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Yeah, that&#39;s pretty much how we all feel. It is clear that the dead-tree-and-ink delivery system of news is dying. What we need is a new model.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most everyone involved is all for innovation. And book people get it. Who wouldn&#39;t want to order something at night and have it show up the next day, said Oren Teicher, head of the American Booksellers Association.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re not against competition. It&#39;s what American business is all about,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Politics and Prose has online ordering, complete with the Pavlovian and familiar &quot;ADD TO CART&quot; button.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And behold, in the middle of the store&#39;s fiction section is Opus, which looks kind of like a Jetsons Gutenberg press, a machine that instantly prints and binds any online work, particularly the works of new and unpublished authors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the American book culture is changed by innovation, if the crack of a spine and the smell of new — or old — pages don&#39;t hang on when everyone has digital tablets, that&#39;s fine. Game over, the book people say.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;But in the past two years, as stewards of another local cultural institution — Politics and Prose — we&#39;ve routinely encountered a different version of Bezos,&quot; Graham and Muscatine went on to write.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Indeed, among many independent booksellers he is perceived as a ruthless competitor bent on disrupting traditional retailers, including bookstores, without regard for the civic and commercial value that local bricks-and-mortar establishments still bring to neighborhoods around the country,&quot; they said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And it doesn&#39;t make it any easier that part of the Politics and Prose trademark — their author readings — is often done by Washington Post authors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;No, we won&#39;t stop hosting Post authors,&quot; Graham said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It goes both ways. Graham&#39;s two books are sold on Amazon and are available on Kindle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The thing that has booksellers most agitated about Amazon&#39;s model is the unfair price advantage the company has because it avoids sales tax in some states and gets selective tax breaks at warehouses across the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Indie booksellers went ballistic over President Obama&#39;s recent visit to an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga, Tenn.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;For you to highlight Amazon as a job creator strikes us as greatly misguided,&quot; wrote Teicher and the book association board in an open letter to the president. &quot;As you&#39;ve noted so often, small businesses are the engines of the economy. When a small business fails and closes its doors, this has a ripple effect at both a local and a national level.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Teicher said Amazon just uses cheaper books as loss leaders to lure customers into making bigger purchases on the site, marginalizing books and killing book culture.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said he has never, ever, bought anything from Amazon. I have. Lots. Just yesterday, I ordered a scooter part, bath gel and a Greek mythology book.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Graham and Muscatine see a silver lining.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps Bezos will accept their invitation to go to Politics and Prose, to hear one of his new employees do a reading in a brick-and-mortar building. With no bath gel involved.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:petula.dvorak@washpost.com">petula.dvorak@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">To read previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak.

Hoop-jumping.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Craig Timberg;Jia Lynn Yang 1,496 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the relentlessly efficient world of Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon employees quickly learn when they have overtaxed the attention of their chief executive. He quietly pulls out his smartphone and starts replying to e-mails. In extreme cases, Bezos will walk out.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This demanding style is as much a signature of the Amazon.com founder as his famously long-term approach to developing new products or services, say people who have worked with the man who this week agreed to buyThe Washington Post for $250million. Bezos (pronounced &quot;BAY-zohs&quot;) has developed a precise and inventive approach to management that has powered Amazon to the top ranks of U.S. technology companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He favors a nimble, loosely organized company in which &quot;two-pizza teams&quot; execute important corporate tasks, because a work group requiring three pizzas over a lunch meeting is inherently too cumbersome. And he often requires employees pitching new ideas to write mock news releases for their product&#39;s imagined launch, a way of focusing their minds on what will most excite customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Annual salaries at Amazon are modest by the standards of the technology industry, with compensation weighted toward lucrative stock benefits designed to instill a sense of ownership and long-term purpose among employees. The key is measurable performance. His management team produces what some have called ruthless annual evaluations; top performers get larger stock benefits while laggards sometimes face pointed suggestions that they find new jobs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;One thing I learned is when you got a meeting with him, you&#39;d better be ready,&quot; said Nadia Shouraboura, who until recently worked on Amazon&#39;s senior executive team reporting directly to Bezos. &quot;He will figure out something you haven&#39;t thought of. If you haven&#39;t thought through exactly how to delight our customer, that&#39;s a bad thing.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is an outwardly genial side to Bezos, 49, a father of four who has an outsize laugh and appears to revel in the salesmanship of a product launch as he strides the stage in jeans and a dress shirt. But inside is a drive for perfection, manifested by an unwillingness to waste time or energy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The recruiting motto: &quot;Work hard, have fun, make history.&quot; Or, as Bezos put it in his first letter to shareholders, in 1997, &quot;It&#39;s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, &#39;You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can&#39;t choose two out of three&#39;).&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kal Raman, a former top Amazon executive who is now chief operating officer for Groupon, recalled the consuming sense of mission instilled by Bezos. &quot;When you try to rewrite history, it doesn&#39;t come without blood, sweat, tears and sacrifice. He doesn&#39;t hold you to any standard he doesn&#39;t hold to himself.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In describing Bezos, the most common comparison is to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who was single-minded in his devotion to every new product. But while Jobs, who died in 2011, is often described as a design visionary, capable of discerning what consumers one day will want, Bezos has focused on delivering whatever they currently desire — as quickly as possible. Delays are not accidents or misfortunes but &quot;defects&quot; to be eradicated, he has said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The result is a company that has become among the world&#39;s most powerful retailers, a leader in the burgeoning world of cloud computing systems and a player in a range of other businesses — book publishing, television production, electronics manufacturing.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos, who founded Amazon in his Seattle area home in 1995, meanwhile has become one of the country&#39;s wealthiest men, with an estimated $25billion in assets and plaudits from Time, Harvard Business Review and legendary investor Warren Buffett, who has hailed Bezos as &quot;the ablest CEO in America,&quot; according to Washington Post Co. chief executive Donald E. Graham.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos has no patience for bureaucracy, and employees are encouraged to put a stop to anything that smacks of jumping through hoops. A rule requiring that employees who brought their dogs to work sign in the animals disappeared soon after complaints.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos also disdains the formality of job titles, encouraging employees to work outside the scope of their titles if it helps the company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the most coveted honors at Amazon is the &quot;Just Do It&quot; award, given to an employee every couple of months who strays from his or her job title to do something that will help Amazon. Bezos helps choose the employee himself and then hands the award — an old Nike shoe — to the winner at a company-wide event.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those who win the award proudly hang the shoes in their cubicles; in the online directory, a small icon is placed next to the names of those who win.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It was not the title but rather who&#39;s got the best idea,&quot; said John Rossman, who worked at Amazon from 2002 to 2005 as an executive and is now managing director at Alvarez &amp; Marsal, a consulting firm. &quot;Who&#39;s bringing the solution to the table? That&#39;s what was most important.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What is not clear, even to some of those who have worked for Bezos, is how his management style translates into running a newspaper amid a historic decline in readership and revenue that has afflicted the entire industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos has said little about his plans for The Post since the sale was announced Monday, though in a letter to employees he made clear his desire to accelerate the pace of innovation at a company that for years has struggled amid the same digital transition that made online companies such as Amazon rich. The company, which will have no ownership stake in The Post, declined to comment for this story.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The Internet is transforming almost every element of the news business: shortening news cycles, eroding long-reliable revenue sources, and enabling new kinds of competition, some of which bear little or no</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">news-gathering costs,&quot; Bezos wrote. &quot;There is no map, and charting a path ahead will not be easy. We will need to invent, which means we will need to experiment.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos encouraged a culture of experimentation at Amazon, where failure is accepted so long as it yields new lessons.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Most things at Amazon are viewed as an experiment,&quot; said Jason Crawford, who worked at Amazon as a development manager from 2004 to 2007. &quot;And that means a few things: You don&#39;t assume it&#39;s going to work before you try it, but that&#39;s also okay. The goal is try things. We&#39;re going to measure them and find out if they work.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon was a pioneer of the now common practice at tech companies such as Facebook — testing different versions of the company&#39;s Web site with different audiences to see what works, Crawford said. Half the users might see a new feature, while the others do not. Amazon employees would then measure the results to see if the features encouraged people to buy more or stay longer on the site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bezos has said that he intends to keep his focus on Amazon and keep his home in the Seattle area rather than becoming a fixture in Washington, as four generations of The Post&#39;s outgoing owners, the Graham family, have been.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos also has agreed to keep the newspaper&#39;s top executives in place, though they may need to work without a popular corporate management tool: PowerPoint presentations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos all but banned such presentations at Amazon around the time Edward Tufte, a computer science professor at Yale, wrote an essay saying that their bullet points encouraged lazy thinking. Amazon employees are required to write papers, known as &quot;narratives,&quot; that are no longer than six pages.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The idea for Bezos, former employees say, is that the act of writing forces people to focus their thoughts and think them through. Bezos&#39;s faith in the enduring power of words is evident in his own annual letters to shareholders.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His letter in 1997 is regarded as something of a founding document for Amazon, highlighting his obsession over serving customers and developing plans that take years to bring to fruition.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That consistent long-term view — he often talks of seven-year cycles for executing business plans — is the counterpoint to his minute-by-minute quest to avoid wasting time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Jeff has always been very efficient,&quot; said Jason Kilar, who worked at Amazon from 1997 to 2006, rising to the level of senior vice president. &quot;There is one very important thing he knows is not in abundant supply on Earth, and that is minutes.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">But he added: &quot;He has the patience to invest if he believes the strategy is the right one.&quot; </a><a href="mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com" target="_blank">craig.timberg@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:jialynn.yang@washpost.com">jialynn.yang@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130808e9880002t</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_029.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark52">ezra-klein</a><a name="bookmark53">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon nearly destroyed local bookstores. It may do the same with online art sites.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Lydia DePillis 523 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yesterday, Amazon.com expanded into yet another market (no, not newspapers): art. After a few months of courting gallerists, the Amazon Art marketplace launched with more than 40,000 works, a few of which aren&#39;t coming from the bargain basement: a $1.45 million Monet, for example, and Norman Rockwell&#39;s &quot;Willie Gillis: Package From Home &quot; for $4.85 million. All in one click, with free shipping!</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The seller of both those pieces is New Orleans-based M.S. Rau Antiques, which says it&#39;s the largest art retailer in North America. It has its very own online catalogue, and as much name recognition as you get in the world of fine collectibles. So why join the Amazon marketplace, when it takes a commission of between 5 and 20 percent on each sale? Can they charge more to make up for it?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;A lot of our pieces have slight wiggle room in them,&quot; says owner Bill Rau. &quot;All that means is that they&#39;ll be a little bit less. American Express charges 3 percent today, so let&#39;s face it, there&#39;s a savings right there.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Talking to Rau, it becomes clear that Amazon doesn&#39;t threaten brick and mortar galleries — all of which can also drive sales on the site — as much as it does the smaller online art marketplaces, like Artsy, Artnet and Artquid. Having a gigantic reach makes an online sales platform much more valuable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They sort of stand above anybody,&quot; Rau says. &quot;There&#39;s a number of well-designed places, but it&#39;s the newspaper equivalent of The Washington Post. These other guys have a neighborhood pamphlet that they put out in a grocery store.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sure, a gallery might be represented on another site as well. But if it&#39;s getting most of its sales through Amazon anyway, it might figure it&#39;s just not worth the trouble — and if Amazon wants to compete even more ruthlessly, it can lower its commissions (Artnet charges 15 percent, and Artsy charges between 10 and 15 percent). In that way, this market is different from books, which publishers want to place in as many storefronts as possible. For a piece of art, there can be only one point of sale.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tyler Cowen points out that Ebay&#39;s auctions are valuable for a buyer, and that a sticker-price site might not work well for the high-end stuff. But there&#39;s nothing to prevent Amazon from developing an auction capability in the future. And if the price is really too high, a prospective buyer could go around Amazon and ask the seller for a lower price--visibility might trump the pricing mechanism in this case.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Discussion, though, is still valuable. Amazon may end up buying Artsy for its commenting platform and its &quot;genome&quot; tool for categorizing different works, just like it bought Goodreads for a center of chatter around the things it sells. Which might mean you can have your gigantic, relatively transparent, consolidated art market — and your cozy community as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130807e9870063i</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_030.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark54">-politics</a><a name="bookmark55">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As its business grows, so does Amazon’s D.C. lobbying presence; The Internet giant has sharply increased its lobbying presence as its business interests have mushroomed.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Holly Yeager;Carol D. Leonnig 1,082 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has sharply increased its Washington presence in recent years, more than doubling what it spends to influence Congress and the executive branch over the past seven years as the Internet giant&#39;s business lines and interests mushroomed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That spending, which reached $2.5million in 2012 and is on track to surpass that amount this year, includes retainers paid to six outside firms that seek to affect policy on a broad array of issues, including tax reform, Internet security, cloud computing and shipping. Among the company&#39;s high-profile lobbyists are former Senate majority leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), former senator John Breaux (D-La.) and Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., chairman and a senior partner at Patton Boggs .</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, with Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos&#39;s planned purchase of The Washington Post, his company&#39;s profile in the capital is set to rise even further.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos sought to preempt concerns about his ownership of the paper, telling Post employees in a letter Monday, &quot;The paper&#39;s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company that Bezos built has much at stake in Washington, and high on Amazon&#39;s list is the sales tax on Internet commerce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a result of a pair of Supreme Court rulings, states can require out-of-state retailers to collect sales taxes from residents only if the companies have a physical presence in the state.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For years, Amazon fought efforts by states where it does not have such a presence to collect sales taxes on its transactions. But as it has built distribution warehouses across the country, the company has become a leading proponent of a bill that would allow all states to collect sales taxes from online retailers. The measure, known as the Marketplace Fairness Act, was approved by the Senate in the spring and is awaiting action in the House.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They want a level playing field,&quot; said Michael Mazerov, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who studies state tax issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has also hired leading tax lobbyists to prepare for what could be a broad overhaul of the tax code. Of greatest concern to the company, said Edward D. Kleinbard, who served as chief of staff of Congress&#39;s Joint Committee on Taxation, is any change to the way the United States deals with the foreign income of U.S. companies. Companies do not pay U.S. taxes on income earned by foreign subsidiaries unless it is returned to the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Companies are very concerned that they will be sold down the river by other multinationals with different priorities, so people hire a lot of lobbyists and try to make sure they&#39;re not the ox that gets gored,&quot; said Kleinbard, who teaches at the University of Southern California&#39;s law school.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company&#39;s recent lobbying efforts, detailed in disclosure reports filed with the Senate, show that its in-house lobbying arm is dealing with a wide variety of issues, including online wine sales, cybersecurity, postal reform, free-trade agreements and broadband service. Like many tech companies, Amazon has backed efforts at the Federal Communications Commission to expand broadband access.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The company&#39;s lobbyists have also been active on the issue of cloud computing. Amazon has been fighting for a contract with the CIA that analysts say would cement the company&#39;s bona fides in the federal contracting field.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the past three years, Amazon has quickly expanded its presence in cloud computing with its Amazon Web Services unit, winning clients such as NASA, Samsung, Pfizer and the Public Broadcasting Service. This spring, the CIA chose the company for a $600million cloud computing contract.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IBM, which had offered to do the job at a lower price, objected to the agency&#39;s decision, according to a review by the Government Accountability Office. IBM said that the CIA had unfairly changed some of the contract specifications in the middle of the process. The GAO agreed with IBM&#39;s main contention and in June urged the CIA to restart the contracting negotiations with its modified requirements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;In response to the GAO decision, the CIA has taken corrective action and remains focused on awarding a cloud contract for the intelligence community,&quot; agency spokesman Todd Ebitz said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two weeks ago, Amazon sued in Washington, asking a federal court to approve its contract with the CIA.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ken Doctor, a news industry analyst, said in a blog post there was a &quot;big downside&quot; to the owner of Amazon also owning The Post, because the Internet company has interests in several &quot;big political issues.&quot; He wrote, &quot;Amazon needs more friends in D.C., and it&#39;s hard to imagine what&#39;s better than owning the editorial page of the Washington Post in that quest.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment for this article.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the political front, the company is far from a heavy hitter. Its corporate political action committee donated</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$179,000 to federal candidates in the 2012 election cycle, and without a clear partisan pattern. It gave more to Republicans in House campaigns and far more to Democrats in Senate races. It gave $189,000 in the 2010 midterm congressional election cycle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By comparison, Google&#39;s political action committee donated $881,000 and Microsoft&#39;s PAC donated more than</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$1million in the 2012 elections.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s increased spending on lobbying is similar to the spending pattern of many tech companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2005, it was spending $920,000 on lobbying but had ratcheted that up to $2.5million by last year. This year, the company is on track to break its record. For the first half of the year, Amazon&#39;s lobbying spending is just over</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$1.7million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is also active in the Internet Association, which the firm launched with Facebook, Google, Yahoo and other Internet companies last year to help fight new regulations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;As a founding member of the Internet Association, Amazon is an industry leader helping educate policymakers about the powerful and rapidly growing Internet economy,&quot; said Michael Beckerman, the association&#39;s chief executive. &quot;Decisions made in Washington matter.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This week, I came to understand the many employees who&#39;ve experienced dread when their companies are sold. The Washington Post is being taken over by Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">After hearing the news during a company meeting, the first thing I did was call my husband. &quot;Honey, you won&#39;t believe . . .&quot; I started.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I didn&#39;t get a chance to finish my sentence. He already knew about the sale because The Post app on his iPhone had sent him a news alert. The irony wasn&#39;t lost on me, because one of the reasons The Post and other venerable newspaper publishing companies are having financially challenging times is the rapid way news is now disseminated electronically.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Good thing we are Amazon Prime members,&quot; my husband joked, referring to the fact that we are longtime customers who saw the value in paying for extra benefits with Amazon, which isn&#39;t involved in the sale. We have so many Kindle products that when I call with a problem it takes a few minutes for customer service to figure out which one I need help with.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A friend trying to encourage me about the sale e-mailed: &quot;Bezos is innovative. Look to him to look for ways to package and market content.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonetheless, soon after the shock that my company — protected and run by the Graham family for eight decades</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">— was being sold, I switched to my personal-finance mode.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What would this mean for my job and, most important, my pension?</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/" class="a" target="_blank">I wasn&#39;t as scared as I could have been because I always plan carefully. Earlier this year, as I&#39;ve been doing regularly as I get closer to retirement (although I&#39;m a good 10 years away), I calculated my possible retirement earnings. I went online and got my annual Social Security statement, which if you haven&#39;t done, you should (</a>www.socialsecurity.gov<span class="p">). It used to be that you received your statement in the mail about three months before your birthday. But in a cost-cutting move, the Social Security Administration stopped the automatic mailing of statements, except in a few situations.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I reviewed my most recent 401(k) statements to see whether I needed to adjust how I was investing my money. Was I too aggressive for the time I have left to work? Did I need to make any changes? I answered no to both questions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, I ordered my pension statement, which outlined how much I can expect to get monthly in retirement as a longtime Post employee (20 years this year). I&#39;m fortunate enough to have a traditional pension plan, although I&#39;ve never let that lull me into financial complacency. I still aggressively invest through my 401(k) retirement plan. After all, we&#39;ve seen far too often that pension promises can be broken.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos has agreed to provide comparable health and retirement benefits to employees once the sale closes. Employees&#39; pensions will continue to vest.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I decided to read more about the pension assurance by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission Web site. Under &quot;filings,&quot; I searched the EDGAR database, which is where you can find the documents that companies are required to file. I first viewed two documents — the letter of agreement for the sale and the company&#39;s Form</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8-K, which is used to inform investors and the SEC of any significant events.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under &quot;employee matters&quot; in the sale agreement, Bezos would get cash in an amount (or other assets, as mutually agreed) equal to the sum of the projected benefit obligation as determined using the same assumptions used in The Post&#39;s annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended Dec. 31. I then looked at the annual statement, where I saw that we&#39;ve got a well-managed, overfunded pension plan, which I hope stays that way under Bezos&#39;s leadership.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I don&#39;t know Bezos. I know the Grahams. I have always appreciated the personable nature of Donald E. Graham, Post Co. chairman and chief executive. As kindred penny pinchers, we share stories about being frugal. I admire Post Publisher Katharine Weymouth, who is also the mother of three. We often trade stories of the pressures of having a demanding job and making sure we have quality time with our kids. Thankfully, she is staying in her job.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Post has provided me with my livelihood for the past 20years. Although I&#39;ve had opportunities to leave, I&#39;ve stayed even when more money and stock options were on the table. I just kept remembering what my grandmother Big Mama used to say: &quot;Stick with what you know.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, like so many other employees, what we know keeps changing. If you aren&#39;t forced to change jobs, the company changes hands.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="mailto:singletarym@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">Readers may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or </a>singletarym@washpost.com.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">What do old Apollo program engines, newspapers and ticking clocks have in common? Jeff Bezos.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yes, Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos is buying The Washington Post for $250 million — a small fraction of the billionaire&#39;s net worth. It is not a dream, although many in the news business may have pinched themselves this morning just to make sure. They may have even done so again, shortly before lunch. That&#39;s how big this story is — or at least, was. The news cycle, after all, moves faster than it used to.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Amazon jokes are coming in at more of a trickle than the torrential downpour that followed Monday&#39;s breaking news. A BuzzFeed list has been compiled, showing the sale price of The Post relative to other high-profile media, tech and pro sports deals. No story is complete in today&#39;s news business without at least one listicle, after all.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In other words, the world is getting close to having wrapped its head around the idea that one of the most storied news publications is owned by a man who runs a company that sells everything from air mattresses and bunsen burners to yardsticks and zumba fitness DVDs and invests in such fresh-faced companies as Uber, Makerbot and Airbnb.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The nature of Bezos&#39;s professional success and investments, which are being discussed ad nauseam, bring up two things: one predictable — the other perhaps not so much. First, there&#39;s the deluge of Bezos-as-innovator headlines. In coverage of the sale, Bezos has been described as a &quot;relentless business innovator&quot;, &quot;an innovator who reinvents old industries,&quot; &quot;one of America&#39;s great innovators,&quot; and &quot;definitely a capitalist and very much an innovator&quot;. And that&#39;s just coverage and commentary from the publication Bezos has agreed to buy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A headline in The Seattle Times screams &quot;Innovator meets icon,&quot; and another on Bloomberg solemnly declares: &quot;Bezos the Innovator Is What News Business Needs.&quot; Another headline from the Globe and Mail in Canada declares, &quot;Bezos and the Washington Post: Another chance to innovate.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even Bob Woodward, famous for, along with colleague Carl Bernstein, reporting one of the most groundbreaking stories in journalism history (for The Post, of course), praised Bezos as an &quot;innovator&quot; even as he said &quot;we need a renaissance in reporting.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The response to the news that the founder of Amazon has bought The Washington Post could be summed up as follows: Save us Jeff Bezos, you&#39;re our only hope. Or, better yet: Use the innovation force, Jeff.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This may sound glib on its face, but the mythology inherent to &quot;Star Wars&quot; is apt here. Because, talk of &quot;a long time ago&quot; brings us to the second thing: the most interesting and profound aspects of Bezos&#39;s career, for me at least, are not the founding of Amazon, as transformational as the company has been, or his startup investments. It&#39;s his willingness to go to the bottom of the Atlantic (not the publication, the ocean) and retrieve artifacts that NASA and the Smithsonian had no plans to claim. Couple that with the fact he did so because, as a 5-year old, he and many others were, as he writes, so inspired by NASA and he wanted to give the next generation a chance to experience that same inspiration. Then there&#39;s the 10,000-year clock, which Bezos has said is meant to be &quot;a symbol, an icon for long-term thinking.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the news business could use anyone, it&#39;s someone who — more than being an innovator — thinks in long timelines with a healthy dose of nostalgia. A healthy (okay, very healthy) bank account doesn&#39;t hurt either.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Often, when talking about innovation, particularly in today&#39;s Internet-accelerated world, speed is paramount. &quot;Fail fast and fail often,&quot; the saying goes. But real, transformative change isn&#39;t always about speed (Amazon didn&#39;t turn a profit until its ninth year). More often than not, it&#39;s about patience — about tuning out the ticking clock, trudging into a swamp and diligently working away until you are ready to emerge better, stronger and faster than everyone else.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even now, the headlines of the Bezos-Washington Post buy are fading, reduced from a blazing two-column holler to a mumbling blurb on the publication&#39;s homepage. But the real work of innovation in news — the work that could take up a nice chunk of the ticks and tocks of that 10,000-year clock — is still only just beginning.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: justify;">Good thing Bezos seems to like old things and long waits.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, the initial shockwave of The Post&#39;s sale has passed, and we still don&#39;t have much to go on in trying to figure out what comes next. Here&#39;s a relevant question, though: On the theory that the paper is a business concern for Jeff Bezos even though he bought it with his own money, what has Amazon done with acquisitions in the past?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has long grown through accretion, after all, spending billions of dollars over the years on bits and pieces of the online retail universe as it builds towards total domination. The logic behind the acquisitions isn&#39;t always immediately clear, but they do tend to fall into a few categories. Here are the main things that end up happening to the businesses Amazon buys:</p><ul id="l4"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not much. There&#39;s a whole constellation of retail sites that Amazon has bought and essentially allowed to continue operating as is, with little to no Amazon branding, and sometimes even with overlapping and competitive business models. Case in point: Zappos.com, which founder Tony Hsieh has run almost completely independently since Amazon purchased the shoe marketplace in 2009 (though they&#39;ve since found some efficiencies through merging warehouses). There&#39;s also Shopbop, which is evolving on its own to sell designer clothes, Quidsi&#39;s Daipers.com, the cloth store Fabric.com, and the digital photography review site dpreview.com. And then there&#39;s Brilliance Audio, which seems to overlap both with Amazon Publishing and Audible.com, another recent purchase that&#39;s building its own partnerships.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So what&#39;s the strategy here? Amazon could want these properties just to keep them out of other big companies&#39; hands, or it could believe that they&#39;ll innovate better with their original founders. Finally, it may figure there are communities that will identify more with the &quot;independent&quot; brands than Amazon itself.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They become pages within Amazonia. That&#39;s what happened to the fashion site Endless.com, the early social networking site PlanetAll.com and the book search site Bibliofind.com.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They get killed outright. Musicfile.com and Accept.com, acquired in 1999, no longer exist in their original form. It&#39;s likely that Amazon took whatever patents or data they had and made use of them somehow. And then there&#39;s the acqui-hire, when companies are bought for their founders and then powered down, like what happened with the education startup Teachtree.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They expand Amazon&#39;s reach around the world. Bookpages and Telebook, acquired in 1998, became the company&#39;s British and German outlets. Junglee.com is basically Amazon&#39;s Indian version, and Joyo.com became Amazon.cn after Amazon bought it in 1994 for $75 million.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They build out some piece of the Amazon supply chain for digital and physical goods. Take LexCycle, which made an application that allows e-readers to download books in multiple formats; Ivona, which makes voice recognition software that could be used in Kindles; and Booksurge, the company which Amazon required</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">print-on-demand sellers to use until it was sued for anti-competitive behavior (it now operates under the name Createspace). Most recently, Amazon paid $775 million for Kiva Systems, which makes robots for stocking warehouses — a good way to deal with pesky labor problems at its burgeoning network of fulfillment centers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, neither Bezos nor Amazon has acquired a standalone journalism outlet yet, so it&#39;s unclear what&#39;s in the cards for The Post. But it&#39;s pretty certain that the paper will fit into Amazon&#39;s overall strategy in one or more of those general ways.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130806e986004h6</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_034.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark62">blogpost</a><a name="bookmark63">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Chinese state media fooled by satirical story on Washington Post sale</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Max Fisher 267 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The announcement that Amazon chief Jeff Bezos had purchased The Washington Post surprised a lot of people, but it appears that the folks over at China&#39;s ever-serious state media were so taken aback by the news that they briefly lost the ability to differentiate satire from reality. On Thursday, the state-run Xinhua news agency translated into Chinese a heavily satirical story from NewYorker.com on the sale, running it as fact. The story was dutifully re-reported by People&#39;s Daily Online and other Chinese media outlets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The original article, by comedian Andy Borowitz, is titled &quot;Amazon Founder Says He Clicked On Washington Post By Mistake&quot; and included a series of gag references that will be familiar to anyone who ever purchased something online, which is relatively common for urban middle-class Chinese.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of early this morning, the story was still up on Xinhua, as well as People&#39;s Daily Online and China News. The ever-sharp China blog Shanghaiist, which first reported the mix-up, captured a screen shot just in case Xinhua wises up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is not the first time that Chinese official media have reported a highly satirical American news story as fact. (Satire might be popular among Chinese citizens, but apparently not in the editorial offices of state newspapers.) In November, People&#39;s Daily Online breathlessly reported, as fact, a story in the Onion declaring North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to be &quot;the sexiest man alive&quot; and &quot;every woman&#39;s dream come true.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130808e988002jq</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_035.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark64">ezra-klein</a><a name="bookmark65">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Wonkbook: Is the Fed going to taper in September?</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Evan Soltas 3,144 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said he would not rule out the possibility that the Fed could start tapering as early as next month In a separate interview with Market News International, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Dennis P. Lockhart, also indicated a September move was an option.

That is lowest level since October 2009.&quot; The Associated Press.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SEC&#39;s hunt for financial wrongdoing loses steam. &quot;Officials at the SEC, which has taken enforcement action stemming from the crisis against 157 firms and individuals, aim to complete the vast majority of such cases by the end of this year, according to people close to the agency. Despite filing a near-record number of enforcement actions in the year ended Sept. 30, the SEC has been dogged by criticism by some lawmakers and investor advocates for a perceived shortage of big-name victories. One reason the enforcement push is winding down: the fast-approaching five-year anniversary of the meltdown. A statute-of-limitations legal cutoff generally restricts the sanctions the SEC can get for conduct that is more than five years old, unless the agency has &quot;tolling agreements&quot;—which, in effect, override the deadline—with the firms or individuals concerned, according to lawyers.&quot; Jean Eaglesham in The Wall Street Journal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">@DanielAlpert: Terrific irony that the home of the bank-bashing fictional cable news station on #TheNewsroom is actually Bank of America&#39;s NY headquarters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. sues Bank of America over sale of $850 million in mortgage-backed securities. &quot;Traders at Bank of America willfully misled investors about the quality of the residential mortgages tucked into the securities the bank sold at</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the start of the financial crisis, according to separate lawsuits filed Tuesday by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission Bank of America faces civil charges for allegedly hiding the risks associated with $850 million worth of securities backed by home loans.

Nothing could be further from the truth Building on these analogies, Summers vigorously argued on behalf of a consumer financial protection agency, and he supported strong safeguards designed to reduce the risk of another economic meltdown. Intensely focused on the problem of &quot;too big to fail,&quot; he was one of the earliest and most forceful advocates of promoting financial stability by requiring banks to have enough capital to withstand an economic downturn.&quot; Cass R.

A major bank or financial institution could meet every single regulatory requirement yet still be at risk of collapse, and few of us would even know it. Despite endless calls for change, many of the economists I&#39;ve spoken with have lamented that the reports that banks issue about their finances remain all but useless. The sprawling Dodd-Frank Act, which rewrote banking regulation in 2010, didn&#39;t resolve things so much as inaugurate a process of endless rules-writing by regulators.&quot; Adam Davidson in The New York Times.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Music recommendations interlude: George Harrison, &quot;What Is Life,&quot; 1971. Top opinion</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GALSTON: Behind the middle-class funk. &quot;Many economists define the middle class as those adults whose annual household income is between two-thirds and twice the national median—today, that means roughly</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$40,000 to $120,000. By this standard, according to the Pew Research Center, the middle class is significantly smaller than it once was. In 1971, it accounted for fully 61% of adults, compared with 14% for the upper class and 25% for the lower class. Four decades later, the middle class share had declined by 10 percentage points to just 51%, while the upper class share increased by six points and the lower class by four.

The Harvard economists Edward L. Glaeser and Jesse M. Shapiro have found that it has only a trivial impact. A major reason is that the deduction has long been capitalized into the prices of homes. That is, home prices are higher than they would be without the deduction. Thus to the extent that the deduction encourages home ownership, it is exactly offset by the extent to which high prices discourage home ownership.&quot; Bruce Bartlett in The New York Times.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BEBCHUK: Hedge funds are better than you think. &quot;[W]e undertook a comprehensive empirical investigation of the long-term consequences of activist interventions.

He also said he is taking executive action to widen the pool of borrowers eligible to receive loans from federally backed programs; many borrowers without the highest-quality credit have been locked out.

The average rate for a traditional 30-year fixed rate loan last week was 4.39 percent, compared to 3.34 percent in January. That has made refinancing look a lot less attractive for many households and their prospects are unlikely to get any better.&quot; Ylan Q.

At the same time, a 2007 law calls for rising use of ethanol, which makes up about 10% of the U.S. gasoline supply, and other fuels defined as renewable. That means the U.S. is heading toward the &quot;blend wall,&quot; the point at which fuel marketers can&#39;t absorb any more ethanol into the gasoline supply without using higher-percentage ethanol blends that aren&#39;t widely sold. As a result, on Tuesday the agency said that next year it would take the unprecedented step of seeking to reduce the</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">amount of renewable fuel that the oil industry must use, saying it &quot;does not currently foresee a scenario in which the market could consume enough ethanol.&quot;&quot; Ryan Tracy in The Wall Street Journal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Almost eight months late, EPA sets 2013 biofuel blend requirement. &quot;The Obama administration is calling for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16.55 billion of gallons of renewable fuel to be blended in with conventional gasoline this year as part of a federal program designed to wean the country off foreign oil and explore new energy sources.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has sharply increased its Washington presence in recent years, more than doubling what it spends to influence Congress and the executive branch over the past seven years as the Internet giant&#39;s business lines and interests mushroomed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That spending, which reached $2.5 million in 2012 and is on track to surpass that amount this year, includes retainers paid to six outside firms that seek to affect policy on a broad array of issues, including tax reform, Internet security, cloud computing and shipping. Among the company&#39;s high-profile lobbyists are former Senate majority leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), former senator John Breaux (D-La.) and Thomas Hale Boggs, a senior partner at Patton Boggs .</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, with Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos&#39;s planned purchase of The Washington Post, his company&#39;s profile in the capital is set to rise even further.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos sought to preempt concerns about his ownership of the paper, telling Post employees in a letter Monday, &quot;The paper&#39;s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company that Bezos built has much at stake in Washington, and high on Amazon&#39;s list is the sales tax on Internet commerce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a result of a pair of Supreme Court rulings, states can require out-of-state retailers to collect sales taxes from residents only if the companies have a physical presence in the state.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For years, Amazon fought efforts by states where it does not have such a presence to collect sales taxes on its transactions. But as it has built distribution warehouses across the country, the company has become a leading proponent of a bill that would allow all states to collect sales taxes from online retailers. The measure, known as the Marketplace Fairness Act, was approved by the Senate in the spring and is awaiting action in the House.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They want a level playing field,&quot; said Michael Mazerov, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who studies state tax issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has also hired leading tax lobbyists to prepare for what could be a broad overhaul of the tax code. Of greatest concern to the company, said Edward D. Kleinbard, who served as chief of staff of Congress&#39;s Joint Committee on Taxation, is any change to the way the United States deals with the foreign income of U.S. companies. Companies do not pay U.S. taxes on income earned by foreign subsidiaries unless it is returned to the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Companies are very concerned that they will be sold down the river by other multinationals with different priorities, so people hire a lot of lobbyists and try to make sure they&#39;re not the ox that gets gored,&quot; said Kleinbard, who teaches at the University of Southern California&#39;s law school.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company&#39;s recent lobbying efforts, detailed in disclosure reports filed with the Senate, show that its in-house lobbying arm is dealing with a wide variety of issues, including online wine sales, cybersecurity, postal reform, free-trade agreements and broadband service. Like many tech companies, Amazon has backed efforts at the Federal Communications Commission to expand broadband access.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company&#39;s lobbyists have also been active on the issue of cloud computing. Amazon has been fighting for a contract with the CIA that analysts say would cement the company&#39;s bona fides in the federal contracting field.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the past three years, Amazon has quickly expanded its presence in cloud computing with its Amazon Web Services unit, winning clients such as NASA, Samsung, Pfizer and the Public Broadcasting Service. This spring, the CIA chose the company for a $600 million cloud computing contract.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IBM, which had offered to do the job at a lower price, objected to the agency&#39;s decision, according to a review by the Government Accountability Office. IBM said that the CIA had unfairly changed some of the contract specifications in the middle of the process. The GAO agreed with IBM&#39;s main contention and in June urged the CIA to restart the contracting negotiations with its modified requirements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;In response to the GAO decision, the CIA has taken corrective action and remains focused on awarding a cloud contract for the intelligence community,&quot; agency spokesman Todd Ebitz said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two weeks ago, Amazon sued in Washington, asking a federal court to approve its contract with the CIA.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ken Doctor, a news industry analyst, said in a blog post there was a &quot;big downside&quot; to the owner of Amazon also owning The Post, because the Internet company has interests in several &quot;big political issues.&quot; He wrote, &quot;Amazon needs more friends in D.C., and it&#39;s hard to imagine what&#39;s better than owning the editorial page of the Washington Post in that quest.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Amazon spokesman declined to comment for this article.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the political front, the company is far from a heavy hitter. Its corporate political action committee donated</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$179,000 to federal candidates in the 2012 election cycle, and without a clear partisan pattern. It gave more to Republicans in House campaigns and far more to Democrats in Senate races. It gave $189,000 in the 2010 midterm congressional election cycle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By comparison, Google&#39;s political action committee donated $881,000 and Microsoft&#39;s PAC donated more than $1 million in the 2012 elections.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s increased spending on lobbying is similar to the spending pattern of many tech companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2005, it was spending $920,000 on lobbying but had ratcheted that up to $2.5 million by last year. This year, the company is on track to break its record. For the first half of the year, Amazon&#39;s lobbying spending is just over</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$1.7 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is also active in the Internet Association, which the firm launched with Facebook, Google, Yahoo and other Internet companies last year to help fight new regulations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;As a founding member of the Internet Association, Amazon is an industry leader helping educate policymakers about the powerful and rapidly growing Internet economy,&quot; said Michael Beckerman, the association&#39;s chief executive. &quot;Decisions made in Washington matter.

At the heart of Bezos&#39;s approach is an obsession with the customer&#39;s experience – a philosophy that drove the company&#39;s pioneering advances in targeting consumers and delivering goods.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We intend to build the world&#39;s most customer-centric company,&quot; he wrote to shareholders in 1999, as the young company was just expanding beyond online book selling into music and videos.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;One thing Bezos has understood is the relationship with the customer is everything,&quot; media analyst Ken Doctor said. &quot;You satisfy that customer, then you sell them more stuff.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos could figure out how to &quot;take the friction out of the buying process&quot; at newspapers, as Doctor put it, changing how readers subscribe for news, what they receive and when.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the new owner will have to exercise some caution in reinventing Post practices, Doctor said, adding: &quot;Do any of these things tread on the public&#39;s belief that the editors are simply trying to get them accurate, true stories?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s the bedrock principle, and you don&#39;t want to violate that principle.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos has said he will not run The Post&#39;s day-to-day operations and has yet to indicate how he might remake the newspaper. &quot;I don&#39;t want to imply that I have a worked-out plan,&quot; he told The Post in an interview Monday. &quot;This will be uncharted terrain, and it will require experimentation.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Martin D. Baron, executive editor of The Post, told the newsroom staff in a meeting Tuesday that he anticipates Bezos will challenge basic assumptions about the newspaper business, just as he has within other industries.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Certainly, my hope and expectation is that he will come with some ideas — some big ideas,&quot; said Baron, who noted he has not yet spoken with the new owner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Post is being bought by Bezos, who will own it privately. There is no indication that The Post will establish a special relationship with Amazon. But if the Post were to adopt some of the technology on which Amazon has built its success, this could dramatically change the paper&#39;s operations, boosting online advertising and cutting costs, technology analysts say.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Internet company knows its customers better than nearly any other retailer or media firm, analysts say. With software developed a decade ago and built in-house, Amazon has perfected the practice of tracking users on their site, analyzing that information, and then serving up recommendations of more products to sell to them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That information, particularly what users actually buy online, is more valuable than data gathered from Google searches and &quot;likes&quot; on Facebook, marketing experts say. And it&#39;s the sort of technology The Post could use to better understand its readers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If someone is interested only in Washington Nationals coverage and education policy news, for example, Amazon technology could easily deliver a customized home page built around those topics.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With more data about the newspaper&#39;s readers, its advertisers could better target consumers and be willing to pay a premium for those ads, said Tim Bajarin, head of technology research and consulting firm Creative Strategies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Everything is about personalization, and what Jeff has learned about customization of consumers&#39; personal needs can easily translate into the personal needs of an individual reader of a newspaper,&quot; Bajarin said. &quot;That would be a revolution for The Post.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Advertising has been a small but fast-growing part of Amazon&#39;s business. Some analysts estimate the firm generated $609.9 million in digital advertising in 2012, up 45.5 percent from the previous year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos — called the &quot;ultimate disrupter&quot; in a Fortune profile late last year — could institute changes at The Post that might be painful for the entire industry, analysts said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As Amazon barrels into a new venture, it often leaves damaged businesses in its wake. Small bookstores, music stores, and even big-box electronics firms have shuttered with the growth of online retail, critics say.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This is a highly disruptive innovator who knows how to change things at a paper like The Post, but it will take time, and it won&#39;t be easy,&quot; said Michael Levin, an analyst at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One move that Bezos might take at the outset is to end the paper&#39;s new online subscription program, which limits how many stories readers can access without paying for a subscription, according to Stone, a journalist who has covered Amazon for more than 14 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What is less customer-focused than a pay wall?&quot; he asked. &quot;You&#39;re making it harder for people to read your story at the same time that there&#39;s an abundance of competition.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For all the opportunities The Post offers for experimentation, the decision of the Internet pioneer to purchase the newspaper startled longtime Bezos watchers. In recent years, the Amazon founder has stressed the value of &quot;self-service&quot; platforms such as Amazon Web Services and Kindle Direct Publishing that skirt traditional gatekeepers like legacy media. &quot;Even well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation,&quot; Bezos wrote to shareholders in 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;That&#39;s one of the reasons the acquisition of The Post was a surprise,&quot; Stone said. &quot;But he is also willing to experiment — and willing to fail.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">matea.gold@washpost.com </a><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com" target="_blank">cecilia.kang@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Michael Rosenwald contributed to this report.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By now, everyone&#39;s heard that Jeff Bezos has bought The Washington Post. This is the same Jeff Bezos, of course, who also founded and runs Amazon, a sprawling company that has plenty of policy interests in D.C., as well as a multi-million-dollar lobbying operation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, Amazon won&#39;t own The Post. Bezos will. And, in his letter to employees, Bezos appeared to address any potential conflict of interest head-on: &quot;The values of The Post do not need changing,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The paper&#39;s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, we thought it would be worth taking another look at all the policy issues Amazon.com has taken a keen interest in over the years — what the company has been pushing for and why. Here&#39;s an overview:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- The lobbying shop. Amazon has grown steadily more comfortable with throwing its weight around Capitol Hill over the years. Back during the 2003-04 session, the company spent $1.8 million on lobbying. In 2011-2012, Amazon spent more than twice as much — $4.7 million, all told. You can see the steady growth in this chart from OpenSecrets.org:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That $4.7 million in the last congressional session is still far less than, say, Google, which spent a whopping $29 million over those two years. But when a fight over online sales taxes started burbling up in 2011, Amazon managed to amass a significant Hill presence in short order, working with key lobbying firms like Patton Boggs and Covington &amp; Burling.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to data tallied by the Sunlight Foundation, Amazon has now bent lawmakers&#39; ears on all sorts of topics: There&#39;s big stuff like taxes and telecom regulations and copyright law, but also smaller issues like consumer safety and law enforcement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- Amazon&#39;s sales tax battles. When it comes to policy, Amazon is perhaps most famous for its long, bitter fights with the states over Internet sales taxes. For years, online retailers weren&#39;t required to collect sales taxes due on items sold in states in which they didn&#39;t have a physical presence. Brick-and-mortar stores complained that this gave online retailers like Amazon a key financial edge.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And, for years, Amazon fought hard against state efforts to collect those taxes. When Texas announced in 2011 that it would try to collect back taxes from the firm, Amazon said it would leave the state. When Illinois tried to push Amazon to collect taxes by arguing that the company had thousands of affiliates inside the state, Amazon severed its ties with those affiliates. In California, Amazon pushed a ballot initiative to overturn a sales-tax law passed by the legislature.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those tax brawls may be coming to a close, however. This year, Amazon has backed a bill in Congress to require large online retailers to collect sales taxes on all purchases, in all states. Why the switch? The company said it prefers a national approach to patchwork state rules. But Amazon has also been moving to same-day shipping and is setting up physical warehouses in nearly every state — so, increasingly, it&#39;s already required to collect sales tax under existing rules anyway.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- Corporate tax reform. In July of this year, Amazon hired Capitol Tax Partners to lobby on tax-reform issues in Congress. The point person would be Jonathan Talisman, a former Senate finance staffer and a Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration. &quot;Amazon and other technology companies,&quot; the Hill explained, &quot;have urged Congress to cut the tax rate for income that they bring back to the United States.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- Keeping an eye on antitrust lawsuits. Amazon dominates the market for books and e-books in the United States, thanks to its willingness to price cheaply and bolster its market share. That topic hasn&#39;t come up in Congress, but it is intertwined with all sorts of other policy and legal issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Case in point: In July, the Justice Department won a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of conspiring with publishers to raise e-book prices. Amazon wasn&#39;t a defendant in that case, but it certainly had an interest in the outcome — and the federal judge who ruled against Apple noted that the publishers involved had agreed to the scheme out of &quot;fear and frustration&quot; over Amazon.com&#39;s control over e-book pricing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- The Internet Association. Amazon isn&#39;t just a retailer. It&#39;s also a tech giant. And the company underscored that fact when it linked arms with Silicon Valley mainstays like Facebook, Google, and Yahoo! in 2012 to form The Internet Association, which my colleagues described as a major push &quot;to counter efforts by federal regulators to strap new rules to their industry.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Internet Association was formed after a widely publicized legislative fight in 2011 against anti-piracy legislation (the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA). That measure failed, thanks to a large public backlash and hasty opposition from companies like Google and Amazon, but the brawl still convinced the big tech companies that they needed to ramp up their presence on Capitol Hill. The new group has staked out positions on everything from cyber-security to copyright and patent law to high-skilled immigration.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And the Internet Association is starting to flex its muscles. In April, the tech group was seen &quot;fighting back against a draft federal proposal that would make it easier for police to intercept online communications as they occur.&quot; In July, it railed against &quot;[a] proposed change to U.S. law that would allow state attorneys general to hold websites liable for content posted by users.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- Federal contracting. In addition to its work on the Hill, Amazon has also moved into the lucrative world of defense contracting. According to Quartz, Amazon recently landed a $600 million contract to build private cloud-computing services for the CIA. The company has been staffing up of late to build out this new endeavor, posting want ads for engineers who have top-secret security clearances.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- Amazon&#39;s workplace and labor issues. The New York Times recently reported that Amazon has been clashing with labor unions in Germany over wages. &quot;The subtext,&quot; the paper reported, &quot;is Amazon&#39;s opposition to unions in its warehouses as a general principle, because the company fears unions will slow down the kind of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">behind-the-scenes innovation that has propelled its growth.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s not the Times&#39;s editorializing. That was the explicit view of Dave Clark, Amazon&#39;s vice president of worldwide operations and customer services, who explained to the newspaper that &quot;Amazon views unions as intermediaries that will want to have a say on everything from employee scheduling to changes in processes for handling and packaging orders. Amazon prizes its ability to quickly introduce changes like these into its warehouses to improve the experience of its customers.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So far, Amazon hasn&#39;t loudly clashed with unions in the United States. None of its 90,000 workers are unionized. But the company has come under heavy scrutiny in recent years for labor practices at its warehouses. A widely read report in the The Morning Call two years ago documented poor conditions at the company&#39;s Pennsylvania facilities, including heat-stressed workers. (The company says it has since installed air conditioning.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- Amazon&#39;s interested in all sorts of smaller issues, too. You can see a list of bills in Congress that Amazon has taken a particular interest in here. The company has been heavily involved in legislation over online sales taxes (the &quot;Main Street Fairness Act&quot;), but it&#39;s also been active on bills dealing with credit-card swipe fees, as well as the Organized Retail Crime Act of 2009, which would have made organized retail theft a federal crime.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-- Political donations. There&#39;s more than lobbying. Amazon also operates a political action committee that gave</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$222,796 in the last election cycle. That was split pretty evenly between Democrats ($93,000) and Republicans ($86,500). This is small-bore stuff compared to long-established companies like General Electric or ExxonMobil, but Amazon&#39;s reach is slowly growing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, Amazon the company is different from Bezos himself. As David Graham outlines here, Bezos has made his own donations over the years, largely to Democrats like Washington&#39;s two senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell. He and his wife also donated $2.5 million to support a referendum on gay marriage last year in the state and opposed an effort to raise taxes in Washington on those making over $200,000 per year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps none of this will matter all that much for The Washington Post itself. It&#39;s impossible to say at this point. But it&#39;s worth being aware of all the same.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130806e986002s1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_040.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark74">-business-economy</a><a name="bookmark75">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon founder Jeff Bezos known for patience, focus on detail in his business ventures</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Peter Whoriskey;Jia Lynn Yang;Cecilia Kang 1,841 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Jeffrey P. Bezos, the Internet retail mogul and relentless business innovator who has agreed to buy The Washington Post, has a lesser-known trait that may serve him well amid the tumult of today&#39;s crumbling newspaper business: lots of patience.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The willingness to pursue a long-term vision was critical to the rise and persistence of Amazon.com, the global company he built from a suburban Seattle garage and through the travails of the dot-com bust and the recession.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of his private investments, such as his deal for The Post, are marked even more by a fascination with pursuing lofty goals requiring extremes of perseverance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos has invested millions in a space flight company, a reflection of his passion for &quot;moonshot&quot; innovations, and, perhaps most symbolic of his endurance, he is also helping to lead an effort to build a clock that will tick for 10,000 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s a special Clock, designed to be a symbol, an icon for long-term thinking,&quot; he has written of the machine, which is to be built inside a mountain in West Texas. &quot;As I see it, humans are now technologically advanced enough that we can create not only extraordinary wonders but also civilization-scale problems. We&#39;re likely to need more long-term thinking.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a letter to Post employees, Bezos said that &quot;journalism plays a critical role in a free society.&quot; In other remarks he has made clear his belief that journalism will endure despite the challenges wreaking havoc across U.S. newsrooms.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos has said he reads newspapers only in their digital form and warned that the industry&#39;s prosperity depends on its transition to new media.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Journalism is not going to disappear,&quot; Bezos told the German newspaper Berliner Zeitung in a November interview.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We have found out that people are willing to pay for their newspaper subscriptions on their tablets,&quot; he said. &quot;Tablets will further influence our everyday life. Soon every household will have more than one tablet. This will be normal. And these trends will strengthen newspapers.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When asked whether the Kindle Fire or iPad could save newspapers, Bezos said: &quot;I would not go that far and speak of saving newspapers. The enduring transition period from printed to digital newspapers is difficult to handle for many publishing houses businesswise, because they have to offer print and digital at the same time. They have to be present at both fields, and that is a problem.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He predicted in the interview that printed newspapers will not be commonly used in 20 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Born in 1964 in Albuquerque to a 17-year-old mother, Bezos never met his biological father. He was adopted by Mike Bezos, who married his mother just before he was born. Jeff took his stepfather&#39;s last name.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The family moved around a bit, and Bezos graduated as class valedictorian from a high school in Miami-Dade County, already harboring dreams of being a space entrepreneur. He attended Princeton, from which he graduated summa cum laude majoring in electrical engineering and computer science. While working at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw in New York and researching the possibilities of e-commerce, Bezos realized that one of the most obvious things to sell online was books.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sensing the possibility of the Internet, Bezos quit his Wall Street job and drove with his wife cross-country to Seattle. Bezos started building the foundation for Amazon.com in the garage of his rented house in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue. In 1995, the site opened for business. It became a hit and quickly undermined traditional retailers, both local and national. Amazon also became a target of criticism for its working conditions at warehouses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In describing Bezos, business associates and former employees tell stories that make one of three points: He pursues ambitious plans, he focuses on pleasing customers and he is willing to make even minute demands of his employees to achieve his ends.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Customers can write e-mails directly to Bezos, who frequently responds to comments or complaints. Nadia Shouraboura, who until recently worked closely with Bezos on Amazon&#39;s senior executive team, also called the &quot;S-Team&quot; at the company, remembers getting an e-mail from Bezos on a Friday night about a customer whose package showed up a day late.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;To me, it&#39;s one case — one of a million. But if you think about it the way Jeff thinks about it, if we missed one package, we probably missed others,&quot; Shouraboura said. &quot;So that would be a big deal.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Her entire team worked through the night trying to figure out what went wrong. It turned out to be a package going on a truck half a minute late. Bezos expected a detailed e-mail afterward on exactly what went wrong and how to prevent the same mistake from happening again.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;He&#39;s very detailed, down to the lowest level of detail,&quot; Shouraboura said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos can often come across as gregarious and intensely focused — some employees have described him as &quot;unblinking.&quot; His infamous loud cackle of a laugh is often what signals his presence in the company&#39;s new gleaming and sprawling campus headquarters outside downtown Seattle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He also has an unusual style of running meetings: Instead of having someone give a PowerPoint presentation in typical corporate fashion, Bezos has the presenter write a paper that can be no longer than six pages outlining his or her ideas</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Like seriously, if it&#39;s 61 / 2, you don&#39;t go,&quot; Shouraboura said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Such meetings begin with everyone reading the paper in silence — for as long as 40 minutes. Afterward, people start asking questions and sharing their opinions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The idea is that reading the paper first allows the discussion to go deeper.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I think if you&#39;re not prepared, or if you haven&#39;t done your homework, or you didn&#39;t think it through, you&#39;re not going to survive,&quot; said Shouraboura, who ran the company&#39;s global supply chain. If faced with an Amazon employee who didn&#39;t prepare well enough for a meeting, Bezos might walk out of the meeting, yell or simply ask the person to write the paper again.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos, who ranks 11th on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest individuals in the United States, with a net worth of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$25.2 billion, has given little indication of his political leanings over the years. He has not been a heavy contributor to political campaigns, although he and his wife have regularly donated to the campaigns of Sen. Patty Murray</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(D-Wash.). In years past, they have given modest contributions to a handful of Republican and Democratic senators.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos&#39;s political profile rose suddenly and sharply when he and his wife, MacKenzie, agreed last year to donate</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$2.5 million to help pass a referendum measure that would legalize same-sex marriage in Washington state, catapulting them to the top ranks of financial backers of gay rights in the country. The donation doubled the money available to the initiative, which was approved in November and made Washington among the first states to pass same-sex marriage by popular vote.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps the single biggest item on Amazon&#39;s legislative agenda is a bill that would empower all states to collect sales tax from online retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is required to collect the tax only in states where it maintains a physical presence, such as a warehouse. But Amazon now is supporting the bill, which has passed the Senate and is pending in the House. State sales taxes no longer pose a real threat to Amazon; with an emphasis on same-day shipping, the company is building distribution warehouses across the country and would have to pay the tax anyway.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like Washington Post Co. Chairman Donald E. Graham, Bezos has shown support for efforts to change education policy, including the creation and expansion of public charter schools.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Bezos Family Foundation — whose board includes Bezos, his parents and other family members — gave more than $11million in 2011 to an array of national organizations such as Teach for America, Stand for Children and the KIPP Foundation, according to tax filings. The foundation also gave grants to scores of individual schools around the country as well as several charter school chains, including Uncommon Schools, which operates schools in New York and Massachusetts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos&#39;s parents, Mike and Jackie, were active in a fierce battle last year to allow the creation of public charter schools in Washington state. Washington had been one of a handful of states that did not permit charters, which are publicly funded schools that are privately run and largely without unions. Teachers unions opposed the ballot measure, which narrowly passed with financial backing from Mike and Jackie Bezos as well as Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Netflix founder Reed Hastings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps the most striking aspect of Jeff Bezos&#39;s business career, however, is his willingness to endure short-term losses — something many newspapers have been forced to do in recent years — in order to prosper later. This can be particularly difficult in the face of impatient investors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;One thing that I learned within the first couple of years of starting a company is that inventing and pioneering involves a willingness to be misunderstood for long periods of time,&quot; Bezos said this year in a Harvard Business Review.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Today, for example, the company sells its Kindle devices at a loss. It is also willing to pay for expensive delivery to gain clients of its premium Prime membership. Last month, the company announced that it will hire 5,000 employees at these warehouses, an ambitious growth strategy that is hurting profits in the short run.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The chief characteristic of Amazon is that it is relentless,&quot; said Dan Gillmor, a journalism professor at Arizona State University and tech columnist (Gillmor owns a small stock holding in Amazon). &quot;That is good news for The Post, because if this is a baseball game, we are, at the most, at the bottom of the third inning in the evolution of a 20th-century news model to one that is more diverse and part of a complicated ecosystem of news and information.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brad Stone, who recently completed a book about Bezos and Amazon, said he was surprised by the announcement because Bezos has been skeptical of &quot;old guard&quot; institutions that served as gatekeepers before the Internet and are vulnerable to the forces that have since been unleashed. On the other hand, &quot;he also believes that his business methods are broadly applicable. He is definitely a capitalist and very much an</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">innovator.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Said Shouraboura: &quot;Jeff is a man of big vision. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he does something astronomically innovative and interesting and different. That&#39;s just him.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:jialynn.yang@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">peter.whoriskey@washpost.com </a><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">jialynn.yang@washpost.com </a><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com" target="_blank">cecilia.kang@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Alice Crites, Paul Farhi, Jan Friedmann and Lyndsey Layton contributed to this report.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unless you&#39;ve been living under a rock, you&#39;ve probably heard that The Washington Post will soon be coming under new ownership.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com will be taking the reins. Bezos, 49, has done most of his political talking with his checkbook, shelling out millions in support of gay marriage last year and thousands more over the years on behalf of mostly Democratic candidates. Those who know Bezos say he has libertarian leanings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here, in more detail, are the five biggest things to know about his politics:</p><ol id="l6"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He gave big to defend gay marriage last year. Bezos&#39;s most notable step into the political arena came in 2012, when he put a whopping $2.5 million into the campaign to defend gay marriage in the state of Washington. It was the largest donation of its kind, and came in response to to an appeal from a former Amazon employee, according to the Seattle Times. The former employee had asked Bezos to chip in less than a tenth of what he and his wife ended up giving.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He&#39;s been described as a libertarian. Early Amazon investor Nick Hanauer has described Bezos as a libertarian. And Bezos has donated to the nonprofit organization that publishes Reason.com, the Web site of the libertarian magazine with the same name. He also put $100,000 toward the defeat of a 2010 measure that would have imposed an income tax on top earners in the Evergreen State.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He&#39;s mostly given to Democratic candidates. Campaign finance records show that Bezos has mostly given to Democratic candidates for federal and state office, including Washington&#39;s two senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell. He&#39;s donated money over the years to Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and then-Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.), all of whom served on the either the House or Senate Judiciary committees, which, as Political Moneyline notes, are responsible for some Internet-related issues. Bezos also gave to former eBay CEO Meg Whitman (R), who lost in the 2010 California governor&#39;s race.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His mother and stepfather were big supporters of charter schools. Bezos&#39;s mother and stepfather gave a total of $1 million in 2012 in support of an education initiative that narrowly passed. The measure will allow up to 40 charter schools to open in Washington state during the next five years. Meanwhile, Bezos gave $100,000 to support charter schools in a 2004 referendum.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s PAC gives to both parties: It&#39;s also worth noting that Amazon.com has a political action committee, to which Bezos and his wife have donated. The PAC split its donations pretty evenly between Republican and Democratic candidates for Congress last cycle. Democratic House and Senate contenders received $93,000, while Republicans got $86,500, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fixbits:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">President Obama told Jay Leno he is &quot;frustrated&quot; by Russia&#39;s decision to grant Edward Snowden asylum.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It looks like Detroit&#39;s next mayor will either be Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon or former Detroit Medical Center CEO Mike Duggan.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Here&#39;s an unlikely political alliance: Left-leaning Media Matters has joined the RNC&#39;s fight against CNN and NBC.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Washington Post Co. chairman and chief executive Donald Graham joined Brook Silva-Braga on PostTV&#39;s The Fold Monday to discuss the details beind the sale of the paper to Amazon.com&#39;s Jeff Bezos. A transcript of the interview follows.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">BSB: The Washington Post has been sold to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The announcement was a surprise. Donald Graham the CEO and Chairman of The Washington Post Company gave the news to staffers Monday afternoon. Now joins us to discuss the deal and his family&#39;s legacy. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: Of course, Brook, I&#39;m glad to.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: I wanna talk about the deal. But first you were born into this paper in this company. You&#39;ve spent your whole life with this company. This had to be an emotional day for you.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: Yeah, almost the first thing I remember was driving down to the Post building and watching Harry Truman&#39;s inaugural parade in I guess January 1949 and, uh, uh, watching from my Dad&#39;s office. The Post building then fronted Pennsylvania Avenue. And, uh, one thing I remember there was, there were lots of tanks. My sis-… my sister and I would have been, uh, would have been watching.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: And your-your son Will is standing here. I asked him what-what this meant for him, how he felt. He just, he used the word sad.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: Well I think every Graham, not only every Graham, but everybody at the top of The Washington Post Company had the same reaction when we first started to think about the possibility, which was great surprise, sadness. But the reason we started to think about it, Brook, is the point of our family&#39;s ownership and we were brought up to understand this was always supposed to be that it was good for the Post. And as last year ended, I sat down with, uh, the publisher of the Post, Katharine Weymouth, who is also Katharine Graham&#39;s granddaughter and the daughter of my stalwart sister Lally whose story from Egypt led the Post on Sunday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: Yeah.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: And Katharine and I started to look at the numbers, realized that this year 2013 would be the seventh straight year of significant declining revenues. We knew we could keep the Post alive. We knew it could survive. But our wish, our aspirations for the Post have always been highered by that, so we went to see if we could find a buyer. We were represented by an investment bank called Alan Company. Their people had two early conversations with Jeff who surprised me by expressing quite a bit of interest but then stopped, and then stopped talking to the Alan Company people.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: And when was that? When did you first have contact with Bezos?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">DG: Ah, it was in the first half, it was I would guess March or April this year, but I don&#39;t honestly know. BSB: Okay. But just a few months ago. This all happened pretty quickly, it all happened in secret.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: But, uh, well a few months, a few months ago, but this is kind of interesti-… I thi-… I find this both interesting and important. Jeff, uh, Jeff had those conversations and then there was a pause in the conversations for two months. And I thought he had simply terminated the conversations, but it turned out he was thinking about it. And Jeff&#39;s a very analytical person and I&#39;m sure he was looking over numbers and wondering whether he thought he could make the business succeed. Jeff then reached out to me less than a month ago. We met at a conference face to face twice the second week in July. We spent an hour together. He asked to for time to study the</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">numbers. We then spent another two hours together. And at the end of it, he said that he thought he wanted to go ahead. But he obviously he and his team needed time to really look over the business and understand it more thoroughly. Um, and then we-we, he did and we quickly reached a deal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: Was his the highest offer?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: Um, his, yes, his was the highest offer and the one we accepted. We did talk to other people. There&#39;s not a great number of other people, uh, certainly less than a dozen. But it&#39;s pretty obvious that Jeff Bezos has a certain strength when it comes to the future of news. You know, when you think about that growing and growing and growing digital and mobile audience, Jeff knows a lot about that. He knows how to reach people and he knows how to establish commercial relationships with advertisers and others. And that, uh, it&#39;s not that he&#39;s gonna walk in with a pre-packaged solution to the problems of the newspaper business. He is absolutely not, but he didn&#39;t do this impulsively. He did this after thinking for a couple of months. And I believe he will do just what he says in his message to employees, come in, experiment and see what works.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: Is he buying the paper to turn a profit or because of some of the other intangible things that the paper can do?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: I hope to hell he turns a big profit, but that&#39;s not why he&#39;s buying it. He had many, uh, more profitable companies he could have bought. Many more, uh, many investments where the return would be greater. The one thing about Jeff is that everybody knows he is very, very long term minded and he&#39;s shown it in his management of Amazon and in for instance the invention of the Kindle, which was not a moneymaker for years and years, but became big and became, uh, successful. So, um, no, he&#39;s, I-I hope the Post makes a tremendous amount of money for Jeff&#39;s sake and for the sake of everybody else who works here. But, uh, will Jeff and the team here and Jeff has offered job, Jeff has offered, has said that the team will, the Post will continue to operate under the management of the editor, the publisher, and everybody else who&#39;s here today.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: Is that indefinitely or for a certain amount of time?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: By contract it&#39;s for a year that, uh, Jeff, uh, that everybody is, well the, you could read the contract because we&#39;ve posted it on, uh, on the SEC site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: A lot of people are using this as a-a chance to make grand pronouncements about the newspaper business. I wanna give you a chance to kind of give your analysis of what this says about the future of journalism, the future of print journalism. Does this mean newspapers are loss leaders for bigger organizations and family ownership doesn&#39;t make as much sense? What should we take out of this?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">DG: Well I&#39;ve never, um, I&#39;ve never been one for grand pronouncements and I don&#39;t have one today. I think… BSB: Oh come on, help me out.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: I think that, uh, um, everybody knows that newspapers have to change. We have been changing. Your very presence here on this set is, uh, is evidence of that. But we are going to, uh, we&#39;re gonna be guided by somebody Warren Buffet has called in his opinion the best CEO in the United States. Somebody who is a good technologist himself, but who knows so many other great technologists, knows who can, who is best to work on certain problems. He&#39;ll decide thoughtfully what are the best steps for the Post including-including but not limited to digital steps. I would, I would bet on Jeff to become a little bit interested in the old fashioned print newspaper business. But we will, uh, we will become a place that does its traditional job, maintains its traditional values, but tries things and I hope a lot of them will succeed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: A couple last quick things. Does this affect the pay wall at all?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: Oh no. I mean, Jeff has said, management will continue, policies will continue. It is, it will be up to Jeff when the transaction closes, which won&#39;t be for at least a couple of months, around a couple of months, but he&#39;ll decide what policies to pursue. But he-he is not, he is not telling me that he wants to change any policies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: The Graham Family will own the paper for I guess 60 more days.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: Well-well that-that remains to be determined. We&#39;ve-we&#39;ve got a binding contract with Jeff. Now we will reach a definitive agreement. I&#39;m talking lawyer talk here too.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: Yeah.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: That-that, uh, will be around 60 days, maybe a little more, maybe a little less.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">BSB: And I&#39;m trying to not a lawyerly moment, trying to lead you into more introspective moment. DG: Yeah.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">BSB: Of what about after the sale goes through? Have you thought about what you will do, how you will feel? DG: After the sale goes through…</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: What-what you will step back and say from 1933 to 2013, our family owned this paper and it did good and great things with it and we&#39;re proud of that and we look back on that era and think and say and feel what?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: Well you said that very well. I&#39;m gonna have to have you do interviews for me. [LAUGH] But, uh, the, no,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">we-we, uh, uh, I have spent 42 years of my life working in this building, basically all my working career. Uh, and I love this place and I&#39;m really devoted to its future and its success.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSB: Did you think of your Mom today?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">DG: I certainly did. And I think so did everybody in that room. Uh, for sure. BSB: And what were you thinking of?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: Well I-I thought a lot about, uh, the history of this place. I ca-… uh, I came to work here in the year when the Supreme, when we printed stories based on the Pentagon Papers and the Supreme Court made that decision. The following year was the year of Watergate. And I have been here for great achievements and great times and some that weren&#39;t so great. But I think to, I ho-… I-I believe that today&#39;s, uh, uh, what happened today, today&#39;s events mean that the Po-… as I said, it definitely means the Post is gonna be a very, very exciting place to work and to read. And I hope it means that there are decades of more great papers and great achievements and great news products, news, uh, that this is the great, you know, the, it gives us a chance to be a very special news organization of the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">BSB: Thank you much for your time. DG: Thanks, Brook.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">BSB: And obviously your leadership on behalf of the rest of the newsroom. DG: Thank you, Brook.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:nicki.demarco@washpost.com">nicki.demarco@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130806e986005vb</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_043.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark80">local</a><a name="bookmark81">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos on newspapers, media and innovation</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Mark Berman 657 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As you have undoubtedly heard by now, Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos is going to purchase The Washington Post. He will become the sole owner of the news organization when the sale wraps up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos, who built Amazon into a mammoth retailer and has experience with publishing as well as with readers and tablets, hasn&#39;t said much so far about his vision for The Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But writing to Post employees this week, he did touch on the future of the industry. And he has spoken in the past about shifts in the media landscape, changes looming for the news business and general innovation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a letter to Post employees, Bezos said this about what lies ahead:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Internet is transforming almost every element of the news business: shortening news cycles, eroding long-reliable revenue sources, and enabling new kinds of competition, some of which bear little or no</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">news-gathering costs. There is no map, and charting a path ahead will not be easy. We will need to invent, which means we will need to experiment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the past, Bezos noted that the end was in sight for print editions of newspapers. He discussed this and much more in an interview last year with the German publication Berliner-Zeitung. (That story, which was found by Andrew Kaczynski, was printed in German; the text has been translated to English by The Post&#39;s Jan Friedmann.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When asked whether he reads printed newspapers, Bezos replied by saying:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No, not any more. The print publishing business is going trough a difficult transition period which is not completed yet. Personally I have concluded this transition by reading newspapers only in their digital versions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He said that tablet computers (like, one assumes, Amazon&#39;s Kindles) offered hope for the future:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is like this: People are not ready to pay for news on the web, and this will not change agai n. But we have found out that people are willing to pay for their newspaper subscriptions on their tablets. Tablets will further influence our everyday life. Soon every household will have more than one tablet. This will be normal. And these trends will strengthen newspapers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the era of the printed newspaper is coming to a close, he said:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One thing is for sure: In 20 years to come we will not have printed newspapers any more. And if, then only as luxury products that certain hotels offer their guests as an extra service. Printed newspapers will not be of common use in 20 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bezos did say in the interview that when print papers have fully given way to digital publications, &quot;There will be a place for quality journalism then journalism is not going to disappear.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon has also made forays into publishing, and Bezos has spoken about these efforts. Last year, he talked with Fortune about an e-book product that regularly delivers books to Kindle readers. Bezos&#39;s comments are in bold:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s an homage to the bygone era when writers like Charles Dickens published their novels in newspapers one chapter at a time before collecting the work in book form. Kindle Serials is not likely to amount to a giant revenue stream for Amazon, which will ring up more than $60 billion in sales this year. But listening to the way Bezos talks</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">about the history of serialization, you get a glimpse of his concept of customer feedback — and how Amazon acts on it. &quot;Even in Dickens&#39;s day, he would take notice of the criticism of the prior installments and use it to his advantage,&quot; he says.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2003, Bezos gave a TED talk about innovation. He noted that innovation perpetuates additional shifts, saying, &quot;Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.&quot; You can watch the talk here:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Amrita Jayakumar and Jan Friedmann contributed to this report.

A transcript of the interview follows.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: I&#39;m joined by Katharine Weymouth today who&#39;s publisher of The Washington Post. Thanks so much for being here. Big day today, and this is the paper today. Katharine, I&#39;m sure it landed on your doorstep this morning</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">- how did we get to this moment?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: You know it really was a process. The fam – the paper has been in my family for 80 years going back to when my great-grandfather bought it, and we&#39;ve as a family been incredibly proud to steward the business and be affiliated with it and hope to go on for generations to come and as Don and I and the board started looking at our future we began to ask ourselves the question of whether or not the Washington Post Company was still the right home for the Post and you know we think of this is not a regular business. This is a mission-driven business, and the goal is to preserve and enhance and enrich the mission, which is the journalism. And so that was what we really began to focus on was, is there an owner out there who could be a better owner for the Post in a private company, really invest in it, bring new assets to bear, and we found that in Jeff Bezos.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: And why do you think Jeff will be a better owner? What does he bring to the table other than a sort of private structure ownership? What does he bring in terms of a vision?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: Well, you know, he has a proven track record as an entrepreneur. He is always focused on the long view. He invests for the long term, he is famous for ignoring Wall Street when he does that, and needless to say he takes tremendous technological expertise. So it almost is sort of a shift to a new generation and to a new family. I  mean, it&#39;s going from one family to another family, and what we like about Jeff is that he shares our values. He understands that the paper is going to write articles about Amazon and him and his friends that he may not like, and he understands that. So he&#39;s not going to interfere editorially. He believes in what we do, and he&#39;s buying it, because he wants to see it go on for generations to come.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: And Don talked about cuts that you all were looking at. Are those cuts still going to happen?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: Well, I think Jeff has the same view that Don held, which is you can&#39;t just lose money for years on end. So, I think he&#39;ll be willing to invest if he can see where we&#39;re going, but he&#39;s not going to want to lose his – this is his own personal money, remember, not shareholder money. So he has asked us to do as Don had, stay profitable but you don&#39;t have to be very profitable. So I think we will have to continue to cut our cost structure. I think there&#39;s</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">– that&#39;s just the world we&#39;re in. But I think Jeff also wants to invest, and he will have ideas once he gets a chance to get to know us and look at our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: Did he share any of those ideas with you?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: No, what I like partly about him is that he&#39;s not coming in here with, here&#39;s my list of ideas of everything you should do.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: Right.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: He&#39;s very humble about saying, &quot;look, I&#39;m new to this business. You guys know this business a lot better than I do.&quot; And he&#39;s said to me, &quot;Katherine, look I have a job.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: Right.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: And I like my job. I&#39;m the CEO of Amazon, and I need you and your team to run the Post. So he&#39;s humble about that. I&#39;m sure he will have ideas, but he&#39;s not arrogant enough to come in and say, &quot;Well, here&#39;s my ideas of how you should do it better.&quot; I think he&#39;s going to get to know the team, the business, and then I have no doubt he&#39;ll have ideas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: Any sense of – I mean he&#39;s not a news guy. He offered his sort of sense of vision of what the paper would cover. It was like restaurant openings, governors, government, didn&#39;t mention politics, didn&#39;t mention foreign policy. Why did you go with a non-news guy?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: Well, I think he&#39;s an incredible, voracious reader. He&#39;s famous for his reading, right? He started Amazon as a book-selling company. He was telling me that one of the ways he likes to get together with employees and get to know them is literally by doing a book club and discussing books, so he&#39;s not a news guy per se because he hasn&#39;t been affiliated with the news, but I know he&#39;s a voracious reader of news and consumer of news, and that&#39;s something I also like. At Amazon he is relentlessly focused on the customer, and our business is the same. We are relentlessly focused on our readers and the other customers: our advertisers. And we&#39;re only going to win, if we can serve readers content that is interesting and that is unique, and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve always been trying to do.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: And your sense of your tenure here, you have said you&#39;re going to stay on. Do you have a sense of how long that will be that you stay on? Are there sort of contractual obligations or what&#39;s your sense?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: Well, there&#39;s no contract. I didn&#39;t have a contract with Don, either. I think obviously I will serve at Jeff&#39;s whim and so I love the paper, I love the team and the people I work with. I will stay as long as he will have me, but I will have to do a good job, like any executive would.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: You talked about in the beginning, this is a paper now that&#39;s changing hands from one family to the next family. Can you talk to me about that moment when you decided that that was going to happen – that you were going to transfer this paper that is part of your identity and part of your family to another family – what was that like?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: Well, it was really part of a process. It wasn&#39;t sort of one day we said, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s do this.&quot; And we were very clear, Don and I and the board, that we were not just going to sell to anyone. If we could not find the right buyer that we thought was the right person to take the paper forward, we would not sell. So it evolved over months, and it really was about looking for somebody who could bring assets to bear, whether it&#39;s technology or deep-pockets or managerial experience – but also shared our values. And although I know selfishly we would have loved to have kept the paper in our family, for generations to come, it had to be about more than what we wanted, right? I mean, the Post is bigger than the Graham family, and we&#39;ve always understood that it was a public trust and treated it as such.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: What was it like yesterday to hear your Uncle Don talk about the paper and be very choked up – people in the audience there in that auditorium choked up, crying, a very sad day for folks around here – what was that like?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: Well, it was just him, right? I mean, it was a sad day for all of us, but Don has grown up in Washington and with this paper in this family, and he really does love everyone here, and he does love what we do. And as he said he will continue to read the paper from cover to cover and be rooting us on, so I think it was very hard, and we all saw that, but it was also very real, and it&#39;s a big deal, right? There&#39;s been such a tight affiliation between the Graham family and the employees here, and so it&#39;s an emotional moment, but I also sensed walking around afterwards a sense of gratitude to the family, but also some excitement and some appreciation for the fact that this is a transition to a good owner who has a lot he could bring to us and that we were not on the auction block and just auctioned to the highest bidder.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: Any sense of loss or even failure on your part? They talked about you and the paper recently in the New York Times, the next edition, Katharine the second. I mean, what&#39;s your sense of what this means for your legacy?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: Well, I guess because I&#39;m going on with the newspaper, I don&#39;t think of it as my legacy. So, I&#39;ve always felt at the end of the day we&#39;ll be judged by our results. I think the paper is as good if not better than it ever was and we will continue to work on that, so my legacy will be when I leave, how good is our news business?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: And you&#39;re right, I think the Post has had a really solid – I mean I feel like over these last 18 months and you talk to people in the newsroom feel like we&#39;ve had a really great run, is this going to disrupt that at all with Bezos coming in or is it business as usual going forward?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: Well, I think there&#39;s some natural disruption just as people are anxious when there&#39;s a change like this, but what I and my team and what I think everyone is going to work to do is to stay focused. It is business as usual. It should be business as usual. The difference is we have a new owner who has made clear that he&#39;s not going to come in and interfere in our day-to-day management, so who I think will just bring good ideas and help, but isn&#39;t planning on telling us what to do, and we&#39;ve had a fantastic first six months of the year, and we ought to have a fantastic next six months of the year, so you know what I want everyone to do is just keep doing what we&#39;ve been doing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: We&#39;ve heard a lot about Jeff Bezos including that he has a 10,000-year clock out in the desert. Can you describe him in one word?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: Brilliant. I mean it&#39;s hard to describe anyone in one word, but he is brilliant and willing to take risks, but smart risks. And the clock is a perfect example of how he invests for the long term. It is a 10,000-year clock that literally will tick every millennium. That&#39;s wild. Most people don&#39;t think of, what will my legacy be 10,000 years from now? But I think as a newspaper owner, that&#39;s what we want. We don&#39;t want somebody who&#39;s focused on quarter to quarter what did you make? We want somebody who&#39;s focused on you know for the next generation of reader – for his kids, for my kids, for your kids how are they going to digest news, and how are we going to make it interesting for them? And what platforms will they want it on? And so, that&#39;s why I think he&#39;s the perfect guy for this.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMH: Bob Woodward said when you took over that you had the weight of the world on your shoulders. How do you feel? Where&#39;s that weight now? Is it gone? How do you feel?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">KW: Well, that was Woodward&#39;s characterization. I have never – I can&#39;t focus like that. I mean, there&#39;s certainly a lot of media scrutiny of the media, but my focus is on making sure we&#39;re doing great work, because our customers are the readers and our advertising customers, and those are the people I&#39;m focused on serving.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">NMH: Katharine, thank you, so much.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Don Graham&#39;s grandfather, Eugene Meyer, bought The Washington Post in 1933. His mother, Katharine Graham, led it to greatness in the 1960s and &#39;70s. He was publisher from 1979 to 2000. Today, he leads the Post company, and his niece, Katharine Weymouth, is publisher of the paper. And this week, he announced that he&#39;s selling The Washington Post to Amazon&#39;s Jeff Bezos.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We spoke Tuesday morning about how the sale came about and what it means for the future of the paper the Graham family built. A lightly edited transcript follows.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Ezra Klein: Let&#39;s begin at the beginning. What specifically made you decide to sell The Washington Post? Don Graham: I&#39;m the chairman of the board of the Washington Post Company -- the soon-to-be renamed</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Washington Post Company -- which owns four large businesses, one of which is the newspaper it&#39;s named for. I</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">came to work for The Post as a reporter in January 1971. I&#39;ve worked in the company for the last 42 years. And I never until this year even imagined the possibility that we might think about selling.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But at the end of last year, as we do at the end of every year, Katharine Weymouth, who&#39;s the publisher of the post and my niece, and I sat down to look at how 2012 had gone and what we could forecast about the next three years; 2013 we knew was probably going to be the seventh year in a row of declining revenues and particularly declining print advertising revenues. Looking at the trends, our response to declining revenues has always been to try and innovate. Wonkblog is an example of that. We&#39;ve had a lot of successful innovation at The Washington Post. But the innovations, though very high quality, weren&#39;t offsetting the decline in revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As we looked ahead, if revenues kept declining we&#39;d have no choice but to keep cutting. Roughly 85 percent of stock in the Post Company is owned by shareholders not in the Graham family. So the money we&#39;re losing isn&#39;t our own. We didn&#39;t feel good about that. Still we were quite certain that The Post could survive and have a long future, but we wanted to do more than survive. We wanted to be successful and expanding and financially strong. So for the first time in either of our lives we asked ourselves if we thought our small public company was still the best place for the newspaper. We didn&#39;t at that time make the decision to sell but we made a decision to think about it,</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EK: How did the process work? Paul Farhi reported yesterday that you spoke to at least a half-dozen buyers. Can you tell me anything about them?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">DG: There are a number of ways in which people sell businesses. We did not, as is sometimes the case, hold an auction where you take bids from any prospective buyer. Our aim was to see if there was a buyer who could give shareholders a fair deal and make the Post newspaper stronger in some way. We spoke with fewer than a dozen corporations and individuals not all of whom were in tech.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos was always a particularly intriguing possibility but I was surprised when he expressed an initial interest because Jeff is famously, single-mindedly focused on Amazon. He had two conversations with Allen and Co., the firm we were working with on the sale, and then those conversations ceased, and I assumed he&#39;d decided he had no interest, But instead he e-mailed me less than a month ago and asked if we could get together. We did, twice, we spent more than three hours talking over the course of those meetings and at the end of those meetings, he told me he was interested and serious and quickly sent a team to explore our financials, and we arrived at an agreement pretty quickly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EK: Tell me a bit about your relationship with Bezos prior to this deal. How did you first meet him?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: I&#39;ve known him for 15 years. My memory is we were introduced by Katharine Graham who&#39;d met him at various conferences. She had always wanted to know great technology people. She knew Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and Andy Grove at Intel was a very close friend of hers. We both liked the same things about Jeff. He&#39;s direct and decent, very smart and funny. And you have to be impressed by the business he built, the way they take care of their customers, and the way the technology and everything at Amazon has gotten better and better.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most of our conversations between then and now were me asking him for advice about news and technology. When he was starting the Kindle, he invited me and a few other people from The Post out to Seattle. I was very impressed again because, typically of the businesses Jeff runs, he lost a lot of money starting the Kindle, and it wasn&#39;t clear it would be a success. But of course it was a huge success.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EK: Tell me about those conversations. What are Bezos&#39;s thoughts on the media? What kind of news consumer is he?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: Here are a few things I&#39;ve learned in the past two weeks. When Jeff holds meetings at Amazon he asks people not to use Powerpoints but to write an essay about their product or program or what the meeting is to be about. For the first 10 or 15 minutes everyone sits and reads the essay. His point is that if you write at length, you have to think first, and he feels the quality of thought you have to do to write at length is greater than the quality of thought to put a Powerpoint together. He also says to get to know people he calls daylong meetings about books where everyone reads the same book and talks about [it]. So he&#39;s a reader.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The quality of his thought and advice to me over the past few years is reflected in the memo he wrote to the staff. His philosophy is to try things. Try things and experiment, and if it doesn&#39;t work, try more.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EK: Does Bezos come in knowing where he wants to take The Post and what kind of changes he wants to make, or is he buying the institution and figuring out what to do with it later?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: You should ask him, but what he says in the memo that he wrote -- and he&#39;s an absolutely truthful man -- is that it&#39;s the latter. He&#39;s a very good businessman and technologist, but not a magician. He doesn&#39;t come in knowing how to fix things. But he comes in knowing how he&#39;d think about fixing things. One of the biggest things he brings is, if you&#39;re Jeff Bezos, you know lots and lots of technologists. He knows a lot of people and what they&#39;re good at and my guess will be he&#39;ll identify the problems and think about who should work on them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EK: What about local news? You&#39;ve always emphasized that The Post is first and foremost a local paper. Your family has deep roots in this city. Bezos doesn&#39;t live here and isn&#39;t planning to move. How will that emphasis change?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: He doesn&#39;t live here but he&#39;s a businessman, and he&#39;ll quickly see the importance of local news, local revenue and local readers to this business. He understands the vast majority of our revenues will come from print. Print will get a lot of his attention. Eugene Meyer, my grandfather, bought the paper in 1933 and had zero experience in the newspaper business when he bought it. But his ownership turned out to be very good for the post, and I hope Jeff&#39;s will be as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EK: Bezos runs a massive company that has a direct stake in much of the legislation that runs through this town. They care deeply about sales taxes and Internet regulation and international trade, to name just a few. Amazon already spends millions of dollars lobbying. Now Bezos will own a newspaper with a lot of influence in Washington. How will those interests remain separate?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">DG: Yes, I spoke to him about that at considerable length. He is buying The Post for the right reasons. He is not buying it, as he said in his memo, echoing my grandfather, to serve the private interests of its owner. We did talk over that, and I have every confidence in Jeff&#39;s approach.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">EK: Bezos is buying The Washington Post and some of the company&#39;s other papers, like Express and El Tiempo Latino. But he&#39;s not buying Slate or Foreign Policy or the Root. Why aren&#39;t they in the deal?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: Well, Slate and Foreign Policy and the Root are unrelated businesses. What he bought are related businesses. Since you are in New York, you are missing the most delightful reaction to the purchase, which is in the Express. It says, &quot;Bezos buys Express!&quot; And then in parentheses, it says, &quot;(and the Washington Post, too)&quot;.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So he bought The Post and other businesses closely related to The Post. Express and El Tiempo Latino are printed on our presses. Slate and The Post have always helped each other, but there hasn&#39;t been that kind of relationship. And the Post company, once renamed, is very happy to continue as their owner.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EK: What advice have you given to Bezos? What would you have liked to try in recent years if you had his kinds of resources?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DG: I&#39;ve left most of my cards on the table. Jeff has nothing to learn from me other than what I don&#39;t have to teach him. Respect for The Post, and if you read what he wrote yesterday, his respect can&#39;t be clearer. He knows this is a hard problem. This could be the most exciting problem. Our people and the ideas Jeff and his people will bring, It&#39;s easy for me to overpromise on his behalf, of course, but it will be fun. This will be the most exciting newsroom anywhere. Tell your friends to begin sending their resumes to Marty and Katharine. It&#39;s going to be a great place.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Department of mistakes I wish I hadn&#39;t made: An earlier version of this piece misspelled the first name of Katharine Graham and Katharine Weymouth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130806e986004eh</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_046.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark86">ezra-klein</a><a name="bookmark87">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos is buying The Washington Post. Here&#39;s what you need to know about the sale.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Dylan Matthews 1,515 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As you might have noticed if you&#39;ve read The Washington Post in the past 24 hours, the Graham family has sold us to Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. Here&#39;s what we know about the whole situation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Post is a part of Amazon?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nope. Amazon.com, the huge, publicly traded, Fortune/S&amp;P 500 company, does not own The Washington Post or any of its affiliated publications. Bezos is buying us with his personal fortune rather than through Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So who owns who with the what now?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nash Holdings LLC is buying The Washington Post. Nash Holdings is Jeff Bezos&#39;s personal investment firm, so basically Bezos himself is buying The Post.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How much did Bezos buy The Post for?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$250 million. In cash.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Was that a big expense for him?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not really. Bezos is worth around $25.2 billion, so The Post purchase set him back about 1 percent of his net worth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That being said, if The Post runs losses, Bezos could end up covering them, meaning the expense of owning it would ratchet up considerably. That&#39;s tended to happen when eccentric rich people buy publications. Most famously, Marty Peretz&#39;s ownership of the New Republic proved a very effective way of evaporating his fortune, as he had to cover losses of around $3 million a year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What&#39;s included in that purchase?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The package being sold to Bezos includes The Washington Post&#39;s online and print editions, our daily free paper Express, the weekly Spanish-language paper El Tiempo Latino, the Gazette community papers in Maryland, and some specialty publications like New Homes Guide and Apartment Showcase.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What&#39;s not included in that purchase?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Everything else the Washington Post Co. owns isn&#39;t part of the deal, including the Slate Group (including Slate and The Root), Foreign Policy magazine, The Post&#39;s group of local TV stations, StudentAdvisor, SocialCode and the Kaplan for-profit college/test-prep company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Also we apparently own a cable company, a boiler company and a hospice company, which aren&#39;t included. So we can&#39;t help you with end-of-life care anymore.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">The Washington Post&#39;s physical building, which is on the market, isn&#39;t included in the sale. Is the Washington Post Company still going to be called that?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nope. Reflecting their new Slate-plus-Kaplan-plus-boilers-plus-death business model, they&#39;re getting a new name. What name that is has yet to be determined.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Were the Grahams looking for a buyer or did this come out of nowhere?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Post&#39;s leadership, in particular Post Company CEO Donald Graham, was actively courting buyers, and hired the investment bank Allen &amp; Co., the same firm that managed the sale of Newsweek, to help it do so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Is it changing leadership?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not immediately. Katherine Weymouth is staying on as publisher for the time being, and Graham is staying at the helm of the now smaller Washington Post Co. Marty Baron is staying on as the paper&#39;s editor and no layoffs are planned — at least as far as we know.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How does $250 million stack up to other recent media purchases?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, it&#39;s a great deal more than $70 million, which is what the Boston Globe sold for the other day, and a bit less than $315 million, which is what AOL bought the Huffington Post for in 2011. Then again, the deal doesn&#39;t include our physical headquarters, which the D.C. government assesses as being worth $80 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The newspapers owned by the Tribune Company — which include the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun, and Hartford Courant — were valued at $623 million by Lazard last year. The New York Times has a market capitalization of about $1.8 billion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Is The Post losing money at the moment?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post Co. itself made a profit of $44.7 million last quarter, but the results vary considerably depending on what part of the company you&#39;re looking at. The newspaper division, which includes both the businesses that Bezos is buying as well and other properties like Slate, lost $14.8 million last quarter, though</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$16.8 million in expenses are due to pensions, which are fully funded and thus don&#39;t cut into the company&#39;s cash revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Kaplan unit made $23.7 million last quarter, way up from $3.7 million a year previously, but the real moneymakers are the TV parts of the company. TV broadcasting made $47.7 million last quarter and cable made</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$44.7 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Does Bezos own other businesses outright?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yes. The best-known is probably Blue Origin, his private space company, which is working on a manned, Vertical Takeoff/Verticle Landing rocket for suborbital travel called New Shepard. It&#39;s pretty cool, if we do say so ourselves. Here&#39;s a test video from November 2011, showing its vertical landing capabilities:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">And here&#39;s one from this past October, showcasing its launch escape system, in case something goes awry: In other words, please take us on your space plane, Jeff Bezos.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What other stuff has Bezos invested in?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Besides Nash Holdings and Blue Origin, Bezos also owns an investment company, Bezos Expeditions. That&#39;s invested in startups like Business Insider, Twitter, Linden Labs (the creators of Second Life), 37Signals (which produced Ruby on Rails), and Airbnb. But it&#39;s also done stuff like recover an engine from the Apollo 11 mission from the bottom of the ocean:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He&#39;s also invested in the 10,000 Year Clock Project, which aims to build a mechanical clock that can keep time accurately for ten millennia. The clock was designed by Thinking Machines founder Danny Hillis, and its construction has been spearheaded by the Long Now Foundation, an organization started by Hillis and Stewart Brand (the creator of the Whole Earth Catalog), and named by the musician Brian Eno. The first clock is being built on land in West Texas that Bezos owns, with at least $42 million of his money:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are Bezos&#39;s politics?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like many tech entrepreneurs, Bezos is a libertarian, with laissez-faire views on both social and economic issues. He donated $2.5 million to a successful referendum effort to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington state in 2012, and gave $100,000 to oppose a referendum in 2010 that would have established a tax on income above</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$200,000 (Washington currently doesn&#39;t have any individual income tax). He has donated to the Reason Foundation, which publishes the libertarian periodical Reason.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dave Weigel at Slate notes that he&#39;s donated to both Republicans and Democrats, often in a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">transactional-seeming way. He gave to Slade Gorton, the Republican senator from Washington State, in his 2000 reelection bid, and gave to Maria Cantwell, who defeated Gorton that year, shortly thereafter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What does his philanthropy look like?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apart from stuff like the Clock of the Long Now (see above), Bezos has given to the Museum of History &amp; Industry in Seattle, helped create a neuroscience center at Princeton, his alma mater, and started the Bezos Family Foundation, which runs programs for students like a scholarship to attend the Aspen Ideas Festival and Students Rebuild, a group encouraging global student activism. He&#39;s also donated to various early childhood education charities and to various parts of the education reform movement, including the KIPP and Uncommon Schools networks of charter schools and Teach for America.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are Amazon&#39;s politics like?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As Brad noted, Amazon has a fairly extensive lobbying presence in D.C., having spent $4.7 million in 2011-2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s a lot less than, say, Google (which spent $29 million last session) but still a fair bit. That lobbying includes work on online sales taxes, which Amazon has long opposed but has started backing at the federal level, as a harmonization measure between state policies, as well as on corporate tax reform and Internet regulation, where it&#39;s teamed up with Google, Facebook and Yahoo to form the Internet Association.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has taken a $600 million contract from the CIA to help it with its cloud computing needs; Amazon&#39;s EC2 platform is among the most widely used platform-as-a-service (PaaS) systems that other companies use to power their Web applications, so it&#39;s not surprising that the CIA would reach out. The company has also been clashing with German unions lately, due in large part to an internal aversion to organizing, driven by the belief that unions stifle the kind of speedy innovation that has made Amazon what it is today.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What will Bezos change about The Post?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We don&#39;t know more than he said in his letter to staff, which you can read here.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Update: The original version of this article said Explore Holdings LLC, one of Bezos&#39;s investment firms, was buying the post.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post&#39;s parent company announced Monday that it will sell the newspaper to technology magnate Jeffrey P. Bezos for $250 million in cash. Bezos is one of the wealthiest people in the world and the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com. The deal ends the Graham family&#39;s control of The Post, which has endured for four generations:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Post will not be part of Amazon. Instead, Bezos will own the paper privately. Investors in the paper&#39;s publicly traded parent, The Washington Post Co., saw the deal with Bezos as a windfall:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although Weymouth will remain The Post&#39;s publisher, the sale marks the end of a chapter in the storied relationship between the paper and the Graham family:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The sale of The Post continues a pattern in which private owners have been taking control of media companies in response to changing conditions in the industry:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:max.ehrenfreund@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">Watch Donald Graham discuss the sale below. </a><a href="mailto:max.ehrenfreund@washpost.com" target="_blank">max.ehrenfreund@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130806e986003xq</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_048.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark90">-business</a><a name="bookmark91">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Bezos’s impending buy harks back to days of the wealthy at newspapers’ helms</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Matea Gold 1,168 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Graham family&#39;s decision to sell The Washington Post to Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos underscores the reemergence of wealthy private owners at the helm of major metro dailies as newspapers seek a refuge from the battering they have experienced on Wall Street.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The news of the impending purchase came just days after the New York Times Co. announced that it is selling the Boston Globe to John W. Henry, the principal owner of the Boston Red Sox who made a fortune as a commodities trader. And several billionaires, including the Koch brothers and Eli Broad, have been eyeing the Los Angeles Times, one of the eight newspapers that the Tribune Co. has been preparing for a possible sale.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The mash-up between The Post, a 135-year-old legacy newspaper, and an Internet pioneer was cast Monday as a bet on the future. But it also represented a throwback to the era when rich industrialists controlled major metro dailies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;In the olden days, before newspapers became big corporate interests, they were owned by wealthy individuals because to some degree they made money, but also because they gave them a sense of stature and power in their communities,&quot; said media consultant Alan Mutter. &quot;It&#39;s not so much that we&#39;re going back to some format. It&#39;s that what we had in the post-World War II era was the anomaly. If you go back to colonial days, it was always this way.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In buying The Post, Bezos will be acquiring a newspaper that has been owned by the publicly traded Washington Post Co. — soon to be renamed — and taking it private. With Bezos as its sole owner, the newspaper could be spared the turbulence of Wall Street.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Donald E. Graham, chairman and chief executive of The Post Co., told employees at a town hall meeting Monday afternoon that the Amazon founder offers a path that the current ownership cannot provide.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;As the newspaper business continued to bring up questions to which we have no answers, Katharine and I began to ask ourselves if our small public company was still the best home for the newspaper,&quot; Graham said, referring to Publisher Katharine Weymouth, his niece. &quot;Our revenues had declined seven years in a row. We</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">were certain the paper would survive under our ownership, but we wanted it to do more than that. We wanted it to succeed.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is the urgent challenge for the entire industry, which has undergone a severe contraction in the past two decades as publicly traded newspapers have sought to prop up flagging profits. The retrenchment led to the consolidation of major chains and attracted the investment of private equity firms, many of which cut costs further.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As revenue has continued to fall, influential business leaders have jumped at the chance to scoop up metro dailies at a fraction of the price they were once worth. In 2011, hotel developer Doug Manchester bought the San Diego Union Tribune for $110million. Last year, Philadelphia&#39;s two largest newspapers were sold to a group of regional power brokers and business leaders for $55million. Both transactions triggered consternation about how the new owners would handle coverage of their business interests — a particular source of controversy in San Diego, where Manchester has dramatically remade the paper.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It remains to be seen how comfortable Bezos and his brethren will be with the uncertain revenue their new assets can offer.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They didn&#39;t get rich by absorbing a huge amount of losses,&quot; said Craig Huber, an independent media analyst. &quot;Sustaining tens of millions of dollars in losses year after year could accelerate the cost-cutting. There is no easy answer here to fixing newspapers, otherwise it would have already been done by the current parent companies.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, Bezos&#39;s wealth may allow him to be unconcerned about profits, others noted.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I don&#39;t know if he cares if it makes money,&quot; said Jeffrey Cole, director of USC Annenberg&#39;s Center for the Digital Future. &quot;I think he&#39;s in the business of having influence. I don&#39;t think whether The Washington Post loses or makes $20million is going to be very central to his calculations at all.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">News of the impending ownership change was greeted with a mixture of shock and optimism throughout the industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;It&#39;s as stunning as any industry news I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime,&quot; said Jim Brady, a former executive editor of washingtonpost.com who serves as editor in chief of Digital First Media, which owns 75 dailies. &quot;It&#39;s hard to imagine The Post without the Grahams. From a nostalgia standpoint, it&#39;s incredibly sad.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the move also represents confidence in the future of the business, he added. &quot;I think it shows that someone who really, really understands digital and consumer trends and consumer behavior thinks this is a good business to be in,&quot; Brady said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Amazon founder&#39;s arrival on the scene &quot;is the best news about the newspaper business that I&#39;ve heard in years,&quot; Mutter said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It is the very first time that a true digital native is going to own a newspaper. Heretofore, all the people running newspapers treated them like a 1953 Plymouth: tinkering with them and try to keep them going. What&#39;s really necessary is reinventing the role and the power of a newspaper company in the modern digital era.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That was the theme Bezos struck in a note to the Post staff.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The Internet is transforming almost every element of the news business: shortening news cycles, eroding long-reliable revenue sources, and enabling new kinds of competition, some of which bear little or no</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">news-gathering costs,&quot; he wrote. &quot;There is no map, and charting a path ahead will not be easy. We will need to invent, which means we will need to experiment.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite the hopeful cast of Monday&#39;s announcement, the Grahams&#39; decision to sell reflects a grim reality of the newspaper industry. &quot;Certain parts of the media business are finding it almost impossible to make money anymore,&quot; Cole said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">&quot;I think The Washington Post lucked out,&quot; he added. &quot;This may end up saving the paper.&quot; Other industry watchers said they will be looking to Bezos to do more than that.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If he does do what I hope, which is to experiment and try new things, and if he generously shares his lessons, that could save more than The Post,&quot; said Jeff Jarvis, associate professor and director of the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the City University of New York&#39;s Graduate School of Journalism.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I refuse to believe the only path to saving newspapers is through sugar daddies,&quot; Jarvis added. &quot;Yes, he may have performed an act of philanthropy by saving The Post, but I hope his greatest act is innovation. The world of newspapers will be watching what Jeff Bezos does.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:matea.gold@washpost.com">matea.gold@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130806e986000p1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_049.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark92">-business-technology</a><a name="bookmark93">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to buy The Washington Post: Reactions to the news; The news sent “#wapo” onto Twitter’s list of trending topics in the Washington area, and “Jeff Bezos” onto the list of national trending topics.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 743 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This afternoon, the scuttlebutt in the building was that the big 4:30 p.m. meeting would be about the building. You see, The Washington Post building is up for sale, and everyone who works here has been waiting anxiously to find out where we&#39;ll be working next. Selling The Post&#39;s building was treated like an almost unimaginable upheaval.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, bigger upheavals are possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post is being sold to Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos for $250 million. This comes days after the Boston Globe and Newsweek — a former Post property, by the way — were sold for fractions of their former value.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like everyone else, I&#39;m shocked. Here are a few things worth thinking about, or at least a few things I&#39;m thinking about:</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is not just a case of Bezos looking to buy, it&#39;s a case of the Graham family looking to sell. As Paul Farhi reported, &quot;With extraordinary secrecy, Graham hired the investment firm Allen &amp; Co. to shop the paper, company executives said. Allen&#39;s representatives spoke with a half-dozen potential suitors before the Post Co.&#39;s board settled on Bezos.&quot;</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Don Graham says the decision to sell came from a simple calculation: The Washington Post is a public company, and it doesn&#39;t have infinitely deep pockets. They looked to the future and saw that they&#39;d have to keep cutting. The implication is that Bezos doesn&#39;t have to keep cutting, and won&#39;t keep cutting, though nobody really knows.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post will now be part of a private company, not a public one.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">The Post isn&#39;t being sold to Amazon. It&#39;s being sold to Bezos. He&#39;s buying it as an individual.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to Forbes, Bezos&#39;s net worth is $25.2 billion. That means he&#39;s buying The Post for less than 1 percent of his fortune.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">Also, the Atlantic&#39;s Andrew Golis is right about this:</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">The case for Jeff Bezos, in one tweet</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The case against Jeff Bezos — if you&#39;re a reader of The Post — is that Bezos owns one of the largest and most influential companies in America. Amazon&#39;s political interests extend across everything from state sales taxes to the minimum wage to trade with China. It&#39;s doubtful that Bezos intends to aggressively use The Post to advance Amazon&#39;s legislative goals. But over time, who knows? The Post has had to navigate similar tensions in recent years with our Kaplan division, but this will be of a new scale.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps the other case against Bezos if you&#39;re a local reader of The Post is that its hard to imagine he&#39;s as interested in The Post&#39;s local coverage as the Grahams are. He lives in the state of Washington — not the District</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and has no plans to relocate. That said, if you&#39;re a fan of The Post&#39;s national and international coverage, Bezos&#39;s presumably more national focus is arguably a plus.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">Here&#39;s Jeff Bezos&#39;s letter to The Post&#39;s employees. Here&#39;s Katherine Weymouth&#39;s. Here&#39;s Don Graham&#39;s.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">For now, I&#39;m hopeful.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Related stories:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Post to be sold to Jeff Bezos Jeff Bezos on Post purchase</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">What happened when Jeff Bezos invested in Business Insider?

All Rights Reserved. Well, here&#39;s a story we didn&#39;t expect to be writing today.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is buying The Washington Post. He&#39;s paying $250 million, of his personal funds (we aren&#39;t becoming part of Amazon, in other words, but rather employees of a stand-alone company that Bezos owns).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First things first: Nothing about Wonkblog changes, so far as we know. We&#39;ll be here tomorrow, and the next day, and after the transaction closes in around 60 days, bringing you the latest news and analysis of everything that matters in the worlds of domestic and economic policy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But what does the deal mean for the future of media? That has a more interesting answer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To be part of a publicly-traded company, as the Washington Post newspaper has been since 1971, has always been something of an uncomfortable fit for media companies. Media is a fickle business, offering its owners both responsibilities and rewards that are not easily captured by the fast-moving traders of Wall Street. For the Post Co. and other publicly traded newspaper companies, though, it was a happy enough match for decades, as monopoly newspapers spun off vast profits that started to peter out sometime around the middle of the last decade.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since then to publish the news and make money from doing it is a challenge that many have tried, and few have mastered. Whether Sam Zell buying the Tribune Co. or Sidney Harman and then Barry Diller with Newsweek, the struggles exceed the success stories.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The economics of news have shifted fundamentally. At one time, the great constraint was the physical ability to get information into the hands of readers. If you were a dominant big-city newspaper, you had the printing presses and the distribution network to present a package of information and advertising on every front lawn in town every morning. That was a remarkable power. It had enormous barriers to entry--a competitor couldn&#39;t swoop in and replicate it easily. And it meant that every department store wanting to advertise a sale, every car dealer looking to move cars, and every employer looking to hire a new accountant had to place ads.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Media economics have, of course reversed. Now the great constraint is not on the ability to deliver information, but on the capacity of readers to consume it. Every media organization competes with every other one, and the cost of information is something very nearly free.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The winners in this new world of media economics, if there are any, will be those who are willing to take big financial risks, and endure the possibility that those risks won&#39;t pay off for years, if ever. It is the kind of patience that public companies that report earnings every three months do not have.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff Bezos, with an estimated $25 billion net worth, can afford to be patient, and has demonstrated it year after year in his stewardship of Amazon, which reports terrible profit numbers as it plows money into investing for the future. We at the Washington Post can only hope that has the same inclination, and entrepreneurial juice, as he becomes our boss.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This was not a day any of us on the staff of the Washington Post saw coming. But it is also a shift into a form of ownership that makes a lot of sense given the realities of the business we find ourselves in. I anticipate that large quantities of brown liquor will consumed at the Post Pub tonight. But I also anticipate that the staff will come in</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tomorrow morning, perhaps a bit groggier than usual, and go back to work trying to make the news business work in this complicated, trying media age.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Related stories:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Post to be sold to Jeff Bezos Jeff Bezos on Post purchase Klein: First thoughts on the sale</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Journalism needs a business model.

All Rights Reserved. All,</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I have a most surprising announcement. Our company is making it public right now that we have sold The Washington Post to Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. To be clear, the buyer is not Amazon, but a company owned by Jeff personally. The price is $250 million, and what we are selling includes the weekly papers called, for shorthand, the Gazettes and Robinson Terminal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This leaves me with two questions: Why are we selling, and why to Jeff? The first question is much the harder.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All the Grahams in this room have been proud to know since we were very little that we were part of the family that owned The Washington Post. We have loved the paper, what it stood for, and those who produced it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the point of our ownership has always been that it was supposed to be good for The Post. As the newspaper business continued to bring up questions to which we have no answers, Katharine and I began to ask ourselves if our small public company was still the best home for the newspaper. Our revenues had declined seven years in a row.

All Rights Reserved All,</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I have a most surprising announcement. Our company is making it public right now that we have sold The Washington Post to Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. To be clear, the buyer is not Amazon, but a company owned by Jeff personally. The price is $250 million, and what we are selling includes the weekly papers called, for shorthand, the Gazettes and Robinson Terminal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This leaves me with two questions: Why are we selling, and why to Jeff? The first question is much the harder.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All the Grahams in this room have been proud to know since we were very little that we were part of the family that owned The Washington Post. We have loved the paper, what it stood for, and those who produced it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the point of our ownership has always been that it was supposed to be good for The Post. As the newspaper business continued to bring up questions to which we have no answers, Katharine and I began to ask ourselves if our small public company was still the best home for the newspaper. Our revenues had declined seven years in a row. We had innovated, and to my critical eye our innovations had been quite successful in audience and in quality, but they hadn&#39;t made up for the revenue decline. Our answer had to be cost cuts, and we knew there was a limit to that. We were certain the paper would survive under our ownership, but we wanted it to do more than that. We wanted it to succeed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">WP20130806graham-statement-employees Document WP00000020130806e9860000u</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_054.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark102">ezra-klein</a><a name="bookmark103">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Read this now: Five great articles on Jeff Bezos</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Sarah Kliff 423 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

It&#39;s on track for nearly $7 billion in sales and $400 million in earnings.&quot; Alan Deutschman wrote one of the earlier long-form profiles of Bezos, right after Amazon began to turn a profit. &quot;The man talks in numbered lists,&quot; Deutchsman writes. &quot;He likes to enumerate the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made -- even why he married his wife. The number-one reason for that particular choice: He wanted someone who would be resourceful enough to get him out of a Third World prison (presumably without pointing a gun at a helicopter pilot).&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;People are slowly beginning to realize just how much of the Web is powered by Amazon&#39;s cloud services.&quot; Back in 2011, Wired&#39;s Steven Levy took a long look at Amazon&#39;s growing investments in a massive cloud computing system &quot;which hosts web operations for some of the world&#39;s largest Internet companies—even competitors like Netflix.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;And now this. Amazon could be an unstoppable competitor to big publishing houses.&quot; Brad Stone, currently at work on a book about Bezos, focuses largely on Amazon Publishing, a newly-formed arm of Amazon with a &quot;lofty goal to publish bestselling books by big-name authors.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Specifically, before any discussion begins, members of the team -- including Bezos -- consume six-page printed memos in total silence for as long as 30 minutes.&quot; When Fortune named Bezos the Businessman of the Year for 2012, they did a deep dive into the Amazon founder&#39;s management style. &quot;Like the memos he makes his managers write, his moves are driven by clear thinking and a cohesive vision, even if it takes a while for rivals to figure out Amazon&#39;s motives -- at which point it may be too late,&quot; Adam Lashinsky writes here.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wonkblog and the Switch also have great takes on today&#39;s news!

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a day that my family and I never expected to come. The Washington Post Company is selling the newspaper it has owned and nurtured for eight decades.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to The Washington Post, the company is selling Greater Washington Publishing, the Gazette newspapers, Express, El Tiempo Latino and Robinson Terminal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The buyer is one of America&#39;s great innovators and most respected business leaders, Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer and founder of Amazon.com. Jeff is making this acquisition in his personal capacity and not as part of Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In his own remarks, Don has addressed why the company has made this decision. I want to focus on the future. I firmly believe that today&#39;s announcement represents a remarkable opportunity for us, unique among media companies. In Jeff we have found an owner who believes in The Post as a business but also cares deeply about the role it serves in our society.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff is widely known, of course, as the founder and CEO of Amazon. He is a proven entrepreneur who, like the Graham family and this company, takes the long-term view in his investments. While he expects The Post to remain profitable, his focus is on the essential role that our journalism has on dialogue and the flow of information in our society.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff knows as well as anyone the opportunities that come with revolutionary technology when we understand how to make the most of it. Under his ownership, we will be able to accelerate the pace and quality of innovation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I am incredibly proud of the work that we have done together over the past 5 years, and I know that sentiment is shared by the entire senior management team.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because of your outstanding efforts, The Washington Post newspaper division has made money (excluding restructuring and non-cash expenses) in each of the last three years and in every year except one before that. We are particularly proud that we have been able to do this while maintaining and investing in the quality and ambition of our journalism.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With Jeff as our owner, this is not an end for us but the beginning of an exciting new era. I am sharing separately remarks he has written to you, the employees of The Washington Post. I think you will see in those remarks the kind of owner you will be proud to work for and why we are excited about a future with him.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeff will remain in Seattle. He has asked that I remain as your Publisher and CEO. I am honored to do so. I have asked the entire senior management team to continue in their roles as well. And I hope that you, too, will join us in a future that is filled with opportunity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While I know that an announcement of this sort inevitably causes anxiety and uncertainty, we owe it to our readers and ourselves to make this transition as smooth as possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our mission does not change. Nor do the values that have been at the core of The Post&#39;s enduring strength over many decades. Jeff shares the principles that have guided the Graham family&#39;s proud stewardship of this great news organization.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I will be talking to as many of you as I can over coming days, weeks and months. I know that there will be many questions about what this means for the organization as a whole and for each of you individually. We will do our very best to keep you informed with regular updates as we have news to share.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While we are just beginning the transition process, we have created an initial set of FAQs designed to address many of the questions that will naturally arise. They are attached to this note.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nothing is more important to this company than the people who work here. Be assured that we will never lose sight of that as we open a new chapter in the storied history of this great company.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Warmest, Katharine</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130805e985005sh</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_056.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark106">Editorial-Opinion</a><a name="bookmark107">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Living with Internet retailers</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">409 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 August 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL A18</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

It&#39;s we, the people, who are driving things. Who is going to stop buying popular items at low prices from efficient companies such as Wal-Mart and Amazon.com?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a cash register dealer, I watched my small customers go out of business in the 1970s and &#39;80s. My neighbors complained when the corner hardware store and pharmacy closed in the nearby neighborhood shopping center. I asked whether they shopped there and got answers like, &quot;Oh no, they&#39;re too expensive, I go to the chain store in the new mall.&quot; I then asked, &quot;What did you expect?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The problem, of course, was that larger national chains had so much more buying power. The independents couldn&#39;t buy their wares cheaply enough to compete.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Now along comes the Internet, allowing consumers to stay home and shop with their fingers tapping happily away on their keyboards. The big retailers who crushed our neighborhood grocer and friends are now being crushed by technology, lower warehouse rents and low-cost unskilled labor.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">And why did this happen? Just look in the mirror. l</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Carter Eskew repeated a philosophy that the D.C. Council has recently espoused with regard to Wal-Mart.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the Great Depression eased, most jobs were below the living-wage level of the times. I know my parents&#39; jobs were. My mother worked as a telephone operator for the New York Telephone Co.; my father was a low-level bookkeeper for a sand and gravel company. Together they earned a reasonable living for us. My grandmother essentially raised me, and we lived for a time at my grandmother&#39;s house to save money. But we prospered enough that I was the first in my father&#39;s family to be able to go to college.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If all full-time jobs should pay today&#39;s living wage, there would be fewer of them. Wal-Mart seems certain to open fewer stores in a part of the District that desperately needs jobs if the living-wage law passed by the D.C. Council is not vetoed. These jobs could be filled by multiple family members to achieve a level of combined income that would provide freedom from welfare and afford a degree of financial security.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20130804let-hayman4</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020130804e9840000a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_057.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark108">-business-technology</a><a name="bookmark109">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Justice Department proposes sweeping punishments against Apple; Apple to appeal recommendations, which Justice says will ensure competition and fair prices.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Cecilia Kang 835 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Justice Department on Friday proposed sweeping punishments to Apple for illegally conspiring with publishers to lift e-book prices, asking a federal judge to pry open the firm&#39;s lucrative apps store for competitors and keep a close watch on its practices in movies, music and other business lines.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the government&#39;s recommendations are adopted, an iPhone or iPad user could directly buy e-books from the Amazon Kindle or Barnes and Noble Nook apps — a practice now blocked by Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple would also be forced to scrap current contracts it holds with five major book publishers, and it would be barred from entering new contracts that artificially control prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The DOJ went further to say Apple would be barred from similar agreements with suppliers of &quot;music, movies, television shows or other content that are likely to increase the prices at which Apple&#39;s competitor retailers may sell that content,&quot; Justice said in a news release.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For 10 years, Apple would house a court-appointed monitor to make sure the firm follows through on court remedies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple fought back, saying Friday that the DOJ&#39;s proposals were too heavy-handed. The company vowed to appeal the July decision in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York that found Apple guilty of conspiring with major book publishers to set new prices for e-books. The court found that Apple&#39;s arrangement was designed to force its dominant competitor, Amazon, to lift its prices for digital books. The publishers settled with the Justice Department, which filed its suit in April 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some analysts expect Apple to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Silicon Valley giant&#39;s determination to pursue the case shows how damaging the government&#39;s action can be to Apple as it expands its iTunes business to videos, streaming radio and other services, analysts said. About 10 percent of Apple&#39;s revenues come from its iTunes store, and executives have aggressively pushed for deals with music labels and Hollywood studios to build the business that now competes with Hulu, YouTube, Amazon&#39;s streaming video service and Netflix.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the same time, analysts said the DOJ&#39;s strong proposals highlight a desire by the Obama administration to more closely scrutinize Apple and other Web companies in the burgeoning market for consumer mobile services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The court found that Apple&#39;s illegal conduct deprived consumers of the benefits of e-book price competition and forced them to pay substantially higher prices,&quot; said Bill Baer, assistant attorney general in charge of the DOJ&#39;s antitrust division. &quot;Under the department&#39;s proposed order, Apple&#39;s illegal conduct will cease and Apple and its senior executives will be prevented from conspiring to thwart competition in the future.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2011, Justice said, Apple blocked direct book purchases from Kindle and other competing apps. The company receives 30 percent of revenues from e-book purchases on the iBookstore but not through competitors&#39; popular apps. Today, if iPhone or iPad users want to download a book such as Reza Aslan&#39;s &quot;Zealot&quot; on the Kindle or Nook app, they would have to do so through a desktop computer or through a cumbersome process via mobile Web browser.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Justice said a mandate to link to competitors in the app store would restore competition.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This provision is intended to reset competition among trade e-book retailers and deny Apple the benefits of the conspiracy,&quot; Justice wrote in its filing to District Court Judge Denise Cote.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many of the proposed remedies were expected, but Apple argued that both forcing it to link to competitors and reaching into its contracts with movie, music and television suppliers goes too far.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The proposal &quot;regulates areas of Apple&#39;s business, like the app store and Apple&#39;s relationships with providers of content other than e-books, which bear no relation to the wrongdoing alleged in this case,&quot; Apple&#39;s attorneys argued in their filing to the court. &quot;These overbroad and vague terms violate principles of equity and antitrust law, as well as Apple&#39;s constitutional rights to fair notice of judicial penalties.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antitrust experts said it is not unusual for government actions to include remedies that go beyond the specifics of the initial case.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The policy of Apple&#39;s iTunes business is not at issue in the litigation, but I don&#39;t want to suggest that it is out of bounds,&quot; said Scott Hemphill, a professor at Columbia University Law School. &quot;Here, the DOJ has asserted that price competition has been deeply disadvantaged by Apple&#39;s and the publishers&#39; conduct and they see the apps proposal as a way to jump-start and restore competition where it was stopped for a while.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">The judge will evaluate the proposal by Justice on Aug. 9, as well as Apple&#39;s counter-arguments. </a><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com" target="_blank">cecilia.kang@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130803e9830008f</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_058.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark110">-opinions</a><a name="bookmark111">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Adopting Amazon’s approach to public schools</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">151 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2 August 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

From my experience, such testing does little more for our students than demand memorization and distill learning into an impersonal, quantitative experience.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unfortunately, it seems that The Post&#39;s editorial board [&quot;A healthy trajectory,&quot; July 31] does not share Mr. Milloy&#39;s opinion, as evidenced by its enthusiasm for the measly gains in student achievement the District reported this academic year. Fewer than half of D.C. public school students are proficient in math and reading on exams that demand nothing more than memorization, regurgitation and a bit of careful guesswork? Our children deserve better.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">I stand with Mr. Milloy.

The kind of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">free-thinking entrepreneurs Bezos values most on his &quot;Amazonian&quot; campus might do poorly on the standardized tests that public school students are force-fed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Have backbone, disagree and commit,&quot; Amazon encourages. In all but the very best high schools, that kind of attitude is often quashed. And once quashed, it&#39;s hard to get back. Obedience to the point of subservience, rote learning — that&#39;s what passes for success at many public schools. In a number of big cities, including Washington, some schools have even been accused of teaching to the tests.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I mention Amazon because President Obama gave a jobs speech at the company&#39;s warehouse in Chattanooga, Tenn., on Tuesday. He picked the warehouse because that&#39;s where Amazon has job openings, and that would seem a suitable place for the president to call for more jobs and job training.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the warehouse also has a symbolic downside: The kinds of jobs being offered are perfectly suited for the work-by-rote mind-set that many public schools end up inflicting on students. To work at one of Amazon&#39;s &quot;fulfillment centers,&quot; as warehouses are called, you must be able to read, lift up to 49pounds, work at heights of up to 40 feet, walk or stand for up to 12 hours and &quot;be willing and able to frequently push, pull, squat, bend and reach,&quot; according to the company Web site.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The job has robot written all over it. And while it beats unemployment, there is no future in it. It&#39;s an $11-an-hour gig. At that rate, you could work a 40-hour week for 52 weeks straight and not make half of the $60,000 or so a year that constitutes a middle-class income for a family of four.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Obama would have done better to pick one of the company&#39;s innovation and technology departments as a backdrop, especially since he wants to create &quot;good-paying jobs in high-growth and high-demand industries . . . for today and tomorrow.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jobs in those departments — where the motto is &quot;Invention is in our DNA&quot; — require creative thinking and a willingness to take risks, not a hallmark of today&#39;s public school education.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the first in a series of his &quot;Better Bargain for the Middle Class&quot; speeches last week, Obama cited education as essential for a strong middle class.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century,&quot; he said during the speech in Galesburg, Ill. &quot;If we don&#39;t make this investment, we&#39;ll put our kids, our workers and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades. So we must begin in the earliest years. That&#39;s why I&#39;ll keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available to every 4-year-old in America — not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">High quality, mind you, not just more of the same.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To Bezos, solutions to complex problems are often arrived at in a &quot;messy&quot; way, so he encourages tolerance for teamwork that often appears &quot;chaotic.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In many public schools, students never get a chance to experiment with such styles of problem solving. Many schools no longer offer art. No instrumental music, no choir, no theater and no debate. There&#39;s no money, or no room in the standardized curriculum.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After 12 years of that kind of creative repression, a student is hardly prepared for more than servitude on the bottom rungs of the American economic ladder.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many studies have found that the best predictor of future economic status is the wealth of the parents, not educational achievement. If so, we must make education No. 1 again.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;There is no physical analogy to describe what Amazon is becoming,&quot; Bezos tells his employees. &quot;You have the opportunity to help create the future for one of the world&#39;s most innovative companies.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Bezos can provide opportunities for employees to create a future for Amazon, then we ought to be able to provide students with opportunities to create a future for themselves.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:milloyc@washpost.com">milloyc@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">To read previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/milloy.

Got a bunch of good-looking elves here.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But independent booksellers feel like they&#39;ve been given a lump of coal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even before the president arrived in Chattanooga, the American Booksellers Association (ABA) publicly criticized his choice of venue. &quot;For you to highlight Amazon as a job creator strikes us as greatly misguided,&quot; the ABA said in an open letter. &quot;While Amazon may make news by touting the creation of some 7,000 new warehouse jobs (many of which are seasonal), what is woefully underreported is the number of jobs its practices have cost the economy.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ABA went on to criticize the Seattle-based online retailer for selling books below cost as loss leaders, avoiding sales tax in some states, and causing job losses and budget cuts in towns all across the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Tuesday afternoon, in his speech about creating middle-class jobs, the president held up Amazon as an example of the kind of employer America needs:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Amazon is a great example of what&#39;s possible,&quot; he told hundreds of enthusiastic employees in the warehouse the size of 28 football fields. &quot;What you&#39;re doing here at Amazon with your Career Choice Program pays 95 percent of the tuition for employees who want to earn skills in fields with high demand -- not just, by the way, jobs here at Amazon, but jobs anywhere -- computer-aided design or nursing. I talked to [Amazon chairman] Jeff Bezos yesterday, and he was so proud of the fact that he wants to see every employee at Amazon continually upgrade their skills and improve. And if they&#39;ve got a dream they want to pursue, Amazon wants to help them pursue it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Amazon&#39;s dream is a nightmare for many independent booksellers struggling to compete. After his speech, the president received more criticism from Carrie Obry, executive director of the Midwest Independent Booksellers Association. &quot;We understand this economy is terribly challenging,&quot; Obry wrote in an open letter, &quot;but to deliver your speech at Amazon amounts to an explicit approval of their degrading business practices.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She went on to pitch the battle in starkly personal terms: &quot;As we speak, Amazon is brazenly undercutting the book industry by offering 60 percent discounts on new hardcover titles essentially eliminating the opportunity for an independent bookseller to make that sale. If independent bookstores absorb this hit, who will sell your books, and where will you purchase books for your daughters?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">@RonCharles</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130731e97v002gx</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_061.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark116">post-partisan</a><a name="bookmark117">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Rebuilding a thriving economy</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Carter Eskew 447 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">31 July 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The president traveled to an Amazon fulfillment center today to announce a &quot;grand bargain&quot; where he offered Republicans corporate tax reform in return for their support for a legislative package intended to create middle class jobs. Both ideas have merit, and provide the president with a new economic offensive which he has sorely lacked. But the choice of Amazon as backdrop is an interesting one.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From the consumer perspective, the retailer is magnificent. Who doesn&#39;t love its ease, convenience and breadth of choice? Near instant gratification at a price less than most retailers and without the hassle. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, along with Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and the Google twins, are this generation&#39;s Carnegie, Rockefeller, Ford and Vanderbilt: great pioneers of capitalism.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But from other perspectives, the story is more complex. Bezos&#39; company, which is now moving to dominate cloud computing, is not profitable, despite having a stratospheric market valuation. And while the Amazon business model has so far benefited customers, shareholders and some small businesses that benefit from its vast distribution network, it, along with Wal-Mart, has hastened the demise of thousands of other retail jobs, and placed downward pressure on the earnings in publishing and other creative services. Moreover, it&#39;s fair to ask whether the bulk of its jobs are the kind President Obama would call conducive to a &quot;middle class&quot; life. As Amazon expands and builds out fulfillment centers across America to speed distribution, it is creating a lot of new jobs; 7,000 were announced timed to the President&#39;s visit. Estimates are that these jobs pay an average of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$24,000 a year, or about $26,000 with benefits. The poverty line for a family of four is $25,000, so Amazon&#39;s wages may be a &quot;living&quot; one but not a particularly good one.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The point is not to bash Amazon or to denigrate the people who work hard there, but to comment on how much our economy has changed and how hard it will be to reclaim one where the majority of Americans are thriving, not just surviving. Twenty years ago, the starting wage at a union automobile factory was $17 an hour plus generous benefits. The starting wage at an Amazon warehouse today is about $11 an hour. Into that wage gap has fallen the broken dreams of millions of Americans.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once the most admired companies in America paid strong wages. They were admired for their products and services, for their share value and for their ability to build the middle-class. Today, only two legs of our private sector stool seem steady.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130730e97u0060s</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_062.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark118">-business-technology</a><a name="bookmark119">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon to hire 5,000 for warehouse jobs; The hiring is part of an ambitious growth strategy that has come at a financial cost in the near term.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Cecilia Kang 399 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">29 July 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Apple recently announced that it would make some Mac computers domestically.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some Silicon Valley firms have been criticized in the past for pushing to expand visa programs to bring foreign engineers to the United States, even as they send manufacturing and service-level jobs overseas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s warehouse jobs are full-time positions with benefits including health care, stock awards and retirement savings plans, the company said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re focused on sustained innovation across Amazon and want to help our employees succeed — whether at Amazon or elsewhere,&quot; said Dave Clark, vice president of worldwide operations and customer service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s warehouse hires are part of a long-term strategy to build out its system of distribution centers to more quickly and cheaply deliver orders to consumers. The company has made investments in devices, discount programs, online videos and even robots. Amazon is expected to soon expand its experimental grocery service in Seattle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The firm said it believes the efforts will pay off in long-term growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We are investing for the large opportunity we have in front of us,&quot; Tom Szkutak, Amazon&#39;s chief financial officer, said in a call with reporters last week ahead of the company&#39;s second-quarter earnings report.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the near term, the experiments have been costly. Amazon lost $7million in the quarter, a surprise to analysts who had expected a slight profit.

Citigroup and General Electric have both paid undisclosed amounts to settle the regulator&#39;s claims.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In November, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who is overseeing the UBS suit and most of the other FHFA suits, denied a request by Citigroup, Bank of America and two other banks to dismiss them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon.com reported a second-quarter net loss and issued cautious third-quarter forecasts Thursday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The world&#39;s largest Internet retailer reported a second-quarter net loss of $7 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with a profit of $7 million, or a penny a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $15.70 billion from $12.83 billion in the same period last year. Analysts had expected Amazon to earn 5 cents a share on $15.73 billion in revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is trying to turn itself from an online retailer into a broader technology company, offering consumer gadgets such as tablets and cloud computing services to corporations and governments. It is doing this while expanding in competitive overseas markets such as China.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the third quarter, Amazon forecast revenue of $15.45 billion to $17.15 billion and operating results ranging from a loss of $100 million to a profit of $275 million. Wall Street was looking for third quarter revenue of $17 billion and operating profit of $390 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">l Mortgage rates fell for the second straight week, a welcome sign for home buyers hoping to lock in lower rates that spiked earlier this month. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average on the 30-year loan fell to 4.31 percent. That&#39;s down from 4.37 percent last week but nearly a full percentage point higher than in early May. The rate reached a two-year high of 4.51 percent two weeks ago. The average on the 15-year fixed loan declined to 3.39 percent, down from 3.41 percent last week.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">l GlaxoSmithKline appointed a new executive to head its China pharmaceuticals business amid a bribery investigation by Beijing officials. Herve Gisserot, formerly senior vice president of London-based Glaxo&#39;s European business, replaces Mark Reilly, who will remain part of the company&#39;s senior executive team in London, Glaxo spokesman Simon Steel said Thursday. Reilly will help Glaxo respond to the investigation and support Gisserot during a transition period, Steel said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">l Facebook scored its biggest daily percentage gain ever a day after reporting a huge jump in mobile advertising revenue.

GM&#39;s net income in the second quarter fell to $1.2 billion from $1.5 billion a year earlier, hurt by higher costs related to the rollout of its redesigned full-size pickup trucks and losses in Asia outside of China.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">l 9:55 a.m.: The Reuters-University of Michigan consumer-sentiment index for July is released.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is set to report earnings Thursday, with analysts watching to see if the company can improve its historically thin profit margins.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Part of the firm&#39;s success over the years has depended precisely on those thin profit margins and the promise that Amazon&#39;s investment in infrastructure and hardware will deliver profit over time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Colin Gilli of BGC Partners said in a preview note Wednesday that investors may be running out of patience. The clock is ticking, Gilli said, &quot;for Amazon to show it can sell its goods and services while making a profit&quot; that justifies its market capitalization.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts estimate that the company will report second-quarter earnings of 5 cents per share on $15.73 billion in revenue and a 22 percent growth in sales, according to a poll by Thomson Finance. In the same period last year, the company reported earnings of 1 cent per share on $12.83 billion in revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That fairly rosy forecast indicates that Wall Street expects Amazon has fared better than others in the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-commerce space over the past few months. Last week&#39;s earnings reports from eBay and Google both showed weaker-than-expected sales in Europe.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Looking ahead, Amazon has been aggressive about beefing up its multimedia content. The firm has been striking deals with studios such as Viacom for exclusive content for its Amazon Instant Video service. The move is aimed at enticing more consumers to buy Amazon&#39;s Kindle tablets and at keeping customers who would continue to buy its products.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon investors may also be keeping an ear tuned after chatter that Amazon is considering a move into a new industry altogether — grocery delivery. According to a report from Reuters in June, the firm was plotting a &quot;major roll-out&quot; of grocery services and will expand its AmazonFresh program. That service, which delivers fresh produce to customers, is only available near the firm&#39;s home base in Seattle.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Company shares were up about 3 percent on the upbeat estimates in afternoon trading Thursday, at a share price of $302.36.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com Document WPCOM00020130725e97p005k2</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_065.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark124">arts-post</a><a name="bookmark125">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">&#39;New&#39; releases from Amazon see into the future</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Ron Charles 267 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24 July 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A recent e-mail offer from Amazon reminded me (again) just what a savvy competitor the Seattle-based Internet retailer is.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Based on my purchases and the purchases of other &quot;customers who purchased literary fiction,&quot; Amazon says I &quot;may enjoy these new releases.&quot; The recommended list that follows includes novels by Chuck Palahniuk, Elizabeth Gilbert and William Boyd -- all of which I am, in fact, interested in. (Way to go, algorithms!)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When I clicked through to &quot;learn more,&quot; though, I learned that most of these novels are &quot;new&quot; in the extreme: They won&#39;t be published until October. But just because I can&#39;t read these high-profile novels for months, doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t &quot;pre-order&quot; them now from Amazon, which, of course, is exactly the point.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By pre-selling these big-name novels, Amazon removes even the possibility that you might see and buy a copy in your local bookstore in October. Let local merchants sponsor readings by Elizabeth Gilbert this fall; by that time, her most ardent fans will already have her book in hand. The competition for buyers is over even before it begins.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brick-and-mortar bookstores could offer the same advance sales, of course. But how many of them do? They&#39;re busy trying to sell their current stock -- probably at prices higher than Amazon&#39;s. There&#39;s nothing &quot;new&quot; about that.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unless indie bookstores respond aggressively, it doesn&#39;t take a financial genius to see the end-point of this contest.

Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The event is aimed at promoting the accomplishments of notable women in STEM fields, and encouraging more women to embark on similar career paths.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among those scheduled to attend are Megan Smith, vice president of Google&#39;s X moonshot division; Teresa Carlson, vice president of the worldwide public sector for Amazon Web Services; Donna Harris, co-founder of the D.C.-based 1776; executives from major firms such as Facebook, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, Yahoo/Tumblr and SAP; and chief executives from a number of smaller technology and science firms.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They will be joined by five high-school and rising college students from around the country who have done impressive research in a STEM field. Four of them have applied their skills to medical research.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Britanny Michelle Wegner, a Sarasota, Fla., native who will start at Duke University this year, has created a service that aggregates data from a type of breast cancer biopsy called a &quot;fine-needle aspiration process&quot; that allows biopsies to be taken without surgery. Naomi Shah of Portland, Ore., who will attend Stanford University this fall, is examining the effects of air quality on lung health. Lauren Hodge, of York, Pa., a rising freshman at Carnegie Mellon University, researched the effect that marinade ingredients had on the level of carcinogens in grilled chicken. Lizzy Zhao, a high-schooler in West Linn, Ore., has developed a computer algorithm that scans moles to determine if they are cancerous.

All Rights Reserved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last week, Barnes &amp; Noble announced that the chain&#39;s chief executive, William Lynch, was stepping down. It&#39;s never a good sign for a company when its CEO resigns, leaving it provisionally leaderless. In the case of a struggling chain like Barnes &amp; Noble, it&#39;s enough to make people wonder how long it&#39;ll be until it declares bankruptcy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But headlines, in this case, are deceptive. Lynch&#39;s resignation doesn&#39;t show Barnes &amp; Noble is doomed in the age of Amazon. It shows how Barnes &amp; Noble can survive - as long as it doesn&#39;t try to compete with Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By most accounts, Lynch - the e-commerce executive who took charge of Barnes &amp; Noble three years ago - did everything Wall Street would have wanted to see in a modern-day turnaround. Launching the Nook e-reader and turning over a portion of each store to its promotion sounded like a smart, ambitious way to bearhug the Internet and give consumers what they want. When Borders folded two years ago, its giant rival seemed like the one that might survive in a winner-take-all world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Nook was a surprisingly good piece of hardware, given that it was produced by an aging bookseller. But by June, its revenue was down 34 percent. Despite positive reviews, consumers seemed barely even aware that the Nook existed, preferring to go with the more versatile and better advertised Kindle Fire, Apple iPad and Google Nexus. And it turned out that having an integrated physical and online e-book store didn&#39;t create enough of a sales advantage to beat the robust ecosystems already built into Amazon&#39;s Kindle, Apple&#39;s iTunes and the Google Play store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I think they didn&#39;t figure out enough ways to get the two to work together as one,&quot; said Michael Norris, an analyst with Simba Information, noting Amazon&#39;s boundless content offerings. &quot;Barnes &amp; Noble had a strong book business, and when it came time to offer more content to the e-book consumer, for quite a while they were drawing a blank.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;ve got a teleological conception of new technology as something that eventually drives the old into oblivion, Barnes &amp; Noble is doomed. It sells physical things in a digital world, and other companies are better at selling digital things than it will ever be. Blockbuster and Tower Records essentially disappeared from the face of the Earth, after all, and we should have no illusions that Barnes &amp; Noble won&#39;t go the same way.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even those physical retailers that do survive - such as Apple and clothing stores like the Gap - don&#39;t have the problem of consumers ordering a book they find in a store on their phone for less and having it delivered the same day. And Amazon&#39;s purchase of the bookworm social network Goodreads, as well as its self-publishing platform, have made the Web site a go-to place not just for bargain hunters but also for people who love to write about reading.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s always a Hail Mary to try to beat Amazon, for anybody. And I think they did pretty well for a while there,&quot; said Mike Shatzkin, a digital publishing industry analyst who thinks consumers are moving inexorably towards touch screens. &quot;Before they give up reading printed books, they&#39;ll give up shopping for them at Barnes &amp; Noble.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And, you might ask, who cares? We still have lots of music and movies, after all, and we&#39;ll continue to have books long after bookstores have disappeared.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here&#39;s the thing: Bookstores, more so than movie rental and record stores, are oases in the middle of cities (and even in suburban malls). We go there to kill time, expose ourselves to new stuff, look for a gift without something specific in mind, and maybe pick up something on impulse while we&#39;re there. Even Borders&#39; disorganized warehouses left holes in the urban fabric when they disappeared, and Barnes &amp; Nobles would do the same - they&#39;re a kind of public good, at a time when the public is getting less good at supporting libraries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So is there a way for Barnes &amp; Noble to survive? The answer is yes - in a vastly different form.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There&#39;s a happy story line buried in Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s overall revenue picture. The Nook disaster clouds the fact that the physical stores actually aren&#39;t doing that badly, generating a comfortable $374 million profit in 2013. The chain got a significant bump when Borders closed 399 stores, and it&#39;s now the only national bookstore chain in the country. It&#39;s been shedding unprofitable real estate, letting expensive leases expire and consolidating into the spaces that actually generate revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;When you look at the financials on the retail stores, it&#39;s basically a pretty good business,&quot; said Al Greco, a professor of marketing at Fordham University School of Business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s also got a hidden weapon: the academic market. Barnes &amp; Noble now manages about 700 university bookstores, which are essentially monopolies over high-priced textbooks as well as collegiate merchandise. They&#39;ve been moving into textbook rental and e-books there as well, and the millions of students on financial aid that includes textbooks are more willing to shop local rather than scour the Internet for deals.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, they&#39;ve got an important friend: the publishers, who hate the idea of an all-Amazon world. To help keep the only large physical retailer alive, they might be willing to do things such as offer some inventory on consignment so that the bookstore doesn&#39;t have to eat the cost of unsold books. They could even help offer</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-books with the paper version at cut-rate prices on the Nook, whoever ends up owning it, or open-platform tablets like the Nexus.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company&#39;s management has noticed. Len Riggio, who started the chain and is now back running it, is interested in splitting off the retail stores and taking them private. Without the Nook, the business would get hammered by the markets anyway, so it&#39;s best to avoid them. Absent the pressure of quarterly earnings statements, he might be able to try some radical new ideas, such as drastically shrinking their square footage and offering a smaller selection of books curated by a knowledgeable and passionate staff.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One model that could work is the smaller community franchise. Take the District&#39;s Ace Hardware stores: The owner names each of them after its neighborhood, but the small chain benefits from the buying power and branding of a national distribution network. Barnes &amp; Noble never was a very good tech company, but it does know how to run a bookstore, and bricks and mortar could be its saving grace.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If all else fails and Barnes &amp; Noble really does go into bankruptcy, some analysts think it might be to Amazon&#39;s advantage to keep them alive, even operating them at a loss. It&#39;s already opening physical locations in every state in advance of online sales tax legislation and is free-riding with the showrooming phenomenon. It&#39;s better off with those stores open than not.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And besides, print may be one of those things that never vaporizes entirely, just as newspapers still put out daily editions because they pay the bills. People like giving books as objects, having shelves full of them as decoration, traveling with them and not worrying about them getting stolen. Even in a smaller form, Barnes &amp; Noble could be there to serve them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Will it survive? Yes, it will,&quot; Greco said. &quot;We will still be buying and selling printed books in the U.S. in the year 2020. There will be a decline, but print is not going to disappear.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20130714wonkblog0714</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020130714e97e00039</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_068.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark130">Business</a><a name="bookmark131">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Ruling: Apple colluded to raise e-book prices</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1,138 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14 July 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL G02</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

It was the latest development in an antitrust case that has already led to settlements between the Justice Department and five major publishers. It is also something of a strange case in that, while there is evidence of collusion by the publishers, they were colluding to create more competition. Publishers have a love-hate relationship with Amazon, which, through its Kindle e-book platform and its large share of physical book sales, has an uncomfortable degree of control over the industry. In their negotiations with Apple over making e-books available in iTunes, the publishers may have been violating antitrust law, but it was, ironically, to try to stop Amazon from having monopoly power in the e-book market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wal-Mart, Gap and 15 other major U.S. retailers announced an initiative Wednesday to improve safety conditions in Bangladeshi garment factories after a building collapse in April killed 1,127 workers.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NEW YORK — Apple and the Justice Department on Thursday will wrap up a federal antitrust trial focused on alleged price-fixing of e-books, but with broader implications for Internet companies racing to provide videos, radio and other media offerings over the Web.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After three weeks of testimony from executives of Apple, Amazon and Google and personal insights of late Apple chief executive Steve Jobs, attorneys will deliver five hours of closing statements and field questions from U.S. District Court Judge Denise Cote.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is unclear when Cote will deliver her opinion on the case, but the press office of Manhattan district court on Wednesday afternoon estimated that a typical judge takes about two months to come to a decision.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And that opinion is being closely watched for its potential to set first-time boundaries on Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and other tech giants that have become the most powerful gateways for Internet entertainment, antitrust experts say. And the Obama administration has moved more aggressively to police the Internet industry, largely unfettered of rules, to ensure competition isn&#39;t stifled.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;There are not a lot of cases that get litigated, so a decision will help develop and clarify the state of law for the 21st century economy. It&#39;ll set an important precedent,&quot; said Philip J. Weiser, dean of the University of Colorado law school and a former official at the DOJ.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the heart of the lawsuit are two allegations by the government: Apple wanted to lift prices for e-books, and it facilitated a conspiracy with publishing houses to achieve that goal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple has fiercely denied the allegations, saying it legally pursued deals with publishers and acted similarly to how it created arrangements with music labels and Hollywood studios to sell songs and videos on its massively profitable iTunes store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has promised a dogged legal battle, prepared to appeal if Cote rules against it. Some experts say the case could reach the Supreme Court.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Legal experts question the benefits of such persistence.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Already, the three-week trial has revealed much about the highly secretive company. Testimony by Apple executives and e-mails by Jobs show the business tactics the company pursued to break into a market dominated by Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At first, Jobs didn&#39;t want to sell digital books through the iTunes bookstore, according to Eddy Cue, senior vice president of Internet software and services, in his two days of testimony. But convinced that the iPad would create a rival platform to Amazon&#39;s Kindle, Jobs became deeply involved in the creation of iBooks, from the way pages turned to the look of the iBooks retail platform, Cue said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The DOJ called Cue the &quot;chief ringleader of the conspiracy.&quot; Prosecutors presented evidence of Cue racing to clinch deals with the biggest publishing houses in six weeks between December 2009 and the launch of the iPad on Jan. 27, 2010. According to the evidence, Cue made more than 100 calls to top publishing executives to coordinate a change in how e-books were priced. He flew to New York and sent numerous e-mails to Penguin, HarperCollins, Hachette, Simon &amp; Schuster and Macmillan. All five publishers were also charged by the DOJ with price fixing and have settled with the government.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jobs was intimately involved in the formation of iBooks, and Cue kept the CEO closely informed throughout his negotiations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Steve was nearing the end of life when we launched the iPad. I wanted to be able to get that done in time for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that because it was important to him,&quot; Cue said, in a rare personal note.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To achieve that goal, Apple went along with frustrated publishers who wanted to change the way the whole digital books industry functioned. The book publishers wanted to have more control over prices offered to consumers and proposed an &quot;agency model&quot; where they could determine retail prices and Apple got a 30 percent cut of sales. At the time, Amazon had about a 90 percent share of digital books and set prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key to Apple&#39;s agreement to the new model — and at the center of Justice&#39;s case — were so-called Most Favored Nation clauses that ensured Apple would get matching rates offered to rivals. Justice attorneys argued that the MFN clause in e-books contracts artificially kept prices high because Apple&#39;s rivals weren&#39;t motivated to drop prices below the $12.99 to $14.99 range targeted by iBooks and publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple&#39;s Cue agreed that some prices went up, particularly for best sellers and new releases, which publishers were holding back from Amazon because of its $9.99 price cap.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Wow, we have really lit the fuse on a powder keg,&quot; Jobs wrote in an e-mail to Cue, dated Jan. 30, 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Apple has argued that average e-book prices have gone down. Some economists brush off that notion, saying the most desired books have increased in price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If it settles, Apple could face monetary damages. The five publishers in the original suit have agreed to pay more than $122 million in consumer damages to 33 states that have filed their own civil suits against Apple and the publishers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com">cecilia.kang@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130620e96k00209</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_070.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark134">-business-technology</a><a name="bookmark135">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sony PlayStation 4 pre-orders in high demand; Pre-orders for the PlayStation 4 now carry no guarantee of a launch-day shipment.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 314 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14 June 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

The Sony PlayStation 4 starts at $399, while the Xbox One comes in at $499.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s not clear how many units Sony and Microsoft may have set aside for their pre-order batches.

Justice has called Cue the &quot;ringleader&quot; of Apple&#39;s e-book price-fixing scheme.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to prosecutors, Cue was the chief liaison between Apple — under late founder Steve Jobs — and five publishers, all trying to create a new model for e-book sales that would raise prices above Amazon&#39;s average</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$9.99 offerings.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Prosecutors said Cue coordinated a joint plan for the publishers to move away from Amazon&#39;s wholesale e-books model. Instead, Apple persuaded the publishers to pursue an agency model that would allow the publishers to set prices, according to Justice. Apple would get 30 percent of the agency-model prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All five publishers in the suit have settled with the Justice Department.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple officials and its lawyers have defended its business deal, which they say is legal. Apple has said it is &quot;indifferent&quot; about Amazon&#39;s decision to stay with its wholesale pricing model and about the publishers&#39; agency model. It has said it was an underdog trying to break into a market dominated by Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cue will appear in the Manhattan federal court just days after introducing the much anticipated upgrade of Apple&#39;s mobile operating systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are some key e-mails that prosecutors will ask Cue to explain:</p><ol id="l7"><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Jan. 14, 2010, two weeks before the launch of the iPad, Steve Jobs wrote an e-mail to Cue responding to publishers&#39; request to raise price caps on iBooks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I can live with this, as long as they move Amazon to the agent model too for new releases for the first year. If they don&#39;t, I&#39;m not sure we can be competitive.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Justice attorneys have used that e-mail, which may have been a draft and not sent, as evidence that Apple&#39;s top executives intended to use its negotiations with publishers to force Amazon to adopt the same pricing model and subsequently raise prices, too. Apple will argue that the final e-mail sent by Jobs to Cue didn&#39;t contain language about a desire for Amazon to move to the different model.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Jan. 4 and 5, 2010, Cue sent similar e-mails to the heads of the top five publishers outlining the agency model idea. In those e-mails Cue wrote: &quot;There are several things we have to accomplish in order to sell ebooks at realistic prices . . . all resellers of new titles need to be in an agency model.&quot;</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In e-mails in mid-December 2009, Cue set up phone conversations with executives of Simon &amp; Schuster, MacMillan and Random House. &quot;I want to update you (on) all my findings and thoughts. I have some things I want to run by you. I only need 30 minutes&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Dec. 21, within a 2:15 minute window, he talked to all executives. Justice attorneys have pointed to those calls as a coordinated campaign to collude with the publishers.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Jan. 22 and 23, Cue exchanged e-mails with Penguin executive David Shanks and MacMillan executive John Sargent. In separate messages, the publishing executives asked Cue for updates on Apple&#39;s progress with other publishers to move to agency pricing.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Hey, do you have more in, or still at 3?&quot; Sargent asked.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">&quot;My orders from London.

(NYSE: SAI) is holding up reasonably well. Despite the impact of sequestration, the McLean-based company only saw a marginal 2 percent decrease in revenue for the quarter, compared to 2012. Analysts were expecting a larger drop. SAIC&#39;s quarterly profit of 23 cents a share fell short of expectations, but that also includes one-time costs related to the company&#39;s plan to split itself in two later this year. As expected, SAIC&#39;s backlog of orders has decreased over the past year. Things should stabilize once the industry gets a clearer picture of future Pentagon spending, but SAIC is rewarding its shareholders in the meantime with a special $1-a-share dividend going out this month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Could Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) make a giant stride into Washington next year, crushing grocers such as Giant? Last week, we learned the e-commerce giant is expanding into grocery delivery, and Amazon Fresh could put the squeeze on grocers and services such as Peapod. Granted, the initiative is currently limited to the Seattle area and moving into Los Angeles and San Francisco, but the D.C. area could be a good candidate for one of the 20 other urban markets to target next year. Beyond Giant, Washington has many grocery options, including Safeway (NYSE: SWY), Harris Teeter (Nasdaq: HTSI), Whole Foods Market (Nasdaq: WFM) and Wegmans.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Washignton area residents know competition is harsh, and some hang in better than others. If Amazon stomps into more markets, the blow for middle-of-the-road grocers that don&#39;t put excitement into the shopping experience could be ugly. This is why Amazon shares trade at a premium: It somehow manages to leave a huge footprint in many places and can make life very difficult for rivals.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Summer vacation may not pay off as well as Marriott International (NYSE: MAR) shareholders would like. The stock started June down about 4 percent thanks to a poor report from partner Ryman Hospitality Properties (NYSE: RHP). The chain, whose properties are managed by Marriott, cut full year-guidance for funds from operations - a key measure of hotel profitability - from $3.72 to $3.99 a share to $3.43 to $3.83 a share. Wall Street had been expecting $3.97 a share, the Associated Press reported. For Marriott investors, the worry is that others will duplicate Ryman&#39;s dour results, creating a sort of tailspin effect. Should that keep you out of the stock? Possibly. At more than 20 times earnings, Marriott trades for a significant premium to its sector peers.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon and Viacom announced Tuesday that they&#39;ve signed a deal giving Amazon exclusive rights to a number of kid shows, including &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; and &quot;Go, Diego, Go.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The announcement follows the disappearance from Netflix of the same Viacom content after the two companies decided not to renew their streaming-video partnership. The Amazon deal also includes streaming rights for shows from MTV and Comedy Central, the companies said in a press release, such as &quot;Key &amp; Peele&quot; and &quot;Workaholics.&quot; According to the release, Amazon will be adding more content from Viacom in the near future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has been aggressively padding out its library of digital content as it competes with Netflix, Hulu, Redbox, Google&#39;s Play and YouTube properties and Apple&#39;s iTunes store as consumers&#39; face the increasingly difficult decision about which streaming service deserves their money each month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Deals like this one illustrate exactly how cumbersome those decisions can be: If users sign up for a service because they want to see a particular show or a channel&#39;s lineup of shows, for example, they may eventually find themselves paying for a service that no longer offers the thing they want the most.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Streaming services, then, need to offer the most content possible, and its partnership with Viacom not only helps Amazon in the streaming video market, but also bolsters the company&#39;s efforts to become a regular consumer destination. Amazon bundles its streaming video content into its $79-per-year Amazon Prime service, which gives users free two-day shipping, among other perks. The company has also released less expensive tablets to try to keep users coming to its online store.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like fellow tech titans Apple, Facebook and Google, Amazon is aiming to be a one-stop portal for consumers to organize their media content and other aspects of their lives.

Justice painted the iconic tech leader as the &quot;chief ringleader&quot; of a joint scheme with publishers to raise prices of e-books by $3 to $5 to break Amazon&#39;s dominance and fatten their profits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Jobs can&#39;t be questioned to put his e-mails into context, Apple&#39;s attorneys said. The court would be left to guess what Jobs was thinking in his comments to journalists and in e-mails to publishing executives, they argued.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They selectively quote from Mr. Jobs, then call him the chief ringleader,&quot; Apple attorney Orin Snyder said in opening statements on the first day of the closely watched trial. &quot;The government is asking Your Honor to proceed on a perilous path.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rarely does a federal antitrust suit go to trial, and Apple&#39;s stubborn defense has drawn great interest, offering a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the nation&#39;s tech giants whose innovations have roiled the media and entertainment landscape.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Attorneys from Amazon and Google attended the trial and asked U.S. District Judge Denise Cote to keep sealed documents that could reveal their business secrets. All five publishers in the suit have settled with the Justice Department, but their executives will be called to testify.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A highlight of the case will be the testimony of Apple&#39;s head of iTunes, Eddy Cue, Jobs&#39;s right-hand man on the e-books deals. Cue is scheduled to appear in court June13, and the Justice Department has alleged that Cue executed a plan, approved by Jobs, to persuade publishers to switch from Amazon&#39;s wholesale model of pricing that kept books at $9.99.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jobs was intimately involved in the plan, the government alleges.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The government presented as evidence an e-mail exchange on Jan. 24, 2010, between Jobs and News Corpexecutive James Murdoch. News Corp is the parent company of HarperCollins.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jobs had written, &quot;Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream e-books market at $12.99 and $14.99.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Apple attorney Snyder said that the e-mail was selectively chosen and, in context of the full letter, does not show wrongdoing. In another part of the e-mail, one of 15 e-mails exchanged between Jobs and Murdoch, the late Apple executive appears doubtful about changes to the e-books market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Heck, Amazon is selling these books at $9.99, and who knows maybe they are right and we will fail even at</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$12.99,&quot; Jobs wrote to Murdoch. &quot;But we&#39;re willing to try at the prices we proposed. We are not willing to try at higher prices, because we are pretty sure we&#39;ll all fail.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The government spent more than 11 / 2 hours presenting e-mails, travel itinerary, handwritten notes and phone logs on a slide deck.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At one point, Lawrence Buterman, a lawyer at the Justice Department, highlighted a Wall Street Journal interview from June 2010. When asked by a reporter why anyone would buy an e-book for $14.99 when Amazon was selling them for $9.99, Jobs responded: &quot;That won&#39;t be the case,&quot; adding that &quot;the prices will be the same.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next day, Simon &amp; Schuster&#39;s then-general counsel Elsa Riven sent an e-mail to her chief executive, Carolyn Reidy, calling Jobs&#39;s remarks &quot;incredibly stupid.&quot; Reidy is expected to testify Tuesday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This is not about how large Apple is or a corporate dislike between Apple and Amazon,&quot; Buterman said. &quot;This is a straightforward case of price-fixing.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a pretrial opinion, Cote gave a tentative view, saying that the Justice Department had a strong case. Apple, during opening statements, expressed concern about the judge&#39;s remark.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cote responded: &quot;The deck is not stacked against Apple unless the evidence stacks against Apple.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The question of how heavily the court can consider Jobs&#39;s comments and e-mails may weigh on the three-week proceeding, antitrust experts said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">E-mails are widely accepted as strong evidence, said Keith Hylton, an antitrust expert and professor at the Boston University School of Law.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;In the Microsoft lawsuit, Justice built a large part of its case of e-mails from Bill Gates and other people. So this is really common stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;But the key question is how do you interpret what Jobs said. That is a fair question.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:kangc@washpost.com">kangc@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130603e9630058x</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_076.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark146">-business-technology</a><a name="bookmark147">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Justice Department’s showdown with Apple over e-book pricing is set to enter courtroom; Company is accused of colluding with e-book publishers to set prices; iPad maker says it did noting wrong.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Cecilia Kang 923 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 June 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple will appear Monday before a federal court in a stubborn quest to defend its name and beat down charges that it led a conspiracy to inflate e-book prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And as Apple fiercely protects its own image, the company will work to sully the reputation of its rival Amazon.com.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Justice Department filed suit against Apple and five book publishers in April 2012, accusing them of price fixing in an effort to outflank Amazon in the market for e-books. All five publishers have settled with the government, but Apple has forged on to trial.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon is not implicated in the Justice Department&#39;s suit, but it will be dragged into what is expected to be a prolonged and nasty court battle, analysts say. Apple is seeking to disclose what it describes as incriminating</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-mails that would portray Amazon as a firm that has ignored the interest of consumers. Amazon has argued with the court to keep those documents sealed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;We&#39;re taking a very principled position on this,&quot; Apple chief executive Tim Cook said last week at the All Things D technology conference in California. &quot;We were asked to sign something that says we did do something, and we&#39;re not going to sign something that says we did something we didn&#39;t do. And so we&#39;re going to fight.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple hopes to bring Amazon into what could be a weeks-long hearing at the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, saying documents currently redacted by Amazon are &quot;potentially embarrassing&quot; and show that the retailing giant had also considered the same pricing model that is now under government scrutiny.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple wants to make public what it describes as Amazon&#39;s &quot;internal discussions about the inferiority&quot; of its Kindle e-reader compared with the iPad, according to Apple&#39;s attorneys at the firm O&#39;Melveny &amp; Meyers. &quot;Amazon seeks to shield from public disclosure evidence that undermines&quot; the Justice Department&#39;s case, Apple&#39;s attorneys argued in a letter to Judge Denise Cote last month.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon declined to comment for this article, saying it does not comment on litigation. Justice Department officials declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Apple&#39;s case is the latest effort by the Silicon Valley giant to clear its name in courts and before regulators around the world amid criticism of how it has used patents, tax shelters and commercial deals to protect its dominance in some markets and edge into new businesses such as e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple is notoriously secretive and controlling of its brand and product designs, but it has been forced to pry open its business to the public. It has opened up about its manufacturing and supply chain operations after criticism about working conditions at its Chinese contract factories. It discussed its financial strategies after a Capitol Hill investigation concluded that Apple had set up shell companies in Ireland to shield it from U.S. taxes. In its global war with Samsung over smartphone and tablet design patents, it revealed much about the culture of its design team and clues about future product lines.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Their culture is to say, &#39;If you don&#39;t like what we&#39;re doing, so be it,&#39;&quot; said Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer Federation of America. But it is unclear what the company stands to gain from pursuing litigation, he said, particularly if it loses.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Certain aspects of the Apple model are not very pretty when exposed to the light of day,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last week, Cote said in a pretrial teleconference that the government will &quot;be able to show at trial direct evidence that Apple knowingly participated in and facilitated a conspiracy to raise prices of e-books, and that the circumstantial evidence in the case, including the terms of the agreements, will confirm that,&quot; according to a report by Reuters. She described that view as &quot;tentative,&quot; saying she had read only some of the evidence.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analysts, however, said the comments may reveal a great challenge for Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The five publishers involved in the case — Penguin Group, HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster, Hachette Book Group and MacMillan — were charged with conspiring to create an &quot;agency model&quot; scheme with Apple in which they would have greater control over prices. According to documents filed by the Justice Department, Apple executives — including Steve Jobs, who died in 2011 — met with publishers, exchanged e-mails and had phone conversations setting up a scheme that would lift prices to about $14 to $15 per title from Amazon&#39;s average price of around $10.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The market potential for e-books is enormous, and Apple has tried to attack Amazon&#39;s dominance in selling books through its ubiquitous Kindle device, the Justice Department has argued.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon has about 65 percent of the market share of e-books, followed by Barnes and Noble and then Apple&#39;s iBooks collection.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even with the lawsuit, consumers have not felt much difference, analysts say. Prices have gone down slightly for some titles, according to Forrester Research&#39;s Sarah Rotman Epps, but it is difficult to say whether that is because of the lawsuit or just market forces.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">E-book sales are expected to grow to $12billion in 2017, up from $6.6billion this year, according to Forrester. </a><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com" target="_blank">cecilia.kang@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130602e9620038q</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_077.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark148">-entertainment-tv</a><a name="bookmark149">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon greenlights Trudeau political satire ‘Alpha House’ into full TV series; Garry Trudeau’s ‘Alpha House,’ one of 2 streaming Web-only comedies produced by Amazon, is</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Emily Yahr 1,055 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30 May 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay, it&#39;s been four months, no excuses — you should have finished &quot;House of Cards&quot; by now. If not, the clock&#39;s ticking, because another online-only TV show set in Washington is officially on the way.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Alpha House,&quot; a political satire about four Republican senators who live together in a rowhouse on Capitol Hill, has been ordered to series by Amazon Studios, the company announced Wednesday morning; 13 episodes will air this year and early next year. The studio, a production arm of Amazon.com, performed a nifty experiment about a month ago, posting more than a dozen television pilots — eight comedies and six children&#39;s shows — to its consumer site. It called on customers to give feedback about which pilots they would like to see turned into full-fledged shows that would stream online.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apparently, viewers are fans of middle-aged men living like frat brothers and running the country in their spare time. &quot;Alpha House,&quot; created and written by &quot;Doonesbury&quot; cartoonist Garry Trudeau, was one of just two comedy pilots picked up for a full season.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But does the popularity of Netflix&#39;s &quot;House of Cards&quot; — which attempted to defy TV conventions in releasing all its episodes to its streaming site on the same day — hurt another Washington series on the Internet? Not at all, says executive producer Jonathan Alter. In fact, the Kevin Spacey drama was a huge benefit to the fledgling &quot;Alpha House.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It helped introduce people to the idea of watching online television, and especially online television about politics,&quot; said Alter, a Washington-based writer for Bloomberg News who spent nearly three decades at Newsweek.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The show, based on a real property in the District that has housed a rotation of various Democratic senators for years, has been the brainchild of Trudeau since about 2008. Inspired by a New York Times story about the house, Trudeau originally wrote the pilot for network television, but things didn&#39;t pan out.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last January, Alter, a close friend of Trudeau&#39;s, brought up the idea of resurrecting the abandoned pilot. Trudeau&#39;s response, Alter said, was something along the lines of, &quot;Well, be my guest.&quot; Although Trudeau was unsure about pitching the script to Amazon Studios, Alter said, Alter convinced him that an online series was the way to go.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Having Trudeau&#39;s name attached to the project certainly helped it stand out, Alter said, especially above the thousands of scripts Amazon received when it announced an open call for ideas. But Roy Price, Amazon Studios director, insists that &quot;once you&#39;re on the development slate, it&#39;s all about the material.&quot; Even though certain projects come into the studio in different ways, he said, &quot;I think we apply the same criteria to all the ideas that we look at.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Either way, Price added, studio execs were thrilled when they heard Trudeau, a known political satirist, wanted to do a show about the District. &quot;When it comes to Washington and its foibles and what makes it unique, few people have been more insightful and more knowledgeable than Garry Trudeau,&quot; Price said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alter agrees that Trudeau&#39;s voice was key to the show&#39;s success, along with connections that helped land Bill Murray and Stephen Colbert in small roles in the pilot.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I do think it helped we got those cameos,&quot; Alter said, then paused. &quot;And then it really helped when we got John Goodman.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Goodman plays Gil John Biggs, a brash, unfiltered senator from North Carolina who seems to be the leader of the alpha house. When he&#39;s not making fun of his roommate-colleagues, he&#39;s on the phone with his wife, back in his home district, who&#39;s telling him to step up his game, because the beloved Duke basketball coach is planning to run against him in the next election. Goodman is joined by Clark Johnson, Matt Malloy and Mark Consuelos, who also play Republican senators.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Trudeau went against the political affiliations of the actual house because, he said in a Washington Post interview, Democrats are currently pretty boring, while Republicans &quot;are tearing themselves apart and will be for the foreseeable future.&quot;)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The pilot skewers various aspects of Washington, cracking jokes at the expense of both conservatives and liberals. In one exciting coincidence, Trudeau penned a scene about an epic filibuster years before the 13-hour speech in March by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) . At first, the writers of the show were worried that an all-night filibuster might seem unrealistic; after Paul&#39;s performance, truth proved stranger than fiction, and the scene stayed.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once the crew learned that filming on the Capitol grounds would be next to impossible, they wound up shooting most of the pilot in New York, with exterior shots of the District, including a rowhouse on Maryland Avenue that will stand in for the alpha house. While taking creative license for the comedy, Alter said, they try to keep everything as realistic as possible for eagle-eyed viewers. This means the little details: the bowl of tiny American flag pins the senators keep on hand, low-level staff members sitting against the walls — instead of at the table — in meetings. (It doesn&#39;t stop there: Alter said they&#39;ll be making adjustments in the future on set after he noticed on C-SPAN that the real Senate floor chairs differed slightly from theirs.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the original article that inspired &quot;Alpha House,&quot; housemate Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) was quoted, saying that, in theory, everyone wanted to do a TV show about the unusual living situation, but &quot;then they realize that the story of four middle-aged men, with no sex and violence, is not going to last two weeks.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hearing that quote, Alter laughed. &quot;We&#39;ve addressed the question of sex,&quot; he said, referring to a scene in the pilot in which the newest senator, played by Consuelos, is shown enthusiastically keeping busy during the all-night filibuster at the Capitol.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;And,&quot; Alter added, in case any viewers need more enticement about another political show, &quot;there may actually be some violence that&#39;s coming, too.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:emily.yahr@washpost.com">emily.yahr@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130530e95u000p1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_078.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark150">capital-business</a><a name="bookmark151">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services to add 500 jobs in Fairfax; Workers in new Herndon office to focus on I.T. infrastructure, cloud</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Steven Overly 173 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">29 May 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

We have changed the world, and we are going to continue to change it,&quot; said Margaret O&#39;Mara, associate professor of history at the University of Washington, who has written about the building of Silicon Valley. &quot;It&#39;s also a reflection of robust bank accounts. They have a lot of cash.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Historically, however, when a company becomes preoccupied with the grandeur of its premises, it often signals a high point in its fortunes. These fantastical buildings may end up as little more than costly monuments to vanity and a loss of focus on the core business that made for success in the first place.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking the Apple spaceship is going to get nicknamed the &#39;Death Star&#39; because the project is so big and the timing is so bad,&quot; said hedge fund manager Jeff Matthews of Ram Partners. The building is coming to fruition just as Apple&#39;s product cycles may be maturing, he explained. &quot;It is such a classic contrary indicator that you just get the shakes.&quot; He no longer holds Apple stock.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walter Price, who runs technology investment funds at RCM Capital Management, shares the outlook: &quot;When companies build big headquarters, it&#39;s usually when they&#39;re doing really well and have strong outlooks, and that often coincides with a peak in their stock.&quot; Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are battling to recruit tech talent, and attractive campuses help with that, he added, but Apple&#39;s plan has not gone down well with investors. RCM&#39;s tech funds no longer hold shares.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon&#39;s design, presented to Seattle city planners last week, includes three steel-and-glass spheres almost 100 feet high that will serve as the centerpiece for three skyscrapers that will house a rapidly growing workforce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The plans call for &quot;a series of intersecting spheres with ample space for a wide range of planting material, as well as individuals working alone or in groups.&quot; Amazon declined to comment further.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google, the world&#39;s largest Internet search company, has outgrown its headquarters in Silicon Valley&#39;s Mountain View and is planning to build a 1.1 million-square-foot Googleplex nearby.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bay View, as it is called, will have nine rectangular buildings, horizontally bent, with living roofs surrounded by courtyards and connected by bridges. No employee will be more than a 21/2-minute walk away from any colleague, a design aimed at encouraging collaboration. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment further.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Facebook is taking the collaboration idea a step further, with plans for Facebook West, an addition to its main campus in Menlo Park, Calif., that will be the size of 71/2 football fields.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Facebook hired Gehry to bring his trademark style of unexpected angles and understated drama to what is essentially one enormous open-plan office, where a worker can wander from one end to the other without ever going through a door. The rooftop serves as a park.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An earlier version of the building plan featured flares on the ends of the structure like butterfly wings, but Facebook decided not to go ahead with them, said Rachel Grossman, associate planner for the city of Menlo Park.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Facebook spokesman Tucker Bounds said the expansion will be &quot;extremely cost-effective&quot; and is needed to help the company develop new products for its users. He declined to comment further.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple has the most ambitious idea, a 2.8 million-square-foot glass ring on 176 acres. It would be partly a monument to former chief executive Steve Jobs, who described it as being like a spaceship and was closely involved in the plans before he died in 2011. The project, which could cost up to $5 billion, according to reports, would house about 12,000 employees. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20130528amazon0528</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020130528e95s0001m</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_080.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark154">CapitalBusiness</a><a name="bookmark155">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Web Services to add 500 jobs in Fairfax County</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">- Thomas Heath with Steven Overly Marjorie Censer - Jonathan O&#39;Connell - Associated Press - Bloomberg 940 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">27 May 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL A16</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Peinovich said last week the college had tentatively agreed to sell its 47-acre campus in White Oak to a partnership between Reid Temple African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Housing Opportunities Commission of Montgomery County.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Led by Rev. Lee P. Washington, Reid Temple has grown into one of the largest churches in the country, touting more than 10,000 members at locations in Glenn Dale and on Tech Road in Silver Spring. The Housing Opportunities Commission is a quasi-public organization that provides affordable housing and supportive services.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The property, near the intersection of New Hampshire Avenue and the Capital Beltway, currently includes 10 buildings, including dormitories, classrooms, offices and a 74,000-square-foot conference space.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Peinovich said in an interview that the AFL-CIO-affiliated school planned to relocate to downtown Silver Spring to meet the changing needs of its students. She cautioned that the agreement, a letter of intent, provides a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">months-long period of exclusive negotiations, but falls far short of a final sale.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The pending deal comes after Georgetown University and Montgomery College had expressed interest in the site for expansion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Peinovich said neither school submitted a formal bid for the campus and she was pleased that the college had the opportunity to sell the campus, first built as a Roman Catholic school by the Xaverian Brothers, to organizations with social welfare at heart.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We know that they are not going to tear this down and build a mall or a shopping center,&quot; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A prominent firm in the business of advising big shareholders on how to vote in elections for company directors is paying a $300,000 fine to settle federal civil charges of failing to protect clients&#39; confidential voting information.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Institutional Shareholder Services agreed to the penalty in a settlement announced last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm, based in Rockville, didn&#39;t admit or deny the SEC&#39;s allegations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The SEC said from 2007 to 2012, a former ISS employee gave a vote-gathering firm hired by companies information showing how more than 100 ISS clients planned to vote on ballots for directors. In exchange for getting the information before elections, the SEC said the firm gave the employee about $11,500 in tickets to concerts and sporting events as well as meals and an airline ticket.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ISS, a subsidiary of MSCI , cooperated in the investigation and took action to correct problems, the agency said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The District government sued the Labor Department Monday, seeking to overturn a ruling requiring higher wages for the construction of CityCenterDC as well as possibly other city economic development projects.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Construction on CityCenterDC, a downtown project on the site of the former convention center, had already begun in June 2011 when the Labor Department ruled that developers ought to be paying &quot;prevailing wage&quot; rates under the Davis-Bacon Act.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The inquiry began after the Labor Department received a petition from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council of Carpenters in 2009.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mayor Vincent C. Gray&#39;s administration fought the ruling, with Victor L. Hoskins, deputy mayor for planning and economic development, saying the higher wages could add $20 million to the cost of CityCenter as well as millions more to real estate projects that receive land from the District government.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Charlie Ergen, chairman of satellite-TV provider Dish Network, made a $2 billion bid for radio frequencies from LightSquared, the satellite wireless firm that filed for bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the offer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ergen has offered to buy the spectrum - the frequencies used for wireless communications - even though the Federal Communications Commission has yet to approve its use, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the deal hasn&#39;t been shown to the bankruptcy judge. Reston-based LightSquared filed for bankruptcy last year after regulators blocked approval to build its network on concern it would interfere with global-positioning system signals.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ergen&#39;s bid comes as he also seeks to buy Sprint Nextel. It is a so-called stalking-horse agreement, used in bankruptcy proceedings to establish a minimum price for an asset sale. A stalking-horse bid would have to be approved by the judge before being used to open an auction.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">WP20130527weeklyroundup0527 Document WP00000020130527e95r00045</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_081.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark156">-business-economy</a><a name="bookmark157">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon to create 500 tech-related jobs in Fairfax County; Amazon’s Web Services division plans to add 500 tech-related jobs in Fairfax County.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Thomas Heath 505 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23 May 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Robert F.

An Amazon spokesperson declined to provide more specifics, such as when the jobs would be added.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Western Fairfax and parts of Loudoun County are home to a major telecommunications artery, known as</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MAE-East, that serves as a key Internet hub on the East Coast and connects a growing network of data centers and other technology infrastructure.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Virginia has delivered and has once again stood apart from the other jurisdictions,&quot; said Raul Fernandez, who has been active in local technology circles since the 1990s and is now vice chairman of Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment. &quot;The derivative effect, the other jobs that are created out of these Amazon jobs, will be significant. This adds to the diversification of the employer base in the region.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alhough Amazon Web Services has been expanding its reach into federal agencies in recent years, the company does not rely entirely on the government for revenue. That helps balance Fairfax County&#39;s contractor-heavy economy, especially as sequestration diminishes government spending, said Gerald L. Gordon, the president and chief executive of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">McDonnell approved a $500,000 state grant to assist Amazon&#39;s recruitment and training.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fairfax County agreed to match the state contribution with $500,000 to improve roadways near the firm&#39;s new headquarters, which will require turn lanes to handle increased traffic.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;[When] you get an employer like this, with high-paying jobs, you end up with other companies generally locating around them.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon announced Monday that its Amazon Web Services cloud can now be used for government business, having received a nod from the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FedRAMP&#39;s assessment means that separate agencies do not have to run their own checks of the same cloud framework. The three-year certification lets Amazon boast that its security and other systems are reliable enough to allow the company&#39;s cloud to store sensitive but unclassified government data.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Department of Health and Human Services sponsored Amazon&#39;s assessment through the FedRAMP process, but others can now easily implement the company&#39;s cloud services, said Teresa Carlson, vice president of the worldwide public sector at Amazon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Frank Baitman, chief information officer at HHS, said that the department&#39;s sponsorship of Amazon provides a template for other agencies and companies going through the approval process.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s the beginning of a process that will make it possible for the government to provide services in the way the American public is served best,&quot; Baitman said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Having more companies go through the process, he said, allows the government to &quot;move at Internet speed — which we haven&#39;t done a particularly good job of in the past.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The government introduced a &quot;cloud first&quot; policy in 2010, telling agencies to adopt cloud solutions whenever practical. Several agencies have been using cloud services for some data storage, including cloud-based e-mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The FedRAMP program, which went into effect last year, has been evaluating applications for several other cloud companies. In March, researcher Jennifer Sakole wrote in The Washington Post that about 70 companies are in the pipeline for approval.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloud computing can offer cost-cutting advantages for government agencies by centralizing their processes or giving employees greater access to their work files when out of the office. But, particularly with government data, questions about the security and stability of cloud systems are also top considerations . FedRAMP was tasked with creating baseline standards for agencies to use as they evaluate which cloud providers fit their needs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Carlson said that Amazon expects this nod from the federal government could help the company make its case to the larger business community, especially those that work with the government.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" class="a" target="_blank">&quot;Many commercial companies will look to this federal government process,&quot; she said. </a><a href="mailto:Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com" target="_blank">Hayley.Tsukayama@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130521e95l003pd</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_084.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark162">-business-capitalbusiness</a><a name="bookmark163">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Download: Tech Cocktail, PerspecSys, WegoWise collect investment dollars; Tech Cocktail, PerspecSys, WegoWise raise capital from investors to expand businesses</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">396 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">20 May 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Justice Department accused Apple executives, including its late chief executive Steve Jobs, of leading a conspiracy that raised e-book prices in an attempt to hurt Amazon and other competitors, according to documents filed in federal court Tuesday.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At one point, Eddy Cue, Apple&#39;s lead e-books negotiator, counseled the chief executive of Random House to withhold e-books from Amazon unless it agreed to higher prices, the Justice Department said. Another publisher, Macmillan, would later employ this strategy, Justice said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In its own court filing, Apple vehemently denied allegations of price fixing, saying it brought fresh competition to a market dominated by Amazon. &quot;The evidence proves that Apple acted independently, to further its own legitimate business goals,&quot; the company said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The dueling documents with the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York detail for the first time aspects of the government&#39;s case against Apple. The court is scheduled on June 3 to hear the price-fixing trial that has reverberated beyond the fast-growing digital books market.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As consumers migrate from paper books to e-readers, publishing firms have struggled to maintain profits with discounted version of their works online. Meanwhile, Google, Apple and Barnes &amp; Noble have fought to break into a lucrative market for e-readers and have angled for a cut of the proceeds of selling books through those devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This case has a huge impact on competition as everyday consumers are being hit in the pocketbook when they want to buy e-books,&quot; said David Balto, a former policy director for the Federal Trade Commission. &quot;This not only sets the standards for digital books but also on Internet conduct on retailing. It ensures the Internet prospers and that consumers benefit.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple is the only holdout of the Justice&#39;s lawsuit, originally brought in April 2012 against Apple and five of the country&#39;s major publishing houses: Macmillan, Penguin, HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster and Hachette Book. The publishers have since settled.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In its pretrial arguments, Justice said publishers Hachette and HarperCollins came up with an &quot;agency model&quot; in which publishers rather than retailers would set the prices consumers would pay for e-books.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They had complained that Amazon was setting prices for e-books too low — often at around $9.99 — to attract more buyers of the company&#39;s Kindle e-readers. Through the agency model, publishers allegedly plotted to raise prices to around $12.99 to $14.99.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But they needed a willing technology partner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In December 2009, they met with Apple to adopt their plan. At that point, according to Justice, Apple ran with the idea.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cue played the key role, Justice documents contend. He summarized meetings with publishers for Apple&#39;s late CEO, telling Jobs that publishers, &quot;saw . . . the plus&quot; of the agency model and that it &quot;solves [the] Amazon issue,&quot; Justice quoted him as saying.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company also quoted Jobs as telling biographer Walter Isaacson that Apple had &quot;told the publishers, &#39;We&#39;ll go the agency model, where you set the price, and we get our 30 percent, and yes, the customers pays a little more, but that&#39;s what you want anyway.&#39; &quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those statements, Justice said, demonstrated an illegal scheme that broke antitrust laws and harmed consumers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Apple knew that the plan it was proposing involved a &#39;dramatic business change&#39; for publisher defendants,&quot; Justice wrote in its arguments. &quot;Accordingly, Apple kept each publisher defendant aware that it was orchestrating and coordinating a common approach for all of them.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But Apple argued in its filing that the negotiations between publishers and its technology partners were much more complicated than presented by Justice. The publishers had also talked to firms such as Barnes &amp; Noble about the agency model idea.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apple said Amazon also considered the agency model and spoke in detail to publishers who at one point offered an exclusive arrangement that would cut out Apple.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Amazon knew that the e-book market was on the cusp of some dramatic changes. Apple&#39;s device promised to transform the digital reading experience,&quot; Apple&#39;s documents stated.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We helped transform the eBook market with the introduction of the iBookstore in 2010 bringing consumers an expanded selection of eBooks and delivering innovative new features,&quot; Apple spokesman Tom Nuemayr wrote in an e-mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;The market has been thriving and innovating since Apple&#39;s entry, and we look forward to going to trial to defend ourselves and move forward,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:cecilia.kang@washpost.com">cecilia.kang@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130515e95f000jh</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_086.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark166">post-tech</a><a name="bookmark167">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Circuit: Amazon introduces its own currency, Amazon Coins; Amazon Coins can be spent on apps, games and in-app items.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 544 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13 May 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

They should, because they are using us to expand their databases and hone their algorithms - and, eventually, steal our jobs. This is the startling argument advanced by Jaron Lanier in &quot;Who Owns the Future?,&quot; his eccentric but unconvincing meditation on how the middle classes could survive the menace of digitization.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In Lanier&#39;s utopia, the data we divulge to what he dubs the &quot;Siren Servers&quot; - the likes of Google and Amazon - would earn us &quot;royalties based on creative contributions from a whole lifetime.&quot; We must seize the initiative to make this happen or prepare for &quot;an eventual socialist backlash.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lanier&#39;s proposed scheme - &quot;the only way that democracy and capitalism can be in alignment&quot; - is anything but modest. The title of one of his sections, &quot;It&#39;s All About I,&quot; perfectly captures the book&#39;s hyper-narcissistic tone: &quot;My tale of a talking seagull strikes me as being kitschy and contrived,&quot; a typical sentence begins.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How would Lanier&#39;s grandiose plan work? Whenever Amazon uses our customer history to make a sale or whenever OkCupid matches a couple based on our dating history, we should get a cut - a &quot;nanopayment.&quot; As Google Translate gets smarter while we translate rap lyrics from Maltese to Latin, shouldn&#39;t we get something? Perhaps - let&#39;s just wait for Google Translate to earn Google some money first.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Karl Marx has nothing on Jaron Lanier. In Lanier&#39;s ideal future, we would all be liking in the morning, texting in the afternoon and tweeting in the evening. Robots and 3-D printers would do all the hard work, allowing us to get rich simply by being ourselves. &quot;In a humanistic digital economy,&quot; he writes, &quot;designers will still make a living, even when a dress is sewn in a home by a robot.&quot; And the good news keeps coming: &quot;Someone who wears the dress well might also make a little money inadvertently by popularizing it.&quot; Go ahead: Get yourself another dress and get even richer!</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To account for this lucrative wardrobe, Lanier proposes a system of ubiquitous surveillance, with cameras, databases and all. Since we can&#39;t get any privacy, we might at least get paid. &quot;Commercial rights,&quot; he notes, &quot;are better suited for the multitude of quirky little situations that will come up in real life than new kinds of civil rights along the lines of digital privacy.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Following Lanier&#39;s logic, any correction in the market system - say, price adjustments based on changing demand</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">- would require that extra profits be transferred to consumers. But should you expect a supermarket to send you a check simply because you chose to buy one brand of milk over another? Probably not. Why treat Amazon differently?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To some, the very idea that our every decision is a piece of data to be monetized might seem appalling - and rightly so. What exactly is &quot;humanistic&quot; about Lanier&#39;s vision? Its chief hero seems to be, to borrow a phrase from philosopher Michel Foucault, an &quot;entrepreneur of the self,&quot; always eager to cash in on some personal trivia.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lanier&#39;s proposal raises two questions that he never fully confronts. First, will this scheme actually help the middle class make a decent living once IBM&#39;s Watson starts seeing patients and grading essays? Second, how many of the online services would survive his proposed reforms?</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If the fate of musicians is any guide, the middle class is finished. Spotify already pays musicians based on the number of times their tracks are played; so does YouTube. This works well for big-name celebrities but earns peanuts for unknown artists.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Besides, the kinds of automation that worry Lanier - say, the replacement of cabdrivers by self-driving cars - don&#39;t require human experts to contribute any personal data. Teachers, doctors and cabdrivers actually have it much worse than musicians. Unless cabdrivers have directly contributed to the making of maps used by self-driving cars, it&#39;s hard to see how a royalty-like system can be justified.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The second question - how many services would survive Lanier&#39;s proposed reforms? - further undermines his argument. Take Wikipedia. Why not compensate its authors for every comma they contribute? Well, one reason is that the introduction of monetary incentives would probably affect authors&#39; motivation. Wikipedia the nonprofit attracts far more of them than would Wikipedia the start-up.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While digital evangelists often go overboard in celebrating the anti-commercial spirit of &quot;the sharing economy&quot; and &quot;remix culture,&quot; they do have a point, as scholars working on the sociology of incentives recognized long ago.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lanier&#39;s proposal would infuse all of our digital experiences with the crude commercialism of Groupon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nor does Lanier discuss how his proposed scheme is to coexist with the doctrine of &quot;fair use&quot; - the idea that creators can freely excerpt limited portions of material created by others. Lanier writes that &quot;if a snippet of your video were reused in someone else&#39;s video, you would automatically get a micropayment,&quot; never mentioning that &quot;fair use&quot; is a political choice, not a random outcome of inferior tracking technologies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many companies already do what Lanier is only fantasizing about. A new breed of businesses - data lockers - allows users to charge third parties for accessing their personal data (including genetic information). But there&#39;s not a word about them in the book.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stingy with specifics - he rarely quotes his ideological opponents, opting for constructions like &quot;I am often told&quot; and &quot;I continue to hear fairly often,&quot; and introducing them as the &quot;Pirate Party/Linux/openness crowd&quot; - Lanier eagerly opines on dense economic matters. &quot;Keynes was an unapologetic financial elitist and had no interest in a quest for income equality or a planned economy,&quot; he informs us, without providing a source.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lost in his own brand of digital sophistry, Lanier never gets around to asking how a fully automated society ought to function. Is the idea of education embedded in massive online open courses worth embracing? Is automated journalism - with algorithms churning out trivial news stories - compatible with a democratic society? A clever micropayment system won&#39;t answer these questions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are many simpler ways to protect the middle classes. Pushing technology companies to provide better working conditions - it was only last year that Amazon agreed to install air conditioning in its warehouses - and closing numerous tax loopholes would be a good start. Lanier&#39;s solution, alas, is an odd and unfortunate distraction.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">Evgeny Morozov is the author of &quot;To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism.&quot; WP20130505bw-morozov0505</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020130505e9550001b</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_088.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark170">on-small-business</a><a name="bookmark171">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Small business owners bracing for online sales tax; While internet retail giants such as Amazon support the tax, small business owners are wary.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Mohana Ravindranath 843 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">29 April 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some small business owners running online retail operations have opposed a federal bill that would make it easier for states to collect taxes on online sales transactions involving their residents.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Marketplace Fairness Act, which could come up for a vote in the Senate as early as Wednesday, would force online retailers to collect sales tax for the state they&#39;re shipping to. While most items sold online are technically taxable in most states, in practice, most states only require online retailers to collect sales tax if they have a physical presence in that state. For other sales, the obligation is typically left up to the buyer to report and few states enforce the requirement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By some estimates, the measure could raise as much as $11 billion in tax revenue for state and local governments if passed, and would only apply to businesses taking in more than $1 million in annual revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Weigh in: What&#39;s your take on the online sales tax bill?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shannon Schmidt-Hildago, owner and chief executive of online retail store Green Light Fire Bag, said while some believe the measure would level the playing field between online retailers and their brick and mortar counterparts, it could initially cost her business several thousand dollars to set up systems to keep track of various state taxing schemes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We would have to divert those funds appropriated for employees and marketing to software, managing and tracking these sales taxes to safeguard us,&quot; she said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Her 10-person business, based in Montverde, Fla., sells packs of five eco-friendly campfire kits for $49.99, before a $9.99 shipping charge. Her business has taken in just under $1 million in revenue in total since its founding in 2011, about half of which has come from online orders. She expects to exceed the $1 million-in-sales threshold soon.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re meeting with our attorneys and CPAs as we speak,&quot; she said. She and her team are revisiting their business plan, and are considering reigning in advertising and marketing spending — in any month, the company spends about $2,000 to $10,000 on these areas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We go line by line by what we can chop, from the soap to advertising dollars to our product packaging. It&#39;s all on the table for cost-cutting measures.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She said they&#39;d probably create additional physical distribution channels — increasing sales at campgrounds, for example — and cut back on their online retail if the measure is passed into law.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Others, like Pranav Vora, founder of Washington, D.C.-based menswear line Hugh &amp; Crye, are less concerned. Though 90 percent of the shop&#39;s business is online — the remaining 10 percent comes from its Georgetown store</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vora doesn&#39;t anticipate a huge drop in business, especially since 40 percent of online customers are based in D.C., he said. The business, which makes over $1 million in sales, is currently required to collect D.C. sales taxes because of its presence in the city.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;The great thing for us is that we&#39;re not trading a commodity — we have a brand...Compared to other businesses we might have a little bit of cushion, and there&#39;s not as much concern that a customer is going to another supplier to get them,&quot; Vora said. &quot;If you want a Hugh &amp; Crye shirt, there&#39;s only one place to get it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The measure could, however, introduce a new step to the shop&#39;s system. &quot;My concern with this topic overall is the operational support, and the complexity it requires online,&quot; he said. The site would have to account for different sales taxes in each state if the law were passed, and each state has different laws for which items are taxable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s just one more thing for a small company [to deal with].&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But until he gets more clarity about the timing of the tax&#39;s implementation, Vora said he&#39;ll hold off on getting outside counsel or preparing the site. &quot;I&#39;m in the holding pattern.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For those significantly under the $1 million threshold, the measure is a distant issue. Vivienne So launched her online jewelry business, Zoetik, last month —she expects the proposed tax will only affect her in a couple of years. In its first month, most of Zoetik&#39;s customers are in New York City, where the business is based, and Los Angeles, So said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s definitely something to pay attention to, especially for a smaller business like ours. But it might actually become an advantage for us, because we won&#39;t be affected by this new tax law if it does pass. It could potentially help us grow.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Large online retailers have clashed in their views of the tax — Amazon recently issued a letter supporting the bill and its simplified approach to sales tax, while eBay has opposed its potential burden on small businesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130424e94o00465</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_089.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark172">-business-technology</a><a name="bookmark173">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon may introduce a Kindle TV accessory; Why it’s a smart move for Amazon to move into the smart TV space</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 618 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26 April 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon may be making a major new play for the living room, according to reports that the e-commerce giant is developing a &quot;Kindle TV&quot; set-top box to compete with AppleTV and Roku.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The way we watch television is changing, fast, and Amazon is looking to jump into the fray with its own device that brings its streaming video content to users&#39; televisions, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The device could be introduced this fall, the report said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon already offers free streaming video as a part of its $79 annual Amazon Prime service. Amazon says that the service has more than 36,000 free movies and TV episodes available for its customers. Overall, there are about 150,000 titles available to rent or buy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some Prime customers can already watch Amazon content on their televisions, through Internet hookups or hookups with Microsoft&#39;s Xbox, Nintendo&#39;s Wii U , Sony&#39;s PlayStation 3, as well as through set-top boxes such as the Roku or on some smart televisions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to the Bloomberg report, which cites &quot;three people familiar with the project,&quot; the box is being developed by the company&#39;s Lab126 division and is being led by former Apple, TiVO and Vudu employees.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon spokesman Kinley Pearsall declined to comment on the rumors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Buzz around the rumored Kindle TV box comes ahead of the company&#39;s Thursday earnings report. Analysts expect Amazon to report earnings of around 7 cents per share on $16.1 billion in revenue, according to a survey from Thomson.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The tech giant has seen good success with its past forays into hardware — the Kindle and Kindle Fire tablet. The company&#39;s strategy with the Kindle line has been to offer the devices at very low prices and make money from consumers&#39; content purchases in the long term. Last month, the company dropped the price of its most expensive tablets, the WiFi and 4G versions of its 8.9-inch Kindle Fire, explaining that the cost of making the tablets had fallen as the company has produced more devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Across our business at Amazon, whenever we are able to create cost efficiencies like this, we want to pass the savings along to our customers,&quot; said Amazon&#39;s Kindle vice president, Dave Limp, in a release.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of the end of 2012, the IDC analysis firm reported that Amazon trailed Apple and Samsung in tablet market share, with 11.5 percent of the world market. That was a drop from the previous year, when the company had</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">15.9 percent of the market, which analysts say may have also influenced the decision to drop the top Kindle prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to a report from the New York Times, analysts expect that the company will stick to this same strategy for a set-top box.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The report noted, however, that Amazon would be late to the game. The firm moved into the e-reader and tablet markets when they were relatively fluid. But the market for streaming video is a little more competitive, with dedicated devices like Roku and Apple TV, and stronger pushes from console makers to put more streaming video onto the devices consumers already have plugged into their televisions..</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One way for Amazon to distinguish itself is by offering original programming, a new focus for the firm. The company launched its first original pilot season with more than a dozen shows on Friday. On Monday, the company reported that the new shows accounted for eight of its 10 most-watched titles over the weekend.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130425e94p003bi</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_090.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark174">-business-economy</a><a name="bookmark175">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon, eBay at odds over Senate’s online sales-tax bill; Proposal could require Internet retailers to collect $11 billion in taxes owed to state and local governments</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Max Ehrenfreund 469 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23 April 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Senate is likely to pass a bill allowing states to require online retailers to collect sales taxes. The aim of the proposal is to make it easier for brick-and-mortar businesses to compete with digital ones, writes The Washington Post&#39;s Jia Lynn Yang:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since before the dawn of Internet shopping, the basic rule was that as long as a retailer didn&#39;t have a physical presence in the state where the consumer was shopping, the company wouldn&#39;t have to collect a sales tax.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Technically, shoppers are supposed to track these purchases and then pay the taxes owed in their annual tax filings. Few people, however, do this or are even aware of it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The result: Online retailers have been able to undercut the prices of their non-Internet competitors for years. Over time, shoppers learned that they could browse products in the aisles of a Best Buy, only to click &quot;purchase&quot; on their smartphones for a tax-free deal from an Internet retailer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The proposal could bring state and local governments around $11 billion in revenue, money that is owed under existing law, yet is rarely collected in practice. But the bill has its critics, according to The Post&#39;s J.D. Harrison:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Small business groups and anti-tax conservatives warn that online merchants would face a nearly impossible task of tracking and charging the appropriate sales tax rates for customers who live in any number of the country&#39;s roughly 9,600 state and local taxing jurisdictions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The bill does include an exemption for businesses with less than $1 million in interstate revenue to make it easier for smaller companies to comply, but eBay chief executive officer John Donahue argues that the exemption should be expanded. He asked his company&#39;s customers by e-mail to lobby their legislators to delay the bill&#39;s passage, The Post&#39;s Hayley Tsukayama writes:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The exemption should cover retailers making up to $10 million in out-of-state sales or that have fewer than 50 employees, Donahoe said in the letter.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ten years ago, Choice Hotels unplugged its servers, tossed out its central computers and moved its property-management system onto a cloud.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now the Montgomery County-based company wants to sell the same Internet software to its competitors. Beginning this week, SkyTouch Technology, a new division of Choice Hotels, will begin marketing SkyTouch Hotel OS, a system for property and rate management, to other hotel companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;ve been working on this for years. We already have 5,500 properties up on the cloud, so we know what it takes,&quot; said Stephen P. Joyce, president and chief executive of Choice Hotels. &quot;We&#39;ve had dramatic levels of interest, not just from independent hotels but also from other [hotel] chains.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Choice Hotels, which oversees brands such as Comfort Inn and EconoLodge, is the latest in a string of unconventional businesses that have ventured into the tech world. Seven years ago, Amazon.com paved the way when it started Amazon Web Services. Since then, the online retailer&#39;s cloud-computing arm has grown into what analysts estimate is amultibillion-dollar-a-year business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To Joyce and his team, it seemed like a model that could be replicated. &quot;Other properties have a computer-based server that needs to be cabled, that needs an air conditioner, that needs a tech guy to come in and check it,&quot; Joyce said. &quot;We don&#39;t have any of that, so it is by definition a lower-cost alternative.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But first, how do you turn a 74-year-old hotel company into a technology start-up?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At Choice, the process began in earnest three years ago, when the company started thinking about adapting its internal software system for the broader market. The company nearly doubled the number of employees in its IT division and brought on Ric Leutwyler, a longtime entrepreneur with roots in the hospitality industry, to oversee the transition.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There were other changes, too. SkyTouch employees moved from Choice&#39;s offices in downtown Phoenix into an older, dingier building that used to hold the company&#39;s data center.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;There&#39;s a message here,&quot; Leutwyler said. &quot;We&#39;re saying, &#39;Hey, guys, let&#39;s not think big like abillion-dollar corporation. Let&#39;s think of ourselves as a small start-up that needs to make its own way.&#39; &quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A cumbersome predecessor</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Choice Advantage, the internal precursor to SkyTouch Hotel OS, was created 10 years ago. The company knew it needed an Internet-based program that was less cumbersome and more secure than the system it had been using.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Physically, with the old system, there was a lot of hardware and infrastructure needed at every single hotel,&quot; said Todd Davis, Choice Hotels&#39; chief information officer. &quot;We had deployed 15,000 workstations to 4,000 hotels, and our hotels needed a lot of help managing that technology.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company began shopping around, but there was not anything on the market that would fulfill all of the company&#39;s needs, Davis said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Choice decided to take matters into its own hands. The company spent the next 18 months creating and testing the first iteration of ChoiceAdvantage.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There were two main goals: The system had to be easily accessible with an Internet connection, and it had to be easy to use.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If you&#39;re working at the front desk, you&#39;re checking people in, you&#39;re checking people out,&quot; Joyce said. &quot;The phone is ringing. So you need to be able to do things very quickly and easily, so we&#39;re all about focusing on, what is it that&#39;s going to make that hotel operate more effectively, more efficiently, more profitably?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company tested the software with 56k dial-up Internet service to make sure hotels around the world, even those without high-speed connections, could access the system. They brought in testers from outside the hotel world to make sure commands were intuitive enough to accommodate newcomers in an industry marked by constant turnover.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We would basically bring in anybody from off the street, sit them down in our test lab and say, &#39;Can you check somebody in? Can you check somebody out?&#39; &quot; Davis said. &quot;We&#39;d see what steps they took, how they would navigate. We want it to be so simple that it takes very little training.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Managing rates</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Today, ChoiceAdvantage handles all aspects of a franchisee&#39;s business, from guest check-ins and housekeeping services to billing and finances. Throughout the years, it has become much more sophisticated, Davis said, adding that it is available in four languages and eight countries.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;In the early days, it was: This room is clean. This room is dirty. The sink is leaking,&quot; he said. &quot;Now it automatically assigns rooms to housekeepers based on what floor they&#39;re on, the number of rooms that are dirty, those types of things.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps most helpful, franchisee Praful Patel said, is the system&#39;s rate-management program, which helps him track competitors&#39; nightly rates. The ability to change rates quickly across a number of different Web sites has increased his annual revenue by 10to 20percent, he said. &quot;It&#39;s like the stock market — rates fluctuate on an hourly basis,&quot; said Patel, who owns a Quality Inn &amp; Suites and and EconoLodge in Anaheim. &quot;To be able to capitalize on that is really important. It can literally add hundreds of thousands of dollars to your bottom line.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Joyce would not disclose how much the company has invested in its technology, nor how much it is putting toward SkyTouch, but he said the public company would eventually discuss figures with investors and shareholders. Clients will pay a monthly fee to use the software.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;ve been spending some money on it, and when we launch the company we&#39;ll be spending some more,&quot; he said. &quot;We think this is going to be very positive from an earnings perspective.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Last year, Choice&#39;s Web site had about 100million visitors. Use of its mobile app has tripled in the past year, with nearly 14percent of hotel bookings now being made via smartphones and tablets. Being tuned in is crucial, Joyce said.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is that new reality — a changing industry that relies increasingly on being at the forefront of technology — that Joyce hopes will fuel SkyTouch&#39;s success. But is selling your company&#39;s secret weapon the answer? Is it possible that it could give your competitors too much of a leg up?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Joyce says he doesn&#39;t think so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;In the end, it&#39;s just a technology platform,&quot; he said. &quot;It will perform as your business does — even if you&#39;ve got a great technology platform, you still have to get your own customers and build your own business.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">abha.bhattarai@washingtonpost.com Document WPCOM00020130331e93v003mn</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_093.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark180">Health</a><a name="bookmark181">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now you can scale Mount Everest from the comfort of your smartphone Google Maps Life, but not as we know it &quot;Weird Life&quot; by David Toomey</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maggie Fazeli Fard 424 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2 April 2013</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL E02</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

These include views of the ocean floor&#39;s topography and the Amazon rain forest. The latest additions are panoramic i mages of the world&#39;s highest peaks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The 360-degree views allow users to virtually explore Aconcagua in the Andes, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Mount Elbrus in Russia and Everest&#39;s base camp.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;While there&#39;s nothing quite like standing on the mountain, with Google Maps you can instantly transport yourself to the top of these peaks and enjoy the sights without all of the avalanches, rock slides, crevasses, and dangers from altitude and weather that mountaineers face,&quot; wrote Dan Fredinburg, a member of the expedition team, on Google&#39;s blog.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The images were collected with a digital camera with a fisheye lens and a lightweight tripod. They can be viewed on Google&#39;s Street View Gallery as well as on iPhone and Android devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Scientists, David Toomey writes, used to believe that life could exist only in certain conditions: not too hot and not too cold; not too much pressure or too much salt or too much acid. Like Goldilocks, creatures of all sorts needed their environment to be &quot;just right.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But in the 20th century, scientists began to discover bacteria, microbial algae, fungi and other life-forms that flourish in acid, thrive on nuclear radiation and feed on sulphur - conditions that would be a death sentence for most organisms.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Weird Life: The Search for Life That Is Very, Very Different From Our Own&quot; delves into this hidden universe of life that defies imagination.

Two years ago, Borders filed for bankruptcy; Amazon, the bane of bookstores, has become a formidable publisher, as well; and, among other upheavals, a dispute over financial terms between Barnes &amp; Noble and Simon &amp; Schuster has led the retailer to cut back on orders from the publisher. What does all this mean for the people who work in the industry, from authors to literary agents, publishers and librarians? Style posed that question to several Washingtonians who live by the book.

It&#39;s a hard dream to let go of, even as I watch bookstores go out of business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the past few years of writing my novel, &quot;Seeking Georgia,&quot; I&#39;ve watched the tide turn toward e-books so rapidly that while no one from my original novel-writing group was considering self-publishing, not one of them would rule it out now. I&#39;m on the fence. I&#39;d still like to find an agent, but with the publishing industry in free fall, there&#39;s no guarantee that if I find an agent, she or he can find a publisher for it. I&#39;ve been reluctant to e-pub — I can&#39;t shake the feeling that e-books don&#39;t count in the same way, that they lack that official stamp of approval conferred by a traditional publisher. I feel this way even as I devour self-published e-books I&#39;ve downloaded to read myself.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I picture novelists of the future as the literary equivalent of home brewers, coming up with small batches of craft brews geared toward a specific taste. The challenge for a novelist lies in connecting our work with those readers who have an appetite for it. I&#39;m starting to catch on to the importance of building that base through an online presence. It&#39;s an enormous joke on us writers: Collectively, we&#39;re an almost comically introverted bunch; yet in order to find readers, we&#39;re compelled to morph into crack marketers and self-promoters.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Lanyi is a writer, mom and health-policy analyst. The workshop leader</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hildie Block</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As my students finish writing their books, the conversation turns to next steps. At one time that meant: query letter, list of agents, synopses, chapter summaries, proposals. Now the conversation also includes: e-books, platforms, SEO.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When they return with a revision a year or two later, I start to sound like Mr. Magoo. Constantly, I hear, &quot;But you said . . . &quot; And I reply, &quot;Yes, but that was two years ago.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Then we talk about using social media, and about half of the writers cringe. They&#39;ve been living in wonderful worlds of their own imaginations and thought writing well was its own ticket.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Platform becomes part of the conversation — how to create a presence to help find fans who will buy your books. With a decent platform, the query letter rises to the top of the agent&#39;s slush pile, because if you can sell your book, you become very attractive.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then along comes Amanda Hocking and makes $2 million by self-publishing novels she was writing in her free time — and the conversation shifts again.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Can I just throw this up on Amazon? Should I do an e-book? Should I try to sell this story as an &quot;Amazon Single&quot;? These are the questions I have to design a decision tree to help answer. Yes, putting an e-book up is easy quick</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">it takes about an afternoon. But is it worth it?</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Hocking turns around and signs with St. Martin&#39;s for $4 million, the whole conversation shifts again. Last year, five of my students signed with traditional agents. Because in the end, for now, while writers are writing with a dream of making a living — the reality is that they want that opportunity to walk into a bricks-and-mortar store and visit their book.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most likely, that too, will change. Ask me again in two years.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Block has been leading creative writing workshops in Northern Virginia for 15 years. The writing teacher</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Richard Peabody</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sure, I get students who want to be Stephen King by tomorrow, but others want to join the tribe, want to be part of the lifestyle. There were 13,000 gathered in Boston for the Association of Writers and Writing Programs annual convention in early March. That&#39;s a lot of teachers, publishers, poets and writers. And while the conglomerate book industry aims for bestsellers, I find students who set more realistic standards and want to find alternative ways to get into print. Some are publishing single stories as e-books. Others are buying up antique letterpress equipment and creating beautiful chapbooks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When it comes time to mentor a student, I teach them self-reliance. You must wean them from the workshop process at some point. They have to trust their work. And then I tell them to send it out into the world. Most writers are introverts, and publishing today favors extroverts. By the end of the day in Boston, watching those 13,000 introverts exhausted from glad-handing and being businesslike was fascinating. One thing hasn&#39;t changed — a solitary writer plays with words in a room somewhere. If you understand that nugget, then you may have a future in this crazy biz.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Peabody, editor of the literary magazine Gargoyle, teaches fiction writing for the Johns Hopkins Advanced Academic Program.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">The novelist-entrepreneur Jennifer Miller</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If I told you that a debut novel was named a 2012 &quot;Best Book&quot; by Kirkus Reviews and Self Magazine, and it was called a &quot;must-read&quot; in the pages of O Magazine and Glamour, and it received a fantastic review in this very newspaper, you&#39;d probably be familiar with the title or, at the very least, have noticed it at the bookstore.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Right?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sadly, no. My debut novel, &quot;The Year of the Gadfly,&quot; received the kind of reviews that a young novelist dreams of. But with over 60,000 titles published each year, it&#39;s a basic fact that if your book doesn&#39;t achieve &quot;Gone Girl&quot; status within a month or so, then it&#39;s simply gone.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Which is why I&#39;ve spent the last year fighting to keep my book relevant. I produced a book trailer that featured famous journalists like Brian Williams and Christiane Amanpour. I organized an out-of-pocket three-month book tour last fall, and I invented the Novelade Stand: a lemonade stand for books, in which I set up a sidewalk table with colorful signs, homemade cookies and copies of &quot;Gadfly.&quot; When my paperback launches this May, I will set the record for the most book clubs visited in a month: 100. (Any five or more readers constitutes a book club and will receive one free copy of the novel.) I&#39;ve signed up 40 clubs so far. Only 60 left to go!</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I never anticipated that, when I became a professional writer, I&#39;d also become a marketing strategist, publicist and entrepreneur. But in order to keep being a professional writer, I need to show my publisher how hard I&#39;m willing to work. And I need to connect with my readers in as many creative, absurd and unexpected ways as possible. &quot;The Year of the Gadfly&quot; was seven years in the making, so I can&#39;t let it fade away after just a few months. So visit my next Novelade Stand and help me visit 100 book clubs. And keep an eye out for &quot;The Year of the Gadfly&quot; in paperback, on shelves May 28.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Miller wrote most of her novel in an independent Washington bookstore. The self-published author</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cerece Rennie Murphy</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I am the independently published author of a sci-fi novel trilogy. The first book was released in paperback and e-book in September 2012. Even though I am new to the book industry, I&#39;ve seen so many of the established rules being changed or broken as some new, far-fetched success story emerges. To me, it is an equally scary</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and exciting journey. On one hand, there are more opportunities than ever before to create your art and put it out there, but while it&#39;s tempting to try to be everywhere, I&#39;ve found myself more inclined to focus on a limited number of things that I can do well. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn — everywhere you look as a writer these days, there seems to be someone telling you what you &quot;have&quot; to do to make it. But the biggest lesson I&#39;ve learned in all this turbulence is that there are at least 1,001 ways to get where you want to go. Less than a year ago, I was told that if I couldn&#39;t get an agent, my story would never find an audience. Now, I know that simply isn&#39;t true.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When I was looking for an agent, all I really wanted was someone to save me from all the marketing and logistical hassles of producing and selling a book. I just wanted to be the shy writer and let everyone else take care of me. Today, I am actually grateful I didn&#39;t find one.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Looking back on where I was a year ago, I would have signed almost anything an agent put in front of me. Now, if I ever get the opportunity, I know better. Becoming my own publisher is one the hardest things I&#39;ve ever done, but I value the freedom and control that I have to represent myself and my work.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: justify;">Murphy is the author of &quot;Order of the Seers.&quot; The literary agent</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Raphael Sagalyn</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I could give you the glass-is-half-empty publishing story, from the demise of retail chains to the jawdropping acquisition of Penguin by Random House.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But no, this glass is more than half-full. Books from the mainstream publishers still drive national conversation and keep us up at night, turning pages or swiping screens. Writers still really want a deal with Harper or Crown or Knopf or FSG or S&amp;S or Little Brown. Indie bookstores are thriving. Amazingly good books keep coming and selling amazingly well, from &quot;Gone Girl&quot; to George Saunders, from Daniel Kahneman to Kate Boo.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like every agent, I&#39;m deluged with submissions from the &quot;slush pile&quot; — the aspiring novelist with the next &quot;Da Vinci Code,&quot; the memoirist certain his story is utterly unique and bound to sell. My staff and I browse them, hoping for a jewel. Late last year, we were fortunate to find one: a business visionary with a blog, a &quot;big idea&quot; and a proposal that won a large, six-figure advance. But the barriers to entry have never been higher. And electronic publishing is a fantastic option with fantastic, albeit few, stories of million-dollar success. (To pick one, in case you don&#39;t know it, search &quot;Wool&quot; by Hugh Howey.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One question dominates the conversation in mainstream publishing. Will it sell? Agents make that call every day: Is this an idea and a writer I&#39;ll devote two years of my time to representing? The big-time publishers make similar calls at ed board meetings each week, deciding if this proposal or novel gets &quot;thumbs up&quot; and, if so, for $10,000 or $100,000 or, in Lena Dunham&#39;s case, more than $3 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For &quot;traditional&quot; publishing, it&#39;s a simple but very complicated equation: a writer who passionately believes in his or her work; an agent who says, &quot;I&#39;m with you&quot;; and a publishing company that writes a check, ideally a six-figure one.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As for the retail marketplace, it&#39;s a not so simple question: Will it sell 1,000, 5,000 or 50,000 copies? That&#39;s a subject for another day.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Sagalyn is the managing director of the literary agency ICM/Sagalyn. The publisher</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">David Miller</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For years, book publishers have relied on a rich ecology of media to present authors and their ideas to readers. Magazines, journals, newspapers, radio and television partnered in ways that were mutually beneficial. They needed fresh ideas and voices; we needed audiences to learn about those we were publishing. They had content that fit into books; we had access to channels they did not. Everyone had a clearly defined role, and we all reaped the benefits. The Washington Post was a newspaper, Island Press was a book publisher. End of story.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As we stumble our way through the Great Disruption, we&#39;re learning that the digital world is quite different. The first irony turns out to be that, while &quot;word of mouth&quot; is the holy grail of book-selling, we publishers were never very involved in the conversation. As newspapers, magazines and journals move online, they, too, are focused on connecting closely with readers. Unfortunately, you readers have only so much time and attention to give.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whether it&#39;s Penguin Random House, with thousands of titles aimed at just about every possible audience, or Island Press, with about 40 much more narrowly focused titles, publishers now must connect directly with readers. Increasingly, we need to create word of mouth ourselves.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The second irony is that the ecology of media is becoming a convergence of competitors. If once our products were cozily distinct, when digitized they become frighteningly alike. Newspapers and magazines are able to publish successful e-books without us. The journal Nature recently published an online biology textbook quite successfully without any help. TED isn&#39;t just producing talks, but publishing print and digital books. Say goodbye to that mutually supportive media ecology.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Washington Post was once a newspaper. Island Press was once a book publisher. What we are all becoming isn&#39;t nearly as clear as it used to be.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Miller is the senior vice president and publisher of Island Press. The bookseller</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mark LaFramboise</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From the perspective of an independent bookstore, I don&#39;t think the pressures of the marketplace are very different than they&#39;ve been for a long time. We saw the advent of the big-box superstore, online discounters and, now, e-publishing. Change, amounting to added pressure, has been ever-present.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Technology has made it cheaper and easier for self-published authors to introduce their work, but only a very few have made noticeable impact on a large scale. That same technology, though, has made available publishers&#39; backlist titles as well as many &quot;out of print&quot; titles people are still looking for. Many can be printed fully bound in the store. That, I think, is a truly revolutionary development that is only beginning to be realized.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While we don&#39;t have the same market penetration as the brand name e-book retailers, independent bookstores can (and most of us do) sell e-books from our Web sites. This is important, because many of our customers enjoy the convenience of e-readers but also want to support us. It&#39;s this customer loyalty that we can never take for granted and have to constantly keep in mind as we offer programs, classes, trips, author events and anything else that can&#39;t be fulfilled by a national chain or an e-retailer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Social media has had an effect on promotion, but I confess it&#39;s still pretty mysterious to me. When Deb Perelman came to [Politics &amp; Prose] to promote her &quot;Smitten Kitchen Cookbook,&quot; we expected a good audience, but we were overwhelmed by nearly a thousand people trying to come into the store. Why does social media sometimes create a sensation and sometimes fall flat? I haven&#39;t a clue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While we can&#39;t ignore the trends, it&#39;s most important that we continue to just be a great bookstore, providing friendly and intelligent service, offering a rich and diverse events calendar, stocking the titles our customers expect, as well as others that challenge and inspire.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: justify;">LaFramboise is responsible for buying most of the adult titles at Politics &amp; Prose Bookstore. The book reviewer</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mark Athitakis</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For nearly a decade, I&#39;ve been reviewing books, almost always with a pen or pencil in my hand, ready to underline a sentence, scribble a margin note or, if I&#39;m particularly struck by something, dash off a trio of exclamation points. I don&#39;t think of this as something I do in addition to reading — it&#39;s how I read. So something always feels a little off when I read a book on my Kindle or iPad. There&#39;s a lot to like about e-books; my aging eyes particularly appreciate the ability to increase font size. But note-taking on the Kindle is cumbersome at best,</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and I&#39;ve yet to [use] an iPad book app that facilitates it. E-books promise all sorts of frictionless interactivity, except the one I really want.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Note-taking is just one problem. Books aren&#39;t just in conversation with readers but with themselves: What happens on page 362 harks back to something on page 15 that foreshadows events on page 144. Noticing these connections is part of my work, and it wasn&#39;t until I began reading e-books that I realized how much bouncing back and forth I do in a physical book, something e-books don&#39;t easily facilitate. Readers enthuse about being immersed in a good book, but e-book progress bars encourage us to read only one way: straight ahead, at a sprint. It&#39;s unnatural.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I don&#39;t trust the e-books I own to last — technology and business interests shift too much to convince me that the bundle of pixels I bought two years ago will be accessible a decade from now. I can&#39;t read an e-book without thinking about its impermanence, its disposability. But that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. It raises the book reviewer&#39;s age-old question with more insistence: Is this book built to last?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Athitakis, who blogs about fiction at markathitakis.com, has contributed reviews to The Post. The academic librarian</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tina Plottel</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I notice that patrons become frustrated when they can see that a library owns a particular e-book, but that it&#39;s &quot;checked out&quot; and they have to wait. Or, another example: An academic library will license an e-book, but since that material can only be used by members of that particular institution, services on which patrons rely, like Interlibrary Loan (provided by most academic libraries who share resources) are not applicable. The model for e-books isn&#39;t anytime, anyplace, anywhere; it&#39;s fairly limited to users who meet very specific criteria.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The tradition of libraries is equitable access. E-books illustrate the exact opposite. I hope their use forces people to think about aspects of access they&#39;ve never had to confront before — that they recognize there&#39;s a huge difference between a printed book that can be read by everyone and an e-book that&#39;s only accessible to privileged people.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Plottel is a reference and instruction librarian at George Washington University&#39;s Gelman Library. The librarian</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ginnie Cooper</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In many ways, this is the best of times for the D.C. Public Library. More people are using the libraries than ever before. They are borrowing more books and other library materials in record numbers. They are coming to programs for children, using the library&#39;s Web site and electronic books and materials. People are finding what they want and need at the library.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While many who come to the library are looking for books printed on paper, others are now looking for a DVD or an audiobook. They visit their library over the Internet to download an e-book to read or an audiobook to hear. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library had 199,263 items checked out in the first quarter of our fiscal year. Our busiest neighborhood library had 54,319 items checked out. Our digital library — the place we house all of our e-books — had 73, 224 titles downloaded.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The change in books is but the most recent in a long series of changes in how libraries are used. Once, people came to their library to get what was on the shelf; now, they come to get books that are on the shelf and exist in digital form. Librarians help people find information in books; now, we also help people find information online. Libraries used to have story times for quiet 4-year-olds; now, we also welcome infants and their parents, because we know reading to babies gets them ready to learn. We hire librarians who are trained to love books and also know how to navigate computer databases. It is a standard part of library science now.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The challenge for libraries today is to serve those who want what libraries have traditionally provided while welcoming those who seek books and information in the format they want. Public libraries in the U.S. and in D.C. have always strived to have what people want and need. That will not change.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Cooper is the chief librarian of the District.

The case, combining the Amazon and Overstock suits, was decided by the New York State Court of Appeals by a vote of 4 to 1.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s unfortunate, and the [U.S.] Supreme Court ought to look at this,&quot; Overstock acting chief executive Jonathan Johnson said in an interview. &quot;We have states saying different things,&quot; he said, citing a ruling by the Illinois Supreme Court that a similar tax was not permissible.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The U.S. Supreme Court typically accepts cases on which lower courts issue conflicting opinions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The ruling by the New York Court of Appeals conflicts with both the U.S. Supreme Court&#39;s precedents and with contrary decisions by other state courts that have looked at the same issue,&quot; an Amazon spokesman said by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The best solution to that conflict, he said, would be passage of federal legislation currently under consideration that would allow any state to require tax collection.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">New York State Commissioner of Taxation and Finance Thomas Mattox commended the court for &quot;recognizing the logical application of existing precedent to the 21st-century economy.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eight other states have passed legislation similar to New York&#39;s, which requires out-of-state retailers to collect sales tax even when they do not have a physical presence in the state but do have affiliates in the state.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In recent years, as online sales have grown as a portion of the retail market, Amazon has agreed to begin collecting sales taxes in California, Texas, New Jersey and some other states where it has distribution facilities or plans to build them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WP20130329amazon0329</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WP00000020130329e93t0000f</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_096.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark186">/business/technology</a><a name="bookmark187">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon adds ‘Send to Kindle’ button to sites; Amazon is joining the “save now, read later” crowd with a button that will send Web content to your Kindle</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 362 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">20 March 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Apple&#39;s Safari browser also has a &quot;reading list&quot; feature that lets users keep track of sites they want to take a look at later.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the one hand, Amazon has an advantage here if many Web sites adopt the button and allow the company to leverage its broad userbase. Even without rich organization and tagging options, that fact alone could drive use of the &quot;Send to Kindle&quot; button.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google has also reportedly been working on a service that lets users save notes for later. Sharp-eyed bloggers at Android Police noticed a note-taking app called Google Keep that appeared in Google Drive briefly over the weekend — the site was quickly taken down after the blog&#39;s report went live.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has experimented in the past with similar services, as TechCrunch&#39;s Sarah Perez noted Monday, such as Google Notebook and Google Bookmark Lists, both of which were subsequently shut down.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130320e93k005bq</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_097.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark188">/business/technology</a><a name="bookmark189">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google said to prep e-commerce push; Google is said to be planning a same-day delivery service, Amazon Prime competitor</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Hayley Tsukayama 466 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 March 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google may be planning to take on Amazon in the e-commerce space, according to a TechCrunch report that claims the company is working on a discounted same-day shipping service that would take on Amazon&#39;s Prime program, as well as similar efforts from eBay and Wal-Mart.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amazon Prime members receive free two-day shipping for $79 per year; TechCrunch&#39;s report indicates Google&#39;s service would cost between $10 to $15 less.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a statement, a Google spokesman said the company has nothing to announce at this time, but that it is continuing its work on retail products and partnerships with retailers.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Strengthening its e-commerce push would put the company in a strong position to capitalize off strong growth in online sales, which recently saw a record holiday season, and is expected to grow between 9 percent and 12 percent in 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TechCrunch doesn&#39;t have all the details about how the system may work, but does suggest that the service would act as a central destination for existing Google commerce moves such as Google Shopping and the check-out features of Google Wallet, which unifies a payment system for buying apps, movies and books across the Google ecosystem.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That could mean the company will emulate the model set by eBay&#39;s Now service, which partners with area retailers such as Target and Best Buy to give users a limited range of goods that can be delivered anywhere they are — their homes, workplaces or even while out and about. The company originally limited the service to San Francisco, but has expanded into San Jose, Calif., and New York.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Or, given the company&#39;s recent acquisition of the firm BufferBox — a Canadian start-up that lets online shoppers pick up their packages from storage lockers. Amazon uses a similar system, Amazon Locker , in certain areas to give shoppers an alternative option to having packages left on their doorsteps.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Google has made some strides into e-commerce in the past, with services such as its Google Offers daily-deals service and in mobile payments with its Google Wallet app, which lets customers reach for their phones to pay for something instead of their wallets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The company has reportedly been reorganizing its payments department over the past year. In January 2012, All Things Digital noted that the company&#39;s vice-president of commerce and PayPal alum Stephanie Tilenius had switched her focus to overseeing the company&#39;s global commerce efforts. The TechCrunch report says that the effort is being spearheaded within the company by Tom Fallows, the company&#39;s e-commerce product manager.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:tsukayamah@washpost.com">tsukayamah@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130305e935003mn</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_098.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark190">arts-post</a><a name="bookmark191">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Amazon website down briefly Friday afternoon</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Ron Charles 122 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 March 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

Amazon recently renewed a contract with Patton Boggs to lobby for the Marketplace Fairness Act, a Senate bill introduced in the last Congress that would have given states the authority to require remote sellers like Amazon and eBay to collect sales tax on goods sold online. The Seattle-based retailer retained Patton Boggs in November and paid the firm $130,000 last year to lobby on the bill, but the activity was not reported until late January, the deadline to submit lobbying activity for the previous quarter. The Marketplace Fairness Act, which did not pass, has yet to be reintroduced in the current Congress. Amazon was joined by Target and Wal-Mart in support of the bill; eBay and Overstock.com have opposed it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Urban Outfitters is venturing into federal lobbying for the first time. The Philadelphia-based fashion retailer hired Abraham &amp; Roetzel in late January to lobby on federal policy involving economic and urban development, according to lobbying registration records. The three lobbyists are the firm&#39;s president Bob Carey, former legislative director for Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.); Lou Crocco, a former senior staffer in the Pennsylvania House; and Kimberly Contino, a former staffer in the Pennsylvania Senate. Neither Carey nor a spokeswoman for Urban Outfitters returned requests for comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Iron Mountain, an information management services provider that handles document shredding and other data management, hired Efrus Federal Advisors this month to lobby the government on records management and consult on business development. A representative for the Boston-based company said they are advocating for data privacy laws that protect consumers and businesses, and seeking to lend expertise in the government&#39;s ongoing quest to protect data and migrate to electronic records. Iron Mountain previously has paid tens of thousands of dollars to outside firms to lobby on electronic health records and data privacy issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Business Roundtable is adding to its army of federal lobbyists, this month retaining Podesta Group to lobby on corporate tax issues. In 2012, the Washington-based trade association that represents CEOs of U.S. corporations spent $13.9 million — up from $12.3 million in 2011 — to lobby on a wide range of issues including taxes, energy, finance and health.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:hoc@washpost.com">hoc@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130211e92b0005l</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_100.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark194">CapitalBusiness</a><a name="bookmark195">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">NVTC panel to discuss cloud computing and government issues</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">426 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11 February 2013 The Washington Post WP</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FINAL A02</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

All Rights Reserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consumers may someday be able to buy and sell old e-books, apps and songs the same way campus bookstores sell used textbooks — at least if an Amazon patent ever comes to life.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The patent, which Amazon filed in 2009 and won on Jan. 29, imagines a digital resale marketplace where users can trade &quot;digital objects&quot; like e-books, songs, videos and apps. According to the patent, these items would live in the user&#39;s &quot;personalized data store,&quot; presumably in the cloud. Selling a song would copy it to another user&#39;s data store and delete it from the original owner&#39;s.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The patent doesn&#39;t mean such a marketplace is coming anytime soon — or at all — but it does show Amazon&#39;s interest in wading into the contentious muck of digital resale rights.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to a recent PaidContent report, consumers and publishers have contested the right to buy and sell &quot;used&quot; digital items for more than a decade, when the Patent Office addressed the issue in a congressional report (PDF). On one hand, many consumers and middlemen argue that if &quot;you bought it, you own it&quot; — and you should be able to share it, like a tangible book or song. On the other hand, music labels and publishers fear resale rights will erode their sales and profits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At least two high-profile digital rights cases are before the courts right now, with verdicts expected later this year. Library associations have been active in Kirtsaeng vs. Wiley, a Supreme Court case weighing the rights of the buyers of copyrighted works. (Foreign books, in this case, though libraries also face tough restrictions around</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e-book lending.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In another case, the digital music start-up ReDigi was sued by EMI, which claims ReDigi&#39;s &quot;online marketplace for used digital music&quot; violated copyrights. ReDigi claims it takes extensive steps to protect against copyright abuse.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a statement today, ReDigi said &quot;the Amazon patent is further proof that the secondary market is the future of the digital space,&quot; but implied that its marketplace was more copyright-friendly than Amazon&#39;s.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That could matter in the future. Some industry-watchers, such as PaidContent&#39;s Laura Hazard Owen, have suggested that Amazon&#39;s patent prove problematic for ReDigi. And the outcome of the ReDigi case, will likely impact Amazon&#39;s resale marketplace plans.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;ReDigi takes no position on the legality of this technique under copyright law,&quot; the statement says, referring to Amazon&#39;s copy-and-delete transfer patent, &quot;but simply notes that it has been central to the music and publishing industries&#39; skepticism and opposition to a &#39;used&#39; digital marketplace, and that the ReDigi Marketplace does not use this technique.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ironically, Amazon had a hand in starting the brouhaha over digital resale rights. According to Bill Rosenblatt, a consultant who has written widely on digital rights management, the issue flared up recently because retailers have made shareable music the norm. Amazon was an early proponent of rights-free music — it announced the launch of a DRM-free store in May 2007.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Music buyers can return to treating their purchases as their property — reselling as they see fit or passing them on to their heirs,&quot; one Post reporter wrote hopefully at the time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But six years later, Amazon appears only inches closer to that goal.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:caitlin.dewey@washpost.com">caitlin.dewey@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document WPCOM00020130206e926006sm</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="254" height="38" alt="image" src="WP 12-13 1/Image_102.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark198">/business/economy</a><a name="bookmark199">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LivingSocial records net loss of $650 million for 2012; Recent revenue figures put a cap on twelve months that brought net losses, employee layoffs</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Steven Overly 637 words</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">31 January 2013 Washington Post.com WPCOM</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">English</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.

The company closed some overseas operations, wrote down the value of others, reshuffled its executive ranks and let go 10percent of its workforce.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The financial results were reported in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from online retailer Amazon.com, which owns 29percent of the firm. As a private company, LivingSocial does not disclose its own financial figures.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amazon said in the filing that the book value of its LivingSocial investment was $52million as of Dec.31. Amazon has invested as much as $200million in the company during its period of speedy growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LivingSocial declined to comment on the filings. In an interview in December after the job cuts, LivingSocial spokesman Andrew Weinstein said, &quot;We&#39;ve had three years of extraordinary, nearly unprecedented growth, and this is a natural step to take a pause and make sure we are positioned for continued growth and profitability.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;These were painful decisions,&quot; Weinstein added, &quot;but they allow us to invest in critical areas like mobile and marketing in 2013. This industry is still very, very young, and we&#39;ve learned a lot about how to succeed in it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Young Internet companies can often take several years to reach profitability, and LivingSocial is no exception. The company&#39;s $650million net loss in 2012 compares with a net loss of $499million in 2011, when its pace of hiring and acquisitions was at its fastest.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There was a bright spot in Amazon&#39;s filing: LivingSocial&#39;s revenue, it reported, climbed to $536million in 2012, more than double the $250million it raked in the year before. That increase is largely attributed to daily deal revenue from the United States and successful overseas markets, such as South Korea, as well as its newer lines of business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A source close to LivingSocial said chief executive Tim O&#39;Shaughnessy told employees in a meeting last week that the company is expected to turn a profit sometime this spring. (O&#39;Shaughnessy is the son-in-law of Donald E. Graham, Washington Post Co. chairman and chief executive.)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s very tough in eight lines of someone else&#39;s filings to be able to parse out what the business story is behind&quot; the loss, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of deference to Amazon, which did not return calls seeking comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Throughout the year, LivingSocial shuttered operations in the Middle East, Netherlands and Mexico. It then recorded an impairment charge of $579million in the third quarter after several newly acquired companies proved to be less valuable than LivingSocial anticipated.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Even if it was a one-time write-down in value, it&#39;s another marker for how that business in general is struggling in the international arena,&quot; said Daniel Kurnos, an analyst at Benchmark, a market research firm.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In November, the company eliminated about 400 jobs in the United States, including 160 positions in the District.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LivingSocial has added new lines of business, pitching offers such as travel getaways, restaurant takeout and live events, but has yet to replicate the initial success it found delivering regular discounts to subscribers&#39; e-mail boxes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The question is: Does the market still have growth potential?&quot; Kurnos said. &quot;I think the answer is yes, but it may not be to the same level it was initially perceived to be.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:overlys@washpost.com">overlys@washpost.com</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191%;text-align: left;">Thomas Heath contributed to this report Document WPCOM00020130131e91v000d4</p></body></html>
